I also have a Soulra XL.  I expected the Eton products to have decent sound, but was surprised at just how good they are.Some may think they are more of a novelty item, since they have a solar panel on them to charge/power the device.  And the solar panel is a nice feature, as you can use it to charge up the device, or for just playing the Rukus when you are out in a park, at the beach, or just in your yard, and AC power is out of reach.  But the Rukus is mcuh more than a novelty.  It has superior audio reproduction, solar or not.What's in the box?* Eton Rukus XL* AC Adapter* Owner's ManualThe Rukus has an 8 speaker system, consisting of 2 woofers, 2 tweeters, and 4 passive radiators.  It has 22 watts of power.  These are the same specs as the Soulra XL.  Thus the sound is pretty much identical.  About the only thing the Soulra has over the Rukus is a cushioned shoulder strap.Where the Soulra has a dock and is meant for docking Apple products to charge, play, etc. the Rukus is Bluetooth/wireless, so you can stream music from any Bluetooth device.  The Rukus has a USB port so you can connect/charge devices.  Like the Soulra XL's dock, the Rukus' USB port is in a covered compartment, so you can keep your iPod, etc. safe while charging.You also get closer to 8 hours of playtime on a Rukus, a huge improvement over the Soulra's 5 hours of playback time.  As far as charge time, it takes about 4-5 hours in bright sun.The control panel is pretty typical, except for the solar charge \"\"battery\"\"  icon.  Everything else is your basic Power, Volume Down/Up, Bass Boost,  Aux, Play/Pause, Reverse, and Forward.The jacks for auxiliary items and power are hidden under a rubber boot on the side of the Rukus.I do miss the carrying strap as it was convenient to use to cart around the Soulra.  The Rukus weighs about 7 pounds, same as the Soulra, and is about 14 \"\" x 5\"\" x 8\"\", maybe \"\" smaller than the Soulra, so a strap would have been nice.  But other than that, the Rukus is awesome.  It has clear sound, undistorted even when the volume is turned up.It is simple to use, pairs easily, charges at the press of a button, and the solar panel folds up and down smoothly.Again, the sound produced from the Rukus is outstanding.  The battery life is great.  The ability to charge your phone from teh Rukus is a super nice feature.  Simply put, the Rukus is a `5' all the way around, were it not for the absence of the carrying strap.  That might seem picky, but at 7 pounds and the size of the Rukus, a portable device should have a strap, especially in this price range.\"", "You get plenty of BOOM and BANG for your buck.  The Eton Rukus XL is a highly durable solar powered radio.  You get a rich, strong sound.  You can even find a place to fit your phone.This is really a good outdoor product and it does come equipped with operating buttons that allow you to move it ahead, behind or stop.  Although it has no remote, you can do quite well with the buttons.  It is very user friendly.Power and a strong rich performance is what you get with this gem.  Since it is solar powered, you can count on long stretches of use.  It is ideal for outdoor gatherings such as picnics, pool parties and informal outdoor get togethers.  You can also use this to charge your phone.", "You know they had to have called this the Rukus so people could say that, right? Right. That said, this is one of the best Bluetooth speakers I've owned. If you have the kind of money this thing costs, there are basically 2 models worth looking at that I've tried, the Logitech UE and this. The Logitech has ever so slightly better sound but this thing has feature upon feature upon feature that may make this the ideal gadget for you.To start with the sound, since I don't want to feel like I'm knocking it, this bad boy is loud and proud. It's a good loud too. It'll shake the room, wake your neighbors and might even interfere with satellite broadcasts. Only at the absolute highest volume do you get any bass distortion, which is really just about the only difference in sound quality between this and the Logitech UE. Are you a sound quality fanatic? You should look there. Do you want more features? Read on.It charges via solar power. You already knew that before you made it down to this review, but did you also know it has a USB port so it can charge your speaker and your phone or MP3 player at the same time? If your outside you can pretty much run this thing indefinitely. Some people say it doesn't have a handle, but that little slot in the front operates as a handle just fine. Battery life is really good after dark. At about 80% volume I ran for about 4-5 more hours. That was simply because I didn't bother to plug it in.This speaker is bad to the bone. If you read the features list and you're thinking this appeals to you, you're right. Add to cart.", "\"This is a very nice bluetooth speaker that reminds me a little of the boomboxes back in the 80s.  We have several docking and bluetooth speakers around the house but this this might be the largest and it's the only one that is solar-powered - which I think is actually a cool feature.  The solar panel fits against the back side of the unit but pivots up and can be adjusted to a better angle for the sun, but it doesn't charge very quickly unless it's direct and bright sunshine.  (It can also be charged with an included auxillary cord.)  The box says it charges in 5 hours and that the charge will last for 8, but I think that's an estimate based on playing at high volumes as mine seemed to do better at lower levels.  When not used much, however, the charge still drops fairly quickly - although that is perhaps misleading since the charge indicator only shows \"\"fully-charged,\"\" \"\"half-charged,\"\" and \"\"low-charge.\"\"  The instructions recommend sliding a switch on the side (which is covered by a rubber flap) to \"\"charge off\"\" to conserve the stored charge.I like the look of the Eton Ruckus - triangular on the side; about 8\"\" high by 14\"\" wide and about 5\"\" deep at the bottom.  It's wireless but there is a compartment to store your bluetooth device (I used my iPhone, which I had no trouble syncing).  The iPhone doesn't \"\"dock\"\" inside but there is an elastic strap to secure it.  I found I could simply place the iPhone inside (not using the strap) and close up the compartment door without any trouble.  There is a USB plug inside the compartment for charging the phone but a cable is not included, and an input plug for auxiallary devices (like an iPod shuffle) is included on the side (under the rubber flap).  I also thought the sound was very good but only when the \"\"bass boost\"\" button was pressed - otherwise it sounded a bit weak.The Ruckus is advertised as portable but like others have mentioned the \"\"handle\"\" - which is designed into the top front part of the unit - doesn't exactly feel like a safe and secure way to carry it.  I have long fingers and can't get much of a hand-hold on it.  Still, at about 7 lbs its lighter than some of the old 80s boomboxes.  My other concern was with the weather resistance.  With a solar panel it's obviously made to be used outside, and yet isn't water-resistant to much degree.  We took it to the beach (and it charged marvelously with the solar panel!) and while we kept it up off the sand and there was no wind, I still found sand in many of the crevices afterward, even inside the front compartment with my iPhone.  The buttons on the top are rubberized, but it still doesn't inspire much confidence that you could use it worry-free outside.  Still, it sounds really good to me.Pros: solar-powered, good sound, good looksCons: small handle, no remote, no docking station, not very weather resistant\"", "The days of carrying a 50 lb boombox on your shoulder are long gone, but may very well return if boomboxes were replaced by the Eton Rukus XL.  At 7 lbs, this Wireless Sound System has all the bells and whistles that any 80's child would only dream of!Setup and charging of the unit is very simple - either lift up the solar panel to harness solar power, or plug it in.  Your music player is connected via bluetooth, and set up for that takes about a minute.  I've set up my iPhone 5 and iPad via bluetooth, and both work fabulously without dropping out.  For the size,  the sound that comes out of this sound system is great.  Loud enough to get a party started, but not so loud that it is overbearing.  With the bass on, the sound is much richer.  We brought our Rukus to the park and it's really convenient because we didn't have to pack batteries or rely on putting it near the jump house generator.  The sound was good and I was able to stow my iPhone (in a case) in the charging dock area so it wasn't just lying around on the table.  The reach for bluetooth is pretty good - when at home, I use this unit in the kitchen and can walk into the next room with my phone and the sound won't drop off.The convenience of this sound system is great - I use it this around the house when cleaning, when I want music while cooking, and in my kid's room when they want to listen to something and I don't.  I haven't had to charge this unit in the wall yet!  One thing I don't like about the Rukus is that if bluetooth shuts off for some reason that the unit will beep continuously until you turn the unit off.  This is both good and bad - good because it reminds me to turn the unit off, bad because it will continue to beep every 10 seconds or so to remind you.All in all, this is a really nice portable speaker unit.  It's convenient to tote around, sounds great, and utilizes solar power so you don't have to constantly buy batteries.  Highly recommended!", "I love this music boom box- I am always working on in the yard, and pasture and I have kept my Note II blasting music and staying charged for over five hours- The clarity and sound is great, and it keeps my phone charged when the battery starts getting low. I have another Eton solar music player for my ipod, have had for over two years and its still working awesome- Eton products are great!", "[Edit: 12/16/13. I've been using this quite a bit in the yard and it's been working so well and sounding so solid that I think it's proved itself a real winner. I'm calling it 4.5 stars instead of 4, as I've found nothing at all but good things about it, aside from what I mentioned in this review. But for those who like to listen music outside well away from outlets, and hate wasting cash on endless batteries, this thing is truly excellent. It's at 230 here now, which I still think is a tad high, but it sure has been making our afternoons funner, and the battery life really does get near 8 hours even after much use. If that price is fair to you for your needs, you won't regret this cool little party box.]4.5 starsThese things are good about the Rukus:Sound is quite pure, with the passive rads adding smooth mids and solidity to the bass. Good round tone all in all, very digital friendly.Bluetooth hookup is very easy and works well once on, no dropouts, but pluggin the cord into your device gives better sound and more volume, no doubt.Cool rubber buttons and efficient controls.Good call to offer a usb port for computer etc charging, and an aux input for non-bluetooth devices. Buy a mini stereo to mini stereo cord and leave it wrapped up in the cellphone compartment!Attractive pyramidic design with a good angle to disperse the sound well. Highs travel better this way.Wonderful to be able to charge it via the sun, perfect for isolated camping if someone is ok with lugging about 8 pounds extra. AC charging and playing is also built in, a big plus.The battery puts out just under 8 hours when new. Very nice considering a full sun charge is 5 hours.Not so good are these things:It's heavy but not too heavy, yet a real portability negative is the non-existent handle. Just a little grip port that makes you use two hands or cradle it in your arms if you care about this thing not dropping. You can carry it with one hand, just be careful!CAUTION: The solar panel tilts up, which is sweet, but if you leave the panel all the way up so the sun hits it and the front grille at the same time you will soon enough dry out the speaker cones, as direct sun ain't friendly to paper. So make sure to leave the panel facing the sun while raised only an inch or two out of itssocket. You'll make your speakers last much much longer.No radio? No radio! Why not? Simple feature that takes up almost zero space, as digital tuners are fingernail-sized now. Not including a tuner is a major error, I think.It could also easily have a 2 or 4 or 8 gb chip in it that took mp3 and flac files. Simple and cheap, another real oversight.All told, the Rukus' good sound and wonderful solar capability make it a fine companion for backpackers and campers who need tunes and don 't mind some extra weight. At 200 it's a good deal, and if it drops to 150 or lower it would have to qualify as a real steal.Let's hope this is the tip of an iceberg of autonomously solar-powered devices of all sorts! My house has 3kw of solar panels but I can't take that juice with me when wilderness camping, and this dedicated type of panel makes staying off grid and still enjoying rocking tunes (and Karajan's 1962 Beethoven's 9th) in the mountains a splendid reality.Using the sun to produce music is a lot of fun, and makes a lot of sense.", "\"The Rukus XL 22 watt wireless sound system is attractively sleek and solidly built. Sound output is great, and that's its best feature. I appreciate the versatility of having a replaceable Li-ion battery that charges either by solar power (fully charges in 5 hours) or with an AC adapter. It charges smartphones through a USB port.  Connecting wirelessly to the unit via Bluetooth is very simple, and so is connecting via the USB or audio input jack.  Sound quality is excellent through any connection method, but does becomes slightly distorted at maximum volume.For a sound system advertised for outdoor use, Eton sure does include a lot of weather related stipulations in the user manual.  Here are just a few: \"\"Do not expose this apparatus to dripping or splashing. Do not use this apparatus near water. Do not leave the system in a place subject to direct sunlight (except when charging by solar panel). Protect from humidity and rain.\"\" Those conditional instructions pretty much discourage many of the outdoor activities I had in mind for the sound system--boating, near the pool, camping, etc.  As much as I enjoy using and listening to the Rukus XL, I wonder how long it will hold up if used extensively outdoors.Better unit protection would certainly help.  There are only two ways to transport the sound system--either by an ill-designed handle or picking up the entire unit, which measures 8\"\" high x 14\"\" long and weighs about 8 lbs.  A carrying case sure would have been useful if for no other reason than to protect the solar panel.Overall, the Rukus XL does a great job delivering personalized music, but I am afraid to use it to its full extent for fear sun and moisture will play havoc with a sound system that only has a one year limited warranty.  Five stars for sound performance, three stars for questionable outdoor durability.\"", "First off, this does not have a radio, contrary to what some of the first reviewers say in their reviews; although I wish it did come with one.This paired almost instantly with my phone. Your phone can be placed inside the charging area and there's a protective cover to keep your phone, no matter what type, in place.I had a Boom-box in the 80's - the sound quality of the Rukus is 100X better!  Room-filling sound if indoors for a medium/large room but outdoors cranked up all the way, there is a little distortion. Where I live (condo with a backyard and neighbors close-by) this provides more than enough sound without cranking it up. Even with the Bass Boost on, the bass isn't the thumping-window rattling type. I have a hard time describing my opinion on the sound quality (I'm an average person, not an audiophile, but I love good sound albeit most great sounding speakers are out of my price range). The Rukus sounds a lot better than 99% of computer speakers, even better than my Bose PC speakers, but not as good as high-end bookshelf speakers such as what you'd find with an indoor-only sound system. If that makes sense!Ever since this arrived a week ago, there has been no sun where I live, so I've had to rely on the AC adapter for charging. I'm glad I have that option. Charges fast, and a charge lasts long enough for the time I spend listening.Two complaints: (1) I wish there was a more substantial handle *rubberized like the buttons* for carrying - this has a built-in handle but don't trust it for carrying as this weighs 7 lbs. and it's slippery plain plastic, and (2) for what this costs, the inclusion of a radio would have been nice."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.004983670078217983, 0.11727362871170044, 0.015043830499053001, 0.26771289110183716, 0.3792530298233032, 0.09825854003429413, 0.00014157869736663997, 0.11486095935106277, 0.00247182440944016]]}
