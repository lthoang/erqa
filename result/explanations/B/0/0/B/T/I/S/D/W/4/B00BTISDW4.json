From cheap $20 ones to pricey ones like this $200 GHD. Some are worth their price, most are not. So my thought on this GHD Cady Collection styler are in comparisons to my other irons.I have very long and thick hair that needs to be flat-ironed after blow drying or else it's just a giant poof of thick hair that's uncontrollable.  I have a CHI Smart Volumizing Styling Iron, which is okay when if want super slick and straight hair, ironically, with little volume. The CHI makes my hair straight and smooth, but a bit too flat and lifeless. So flat, it tends to make my hair seem stringy.I have theRemington S9500in both the 1 and 2 inches sizes. These are decent straighteners and work well at a budget price. I own thePanasonic EH-HS95-Kwhich is a pretty neat idea for a flat iron, helping keep hair from being dried out. But the Panasonic doesn't as hot as most flatirons, and because of this it can't really tame my thick poofy hair. Up till now, theTS-2 Millennium Professional Flat Ironhas been my go to styler. Despite it's less-than-flashy looks, it's been the perfect flatiron, with all the others falling short.This GHD styler however works every bit as well as the TS-2. It straightens my hair as well as the CHI, but without going too far and making my hair lifeless like my CHI does. I can get my hair to look exactly like I want it to, like I can with my TS-2. So why choose this GHD over the TS-2? This styler gets hotter and does so really FAST. All my irons say on their packaging they get hot fast, but they don't. This one does. Instantly fast. So fast that the first time I used it I burned my hand because when it beeped saying it was ready, just seconds after turning it on, I didn't believe it.Also this GHD is smaller than the TS-2. It's a more normal/traditional size and shaped flatiron. The TS-2 is an extra long iron, which is great for thick hair, but can be difficult to travel with. The GHD is a super simple styler too. One simple on/off switch. So if you're one who wants to be able to control the heat temps on your flatiron, you can't do that with this one. It goes from off to blazing hot in seconds. No middle settings.This GHD Candy Styler is awesome. It tames my hair, is ready instantly and is the perfect size and shape. However because it's so perfect, it has a decent size price tag to go along with it. If you want the perfect styler, you'll love this GHD. If you want something that's works really well but can't quite swing the $$$ for this one, check out theTS-2 Millennium.", "I admit I am quite amazed by this flat iron. It is my 3rd one and by far the best. What I noticed immediately that sets this apart from my previous flat irons (Revlon, Chi) was that this does heat up instantly but does not get so hot that while using it my hair is quietly smoothed rather than the crackling I normally hear. I was able to use it very quickly and even go back over a section of hair a second time without the fear of burning my hair to breaking.That is the worst thing with flat irons in general is that they are so hard on hair and split ends and whole sections of hair can break off leaving a jagged edge. So far I am not experiencing any of that and my hair is unbelievably soft and smooth with no visible damage. I am attributing this to the fact that the GHD iron doesn't seem to overheat.Other pluses is that it is very well made & the rotating cord which helps to avoid kinks and tangles, and the fact that the plug has a reset button and the voltage is regulated so that it can be used universally without a converter. (tho an adapter might be needed for plug insertion.) It will also shut itself off within 30 minutes of disuse which is a great safety feature.I suppose the negative is the price. Despite the quality of this item the price is rather exorbitant and quite frankly the life expectancy of a flat iron seems to be pretty short and they burn out within a couple of years. So it remains to be seen, if I can get several years worth of use from it then it might be a fair investment.ADDENDUM: After using this for a few months I am less than pleased with the cord as it is stiff and kinks easily. Cheaper hair appliances have better cords than this.", "\"The GHD styler does indeed curl or straighten your hair, but for $200, I expect to be WOWED, not to just be able to say, \"\"Yeah, it works.\"\"Pros:*The color is beautiful.  It's bright, sunny, and vibrant.  Who wouldn't want to have this kind of positive vibe in the morning?*It's lightweight, so it won't tire out your arms and hands as much as some other products.*The cord is plenty long.*It heats up quickly (almost instantly).*It shuts off automatically after 30 minutes.And that's about all you get for your $200.Cons:*The styler is lightweight and smooth (nothing to keep it in place), and the cord is long and heavy.  It's gonna go where it wants.  Don't leave it unattended even for a moment.*The on/off switch is INSIDE the styler.  Granted, it's not right next to the hot plates, but it just doesn't seem like a good idea.  People aren't very coordinated in the morning.*There is no temperature control!  This one is really a mystery.  For $200, I want to be able to choose how much damage I'm doing at once on my hair!This isn't an awful styler, and I must admit I'm not greatly experienced in using one, so the reviewers who rave about this one might just know more about stylers than I do, but I was just kind of disappointed with this, especially considering the price point.\"", "I got this styler for my former foster son's 18 year old daughter, who I call my &#34;niece,&#34; Kayla.I've known Kayla since she has been one. She is very much an utter perfectionist on her hair (she has changed the color and style several times) and is starting a promising modeling career. She has had some cheap stylers. She absolutely loves this styler and here's what she just emailed me: &#34;I really love the straightener and it's the best I've had. It heats up within seconds and even beeps when it is finished. It makes my hair soft and shiny. My hair never stays straight but this straightener keeps it nice and straight all day. And since my hair is damaged it gets very frizzy and this also keeps my frizz down. I love it and I would defiantly recommend it!  Worth every penny!&#34;", "I've owned several flat irons over the years, but this is the one I love the most. It literally takes just seconds to heat up, and then it is powerfully strong. I have very thick, curly hair, and sometimes when I've tried to straighten it in the past, people have actually asked if I curled it because it just wouldn't get straight enough. Not only does this iron give me stick straight hair, it also leaves it looking like it still has body.In addition to the quick heating and the ability to truly straighten, this iron allows me to straighten my hair quickly. I can get my whole head done in about 10 minutes because it allows me to do large chunks of hair at a time. In fact, it seems to work better when I work with thicker chunks of hair at a time. It also allows me to straighten practically down to my scalp for a natural look.I love the way the cord is built into the handle--it swivels easily so that it doesn't tangle on itself; and it's also long enough that I have the versatility to use it just about anywhere. When I use this straightener, the results tend to last for several days, and my hair does not look fried or dried out.", "Good looking, lightweight yet sturdy, slim, love the yellow.One temperature option (safe), beeps when it's ready (about 15 seconds, but gets hot instantly, so I don't wait for the signal).Smooths hair, instead of making frizzy, static mess like my cheaper Remington frizz therapy flat iron.The style holds well even by itself, no need for a hairspray for me (I use curlers for my bob, and than make few strands straight and slightly flipped outside), but maybe it's my hair not the styler, not sure.Very happy with this one!", "I believe the Chi brand to be the gold standard for flat irons.  I have owned a Chi for years and I have always been happy with it.  Other brands have never been able to straighten and smooth my hair as well as my Chi.....until now.  I will say that this GHD flat iron works as well as a Chi.The iron gets very hot and that is important when it comes to straightening my curly, thick hair.  It also leaves my hair very straight, smooth, and silky.  One advantage that this product has over the Chi brand irons is that it heats up VERY quickly which is helpful when you are in a hurry.If you are looking to invest in a high quality flat iron I think you would be happy with this product.", "Add a little color and style to your bathroom with GHD's lemon-yellow 1-inch professional styler. Teens will especially like this heating iron for either curling or flattening. The styler uses ceramic for even heating. This limited edition candy collection will be a hit with any young woman who prefers bright colors. The iron has a sleep mode for safety. When it hasn't been used for 30 minutes, it will automatically shut off."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.05928825959563255, 0.16391120851039886, 0.17081107199192047, 0.07474732398986816, 0.11631567031145096, 0.14192338287830353, 0.15060113370418549, 0.12240194529294968]]}
