"], "reviews": ["These are so convenient and my two year old loves how they taste.  What I love is that unlike a lot of kids snacks, there are no harmful or unhealthy ingredients in them. I'll definitely be trying more flavors (I think we'll try theFruit Friends Squeezable Fruit, Apple Strawberry,  4-Count, (Pack of 8)next.", "OK, I guess at my age I'm not the target audience for this particular product. But after watching my granddaughter enjoy hers, I couldn't resist. We enjoy sitting together for a breakfast before the bus comes, so this makes a nice neat way to get a fruit into her in the morning. No mess!I thought it tastes a lot like a combination of baby applesauce and bananas. What I enjoyed about it was that coming out of the fridge it was very cold, and it made for a refreshing thick drink, a bit like a kids smoothie.I am deducting a star because I had difficulty getting the lid off, and if I struggle as an adult, a child will most assuredly need help.", "These portable pureed fruit packets are easy to tuck in a lunch box or brief case. With no sugar added, they contain all fruit' in this case apples, blackberries, raspberry juice, banana and vitamin C. The top screws off easily and it is resealable. I tasted primarily apple with a suggestion of berry but no banana at all. The texture is smooth. Although I prefer fresh fruit, this is a convenient way to enjoy the benefit on the go. They are mess free with a pleasantly bland flavor. It is a fun way to wean kids off more sugary snacks and is ideal for the ailing. The expiration date was July 2014. Recommended.", "The box says this is not recommended for children under 36 months, but I have no idea why. It looks just like all the squeezable purees I feed my son. I got this for my 16 month old, he nearly eats everything I eat so I don't know why this would be bad for him. He sucked it right down with my supervision and he loved it.These squeezable are even smaller than what I normally fed him when he was younger. And it says 100% real fruit, no added sugar, No artificial flavors, colors or preservatives, and No apple juice concentrate added which is what the younger puree foods say as well, so why not for kids under 36 months? I just don't understand. But regardless, at 16 months my sons ate this and really liked it.", "What an innovative concept: natural fruit in a three-ounce tube one can suck from.  The only additive is ascorbic acid (Vitamin C) Although opening one requires muscle, this device prevents massive spills.  This is good for a younger child who may not be entirely table-trained yet, although this product is not recommended for children under the age of three.While the tube says apple, berry and banana, I primarily taste tart apple.  The texture and color is that of applesauce.  Most of the content does come out, which prevents a high percentage of product loss inside the tube.While definitely not filling, this makes for a decent snack while on a road trip or during a day hike.  The contents last at least a year unsealed.  Once empty, the tube is flat and doesn't take up much space.  Even the price isn't bad for 32 tubes.I'd buy these again.", "My kids loved this Fruit Friends smoothy-like all fruit drink.  They like the taste a lot, they like the way it's packaged and consumed, and I liked the ingredients.  It went really fast.", "Although this product is mainly marketed for children, it's also a great way to have a fruit snack while driving. Very easy to use - screw off the top cap (which can be a bit stubborn) and you're all set for a mess-free, no napkin needed fruit snack.The taste is heavy on the raspberry side. It's not bad, but I would have preferred to have more of the banana flavor come through. The raspberry (and other berries in it) make it just a bit too much on the tart side for my taste.I like that there's nothing in it but fruit and ascorbic acid. It's also shelf-stable, so no need for refrigeration until opened. Great option for snacking.", "\"I love these pouches. And so do my kids. They are easy for on the go because they do not require any utensil and they are (usually) mess-free. They are healthy - 100% fruit, no sugar added, no preservatives or artificial flavors, no GMO's, and BPA free. They are great for kids who have eating limitations because they are both dairy free and gluten free.I was surprised to see \"\"Not suitable for children under 36 months,\"\" on the packaging. It is followed by \"\"Always make sure a responsible person is present when your child is eating\"\" so I assume they just don't want younger kids to eat by themselves without supervision.I would give these 5 stars except that they are a little pricey per snack (I do splurge occasionally though due to the convenience).\"", "I sometimes pack these squeezable fruits in my lunch bag.  It may be hours before I get a break at work and so when I do, something quick and easy is great to have on hand.  I liked the flavor of the Apple, Berry Banana; it wasn't artificial tasting at all and it was a good combo. The price per pack is about average for these treats, but because of the taste and no added sugars I'd easily recommend Fruit Friends. I just wish it was made in the USA.", "While I'm kind of philosophically mixed about the squeezable food pouch trend (I think it's a little weird for bigger kids with perfectly serviceable fine motor skills to be sucking on a pouch of applesauce instead of eating an apple or a dish of actual applesauce), if you're comparing apples to apples (ha ha), these are a pretty good standard example. I get that parents like a shelf-stable snack they can throw in the glove box or lunch box, but I don't like the trend of unnecessarily substituting processed food for fresh. And while I'm a little judgey about the pouches, I'm a total hypocrite and do keep a dozen in my pantry for when I'm too busy or lazy to fix something fresh or when I don't think ahead far enough to thaw out baby food. I try not to rely on them too heavily for both the expense (2-3x the cost of a pint of applesauce) and packaging waste.It's your basic pouch applesauce with other fruit puree added for flavor variety. I took off one star for the fruit juice, which makes it more like a drink than a food. I'm anti-juice, and the more of the solids you remove from a food, the less satisfying it is for your appetite.I did like that the pouch was the right size for the contents. It's less a trend with the applesauce marketed as a snack than the ones marketed as baby food, but I'm sick of seeing pouches 50% larger than this for the same contents. These snacks produce enough waste as it is, so it's satisfying when the company doesn't use additional excess packaging.", "What the kids thought:I gave my kids the new Fruit Friends squeezable fruit and one of them loved it and one didn't so for taste tests, we had a 50/50 result.What Mom thought:I liked that they are convenient and provides no mess eating. I sent the rest of the pack to school with my son that loved it. His school is completely nut-free and their snacks must also be healthy so sometimes it's hard to find an appropriate snack for school. These made a perfect send-to-school snack.Fruits Friends is 100% fruit with no sugar added. If you are wondering what exactly it is like I did, it is basically an applesauce type puree that is put into a nice squeezable container which makes it great for snacks on the go.Each pouch has 45 calories and 12 carbs. All natural and pure ingredients. Only needs refrigeration after you have opened the pouch.", "These are yummy squeezable fruit. My kids love the apple berry banana it is so easy to eat. I don't have send a spoon in their lunch and never get it back. It makes fruit seem way more fun to eat. These are perfect for kids.", "This is a handy portable shelf stable fruit mix. Great for lunch boxes, after school, snacks, picnic or anytime. This Apple Berry Banana tasted good. MY 2, 4, and 13 year old loved the flavor. I tasted mostly apple sauce with a little strawberry and hint of banana.gluten free, dairy free", "My two-year-old and six-year-old absolutely loved these, and I loved that I could throw one in the diaper bag to bring on the go. The product contains only fruit and no food coloring, which also appealed to me.", "I liked the idea behind Fruit Friends Squeezable fruit Apple Berry Banana. Portable, tidy fruit is a great idea. The container is nice and sturdy. It works for little hands. The lid was easy to use. The only shortfall is it just takes like apples with a little banana. Apples are way cheaper than berries so it makes sense. Other than not having much berry flavor, I think these are a good idea. While I rarely buy prepared treats, I will buy these for hikes and camping. My kids are out a lot and I think these are perfect.", "My toddler loves on the go fruit pouches and this one was a huge hit. He liked them so much he helped himself to 3 in one day. The flavor is really good and they are non staining so far. The pouches make them easy to stash in a diaper bag or a glove compartment for on the go snack emergencies. I like the combo of the apple with the berry and banana and all the ingredients were things I approved of. The price is good and the product is even better.", "Decent taste but odd consistency. I love that these are healthy, but eating fresh fruits and veggies are healthier and taste far better. While my 7 year old didn't care for these (she prefers fresh fruits), my neighbors 4 year old loves them.", "\"I was expecting the Fruit Friends Squeezable Fruit to be a juice drink; however, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that it is a delicious applesauce with some berry juice and banana puree.  I couldn't' taste the banana puree but I definitely tasted the berry juice (composed of my favorite berries: blackberry and raspberry), which made the applesauce sweeter.  Those on a diet will be glad to know that each 3.2 ounce serving has only 45 calories; however, there are 9 grams of natural sugar.  Stamped on the back of the product is a \"\"Best If Used By:\"\" date of JUL 02 14.  Therefore, the product was fresh when I received it.The Fruit Friends Squeezable Fruit is easy to transport.  Each package is made of a plastic that is not prone to accidental tears.  The red twist-off cap, however, was hard to remove and I spilt a tiny amount of applesauce during the process.  There is a great deal of packaging waste.  I carried these applesauce servings to work and consumed them as mid-afternoon snacks.  I ate them along with Kellogg's Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Mixed Berry [Nutri-Grain Cereal Bars, Mixed Berry, 8-Count Bars (Pack of 6)].  They make an extremely delicious combo.  I recommend the Fruit Friends Squeezable Fruit as occasional treats for children to carry with them to school or extracurricular events.Joseph B. Hoyos\"", "My wife and I keep fruit drinks in the fridge for the nieces and nephews who descend on us when their parents need a break, so we thought the Fruit Friends might be a nice change of pace. We only intended to sample one apiece, but we liked them so much that we finished off the box of four. We both loved the taste, and fortuitously, I didn't see anything objectionable in the nutrition information. No added sugar was the clincher for me, since there are not many fruit snacks that can say that. Total carbohydrates are 12g, which is okay for me as a diabetic (my snack limit is 20g), and there's 1g of dietary fiber. At only 45 calories, it's a very good mid-morning or afternoon pick-me-up that I don't have to feel guilty about.I'm looking forward to trying the other flavors of Fruit Friends.", "Fruit Friends Squeezable Fruit is just fruit and fruit juice in a convenient squeezable pouch.  I have tried many products in very similar containers and they are all equivalent (terrific) as far as the packaging goes.  Also like most competing products there is no added sugar etc., just fruit and a little fruit juice.  The flavor is better than most that I have tried and my kids really like it.  It tastes like the ingredients: apple, blackberry, raspberry juice, banana.  The banana makes the consistency just right.", "That's what I heard when I gave the first one to a little person.  When I tried one for myself, I thought the same thing!  The first flavor I got from theFruit Friends Squeezable Fruit, Apple, Berry Banana,  4-Count, (Pack of 8)was the banana.  The berry and apple come through a moment later and there's a bit of tartness in the mouth after the entire pack has been consumed.  We had ours very chilled and I've placed a couple in the freezer for tomorrow.  At first, I thought these would be great added to a smoothie but I think it is good enough alone as it's intended.  I always keep small packs of applesauce (unsweetened) in the refrigerator and use them often in cooking and baking.  Because of the complex fruit flavors, I'll stick with simple applesauce for those purposes and will enjoy these on their own.  My only criticism is the residual tart aftertaste, but I can live with that.", "I think that the packaging is really cool because it's pretty much just apple/fruit sauce in handy dandy little packets. It's really convenient to pack. And unlike regular apple sauce you can't spill it on yourself unless you really tried and it's easy to eat.It tastes pretty good but it was a little sour. I can taste the apple and the berry and banana. Other good things: no GMOs, no preservatives or artificial flavors, BPA free and 100% fruit. Nutritional info: 9g sugar, 1g fiber, 15% RDA vitamin C and 2% RDA Iron.Summary: A 3.2oz serving of pureed fruit in an easy to use packaging.", "\"Fruit Friends Squeezable Fruit is a nice \"\"on the go\"\" snack for kids.  Our kid's school is fairly strict about snacks and have a ban on junk foods coming in (the Kindergarten food police are in full swing!).  I was relieved to find this item passed the snack police!  There's no added sugar, the flavor is good, and my kids LOVE these things.  While we don't plan on eating these often (fruit is a much healthier option) this is a great item to throw into a purse or diaper bag for a snack when on the go.  Please note that these packages are pretty small - much smaller than a Capri Sun - so your kids may want to eat more than one.\"", "This is basically unsweetened applesauce with some other fruit added. The kids like it a lot. I think it's just ok, but my palate is much more spoiled by sweets and spices than theirs. I am not a fan of the excessive amount of packaging, but sometimes when you are on the go that is helpful to have. While we enjoyed trying this and definitely wouldn't turn it down if offered one, I don't think I will be in the habit of buying them because the packaging--especially the plastic caps and the box--seems wasteful.", "It's hard to tell from the photo, but these are small containers. Perfect for children's small hands and stomachs, but too small to quench the hunger of an adult.I enjoyed the combination of berries and applesauce, but was a little put-off by its ultra fine texture. It reminded me of baby food. But I can see why they have it that way, seeing as how the neck of the pouch is very small - they don't want it to clog. The screw top lid is a nice touch, kids can eat part and throw the rest in their lunch box without fear that it will spill.I think kids will like the idea of squeezing it out like toothpaste.A tip for parents: The first pack opened very easily for me, but the second one didn't. It was a struggle to snap it free. With this in mind, you might want to go ahead and loosen the caps if you put this in lunch boxes for small kids.", "My son LOVES these things!  One box was gone within 48 hours!  He absolutely loved them.  And I love that it's made of fruit, with no added sugar.  I always like to give my kids fresh fruit like apples, bananas, oranges and clementines as often as possible, but sometimes I run out or the last couple pieces go bad before I have time to go to the store, so these are great!  It's definitely not a fruit/vegetable replacement by any means, but it's a great alternative to things like fruit gummies that I don't like to buy for my kiddo.We will definitely buy more of these!", "My little nephew taste tested this for me.  He's quite a fan.  I think he also liked feeling the package (bright label also a plus).  But the proof is in the taste: all grins.  However, pleeeeease note that this can be very messy in the hands of small ones (as I so truly discovered).", "I was surprised how much kids love this squeezable fruit!  Older kids try to take it away from the younger ones, everyone loves it.  i will buy this again, it is very popular in my house!", "Fruit Friends squeezable fruit is a squeezable, 3.2 oz. (90 g) container of applesauce flavored with blackberry, raspberry juice, and banana, with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) added.  The package has 45 calories.Compared to an apple, this product has a lot of wasteful packaging, but it does taste good, has simple ingredients, and is lots of fun.  Best of all, the youngsters love it!", "My 3 yeard old and 10 months old love the pouches. I tasted and yes it's good. It's all fruit so there is 9 g of sugar per pouch so it's ok as occasional snack. Nothing will replace real fruit.", "This is a great idea. We all loved the flavors. I have to say this was great on the go, on a bagel, even on toast. My kids takes them to school, and like that they do not have a mess on their clothes when outside playing. Great nutrition having on hand for kids playing sports.
