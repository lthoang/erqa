The KIRA i7 uses the Windows 8 Pro operating system and this operating system is so much more advanced that it is overwhelming at first, but overtime you will get spoiled (because surely I am). This ultrabook is super fast and there is no stalling or slowing down and this is important for me to have a computer that can actually keep up with me. The screen on The Toshiba KIRA i7 is nice and bright.allows you to see clearly as well as touch the screen to navigate through your laptop. The touchscreen is really nice because I can adjust the size of texts and zoom in and out on pictures.The camera takes amazinly vibrant pictures and video. The homepage is easy to use and I like that all of the main functions are available on this one page. The Toshiba KIRA i7 includes a two year free subsciption to Norton Internet Security, a two year Platinum warranty that covers any issue that may arise with you laptop, and this laptop also includes Adobe Premiere and Photoshop Elements.I am really enjoying this laptob and my only concerns are that there is no disc drive where you can watch a dvd or listen to a C.D. and the speakers are on the bottom of the ultrabook and this causes the sounds to be sort of muffled. I think that adding the speakers to the top of the laptop and adding a disc drive would make the KIRA ultrabook perfect, but other than those issues I love the Toshiba KIRA i7 ultrabook.", "Honestly Toshiba's Kira computer is none too impressive at first blush. At least from a visual package opening perspective. The laptop is in there and it looks presentable, but Toshiba laptops do not have the same wow factor as Apple products have. Aesthetics are passable but it does not impress as the aforementioned competitor. It is very light and has a nicely designed casing with a lighted very impressive keyboard. My first initial impression was that I was to be disappointed by the Kira because of the cheap power cord. Surely it can not be that good of a laptop and have this chintzy of a power cord. So initial box opening presentation I think the Toshiba Kira can improve.However, I was horribly wrong about my initial presentation. This little lady with a plain smile has a heart of gold and the speed of an Olympic runner. The Kira computer is ready to perform within 10 seconds of being turned on. Unbelievable speed. I upgraded my laptop from an ASUS UL80 to the Toshiba Kira and it feels like I traded in the old minivan for my first corvette. I love the speed and its ability to be able to perform within seconds of turning it on.The Kira is my first introduction to a touch screen laptop. First off the screen is just brilliant. I find myself switching  from my Kindle to my Kira for reading purposes. The screen is just that enjoyable. Smooth, sharp, and bright all at the same time. The screen handles HD videos and movies without a problem. Secondly, I find the touch screen function to be incredibly precise and responsive. I rarely find myself using the mouse anymore. It is extremely easy with just a flick of the finger to scroll through a web page.As far as complaints, why are the speakers on the bottom of the laptop? Whenever the Kira is on my lap the sound is muffled and the sound is irritatingly muted. I don't understand why the speakers couldn't have been mounted facing me. One other complaint is that it is very simple to accidentally turn off the mouse if you are not careful.All in all this is a very good laptop. A little pricey but I think you will be very satisfied with it if purchased.", "I love it but a bit expensive. I would love it more if it did not cost me so much money. I still wonder if it was worth getting.", "\"To review the Kirabook, you are best off starting without knowing the price, because once you see it, you'll question everything about this machine.Lets start with the basics - this version is one of three different Kirabook models - the base is an i5, 256GB SSD and 8GB of ram with a 2560 x 1440 pixel display.Next up is the same machine, but with a touch screen, and at the top, is the model in this review - a core i7 3.1GHz, 256GB SSD, 8GB and touch screen. At $1999, it is by far one of the most expensive Windows 8 machines out there, without getting into Workstation or rugged models.The Kirabook does come with a premium package of extras - 2 years of warranty, concierge service, relatively bloat-free, Adobe Photoshop Elements, Premiere Elements and a suite of Norton. Unlike most other machines, these are all FULL versions without any \"\"trial\"\" nags.In the box is another box with the actual laptop, a cheap looking AC charger and an assortment of quick start guides and a warranty card.So - lets go through the machine itself before comparing to its competition:On the outside, I have to say that the Toshiba just isn't all that striking. It looks like a cheap HP DM series. The chrome trim is just tacky, and the machine would look much better without it. Ports on the left include power, USB and HDMI. On the right is one more USB port, multi-audio in/out and an SD card slot. It does feel well made, there is no flex in the keyboard and the case is certainly not the usual squeaky mess you'll find on a $300 machine. Sadly, the SD card slot is not \"\"full depth\"\", so any cards in it will stick out, making it impossible to keep a card in it when traveling. There is a single LED showing the charger status on the left, but no HDD or power LEDS anywhere.On the inside things are a bit better - the keyboard is backlit and of MUCH better quality than recent Toshibas (like the Z935). The trackpad is a single slab (Synaptics) and also lacks the horrid buttons of the recent Portege.The screen is definitely the highlight of this machine - it is the first Windows laptop with a 2560 x 1440 pixel display (the Chromebook Pixel with the first computer with one). Yes - the screen is amazing, but Windows just isn't made for the resolution. Most things look ok (like the Metro interface), but other apps don't know what to do with the resolution. Chrome looks blurry, other apps show the text in the tiniest size you've ever seen. This inconsistent experience actually becomes annoying.Bottom line - amazing screen, but there just isn't much you can do with it. Unlike the iPad, there are no Windows app specifically designed for \"\"retina\"\" style screens.Performance on the i7 model is as to be expected - blazing. This machine will certainly do well for your heavy video and photo work, but to be honest - the power comes at a price - heat. On the bottom is a fan / jet engine. Without exaggerating, when the fan comes on, it actually sounds like the jet whine you'd expect from a plane. It is so loud, that it drowns out music when the volume is set to 50%. Also, the fan is on the bottom, so if you use it on your lap, bed or other soft object, the heat can't escape - there are no side vents.The machine has Bluetooth, but only basic WiFi using a pretty basic Intel Centrino N2230 adapter (which means no 5GHz wifi). For a premium machine, it should come with dual band.Also, the speakers are touted as \"\"Harman Kardon\"\", but they really are just basic - they are down-facing, so place the machine on a bed or sofa, and the sound is gone. Little to no bass.But the biggest issue (and why it gets four stars instead of five) is that it just feels like Toshiba didn't go all the way here. Lets compare:Chromebook Pixel - comes in a gorgeous box with a very slick compact power adapter with cord that wraps around it. The machine feels amazing from well machined aluminum.Zenbook Touch - same well designed power brick, screen wipe, carrying pouch, Ethernet to USB adapter, MicroVGA adapterToshiba Kirabook - decently designed box, very cheap power brick (same one as used on their other machines) - and that is IT.There is no Ethernet port on the machine, so you will need to buy one if you need it, and there is no case included. For a machine so heavily geared towards its design, it really should come with a simple slip cover.And finally, there is the price - the base model touch is $1799, which is $500 more than the Chromebook Pixel (which has a miserable 32GB HDD and of course runs Chrome), and also $500 more than a Zenbook Prime Touch (which has lower ram/SSD on that model). Still, most people do not need the high resolution screen of the Kirabook. Amazingly, the Core i7 Kirabook is actually more expensive than the similarly spec'd Apple Macbook Air 13\"\" - considered one of the more overpriced machines on the market.Other things to keep in mind - this machine can't be upgraded, so what you get is what you will need to live with, but with the specs out of the box, you should be fine. The pre-installed software leaves about 184GB free of the 256GB SSD. Boot time is in the seconds - so they clearly used a speedy SSD inside. The machine has a standard HDMI port, so you don't need any expensive Displayport adapters. It lacks HDMI, there is no fingerprint reader option, and even though the USB ports are black, they are USB 3.0 (most USB 3.0 ports are blue), but this is a nice touch to blend in.And finally, unlike every other Windows 8 machine I've used, this one boots up and makes you connect with a local account instead of starting with a Microsoft account, so you'll need to switch that out if you want the full Windows 8 sync options.Bottom line - it is definitely one of the nicest machines Toshiba has ever made, some of the highest specs on the market, but about $500 too expensive for what you get. If you have the money, you won't be disappointed, as long as you don't remind yourself every day how much you spent on it.\"", "Wow! I thought getting a thin, lightweight laptop meant I had to settle for a slower one with less capability. Not so!This is the fastest, sleekest, best device I never thought existed... and, sure, the price tag is steep, and it's obvious that it's aspiring to be the PC alternative to the MacBook Pro, but THIS IS AMAZING. (Granted, the touchscreen also adds a tablet-ish aspect, which I like.) The sound quality is good, and the laptop handles multi-tasking well. I like being able to use either the keyboard (love the feel of it and the backlighting) or the touchscreen, because I find times when I prefer one or the other.My one complaint is that the cooling fan is at a terrible location if you're planning to use the laptop anywhere but a desk or table. It's on the right back corner of the computer (under the P on your keyboard), and whenever I use this as a true lap top computer, my thigh or knee is blocking the fan. I can work around this by using a book or another flat surface, but I wish the fan had different placement.", "\"When it comes to laptops, I'm at a point in my career when I am no longer willing to compromise in terms of performance and style. That mindset costs me a little more in terms of the purchase price of a new machine, but when I consider that I usually keep a laptop a minimum of two years, then the premium I pay for a truly state-of-the-art laptop like the Toshiba KIRAbook 13 is about $1 a day more than a model with weaker specs and FAR less style. To me, that's the definition of \"\"affordable luxury\"\" and given how many hours of use my laptop gets, it's well worth it.I had an opportunity to test both KIRAbook 13 touchscreen models--the i5 and the i7--before deciding which one to go with. On paper, the differences are negligible. The KIRAbook 13 i5 has a 3rd gen Intel i5 processor and the regular version of Windows 8. The KIRAbook 13 i7 has a 3rd gen Intel i7 processor and Windows 8 Pro. If you're not hung up on processor specs, or need the few incremental features of Windows 8 Pro, then save yourself $200 and go with the quite-capable i5 model.My testing involved a number of real-world scenarios that relied on the software tools I use on a daily basis--the Microsoft Office 2013 suite, the Adobe CS6 suite (InDesign, Illustrator, Lightroom 4, and Photoshop primarily), and various other programs that are RAM and storage hogs. I also did a lot of testing of media files like streaming video, downloaded 1080p video files, super-high-resolution graphics files, and streaming radio and music. The media tests gave me a good idea of graphics throughput and the ability of the large 256Gb SSD to perform when massive amounts of data were being written to the disk. The final set of tests were benchmark tests designed to see how well the hardware performed in real life vs. rated speeds published by the manufacturers of specific components.I'm not a big fan of wordy, highly technical performance reviews like the ones you might find on Tom's Hardware, so here's what I learned - in plain English:Processor performance: The i7 is definitely faster in terms of the benchmark scores, but the real-world difference is negligible unless you're using industrial strength software like Photoshop or InDesign. Those programs are going to tax any processor, and you will definitely notice a meaningful speed boost when you're driving the i7 KIRAbook. For me, that kind of performance bump alone is worth the extra $200.SSD performance: Incredible. The KIRAbook throughput is faster than any SSD-based machine I have used, and is as good as anything on the market. Boot time is awesome, as is awake from sleep (one word: instantaneous).Graphics performance: Also incredible. The Toshiba KIRAbook has the highest resolution display of ANY Windows laptop and it is absolutely STUNNING! Anybody who works with spreadsheets or programs with tons of toolbars (like the Adobe CS6 applications) will LOVE the expansive real estate you get with that display. Watching a movie is a joy, as well, and I would offer that once you've experienced a 1080p movie on the KIRAbook display, you will absolutely hate having to watch one on any other laptop.In terms of head-to-head testing, the machines are nearly identical in every meaningful way. The i7 is faster in certain applications, and Windows 8 Pro does have legitimate incremental value for power users and those who work in corporate environments. Aside from that, the two machines are identical twins.For me, the real test wasn't i7 machine vs. i5 machine, it was Toshiba KIRAbook vs. the competition. I have a background in graphic design and product development, and how a machine looks and feels is as important as what's under the hood--sometimes more so. Toshiba really nailed the design of the KIRAbook. Sure, it's as light as a feather compared to most laptops AND ultrabooks, but I'm not as concerned about engineering feats as I am about what the machine feels like in my hands, and how it looks on a conference room table next to my colleagues' machines. In this regard, the KIRAbook kicked a**. No matter where I used one of these laptops, people would come up and want to see it and try it--particularly that Retina-quality touchscreen. I love it when a device I own elicits a response like that, and I can assure you that that alone is worth the extra $1 a day it will cost you to own the sexiest computing device on the market.The Toshiba KIRAbook 13 i5 and i7 models are BOTH fantastic performers and genuine head turners. Want one? Go for it!\"", "\"Finding a laptop that you like is typically like finding a needle in a haystack. Whether you personally like a laptop comes down to form, function, and features. This laptop by Toshiba, although a good performer for every-day use, seems to struggle with some moderately intensive tasks, and has a few quirks to boot.I'll start off with the things I immediately don't like:1. Exhaust fan placement: the exhaust fan is located on the bottom of the unit, toward the upper right -- let's say under the letter \"\"P\"\" of the keyboard. The laptop's slim form factor probably requires this placement -- the laptop is so thin that it would be impossible to position it elsewhere. However, this placement makes it next to impossible for the laptop to cool itself effectively if it's on your lap (typical) or on some other \"\"non-flat\"\" surface. You probably will use this on a bed, on a sofa, or on the floor. The vent for the fan is effectively covered when placed on such surfaces. The rear edge of the laptop is slightly raised to help provide a gap for cooling when used on a perfectly flat, hard surface, but this is defeated when placed on any other surface. Other than the cooling fan, there's only one other small vent that probably serves as an air intake. It's easy to block both. The end result is that the laptop sometimes audibly struggles to cool itself, even when doing something as mundane as watching a video.2. No Kensington Security Lock slot: the lack of a Kensington security lock slot boggles my mind, especially on a laptop of this caliber. If you are going to be traveling with this laptop, and want to lock it up in a hotel or other area, you really need to lock it away. There's no way to lock it to a table or any other object to prevent theft. I can't forgive this oversight.3. No VGA output connector: yes, I know, technology is changing. This laptop includes a standard HDMI output. While that's great, not every device you are going to encounter has an HDMI-in. Older monitors are typically hardwired with VGA cables, and if you plan on using a projector, chances are it won't have an HDMI-in. I know this was done to save on the form-factor and keep the laptop thin, and I know adaptors are available that will make it work, but it extremely limits the number of existing devices to which you can connect.4. No physical switch to disable wireless: while the F12 function key doubles as a \"\"softkey\"\" to disable wireless, allowing you to toggle \"\"airplane mode\"\" on or off, there's no physical switch to permanently turn off wireless.5. SD slot does not allow for full insertion: when you insert an SD card into the laptop, half of the card will hang out of the laptop. If you are using an SD card to expand memory, or simply to transfer files, this presents a hazard to the SD card. You have to be careful not to bump it, and you have to take it out before storing for travel. The card doesn't lock into place, so it's possible it can just fall out. It also makes it a visible target for theft.6. No indicator for drive activity: There are only two indicators on this laptop: the power-on LED, and a small \"\"wireless\"\" LED. There's no way to know when the laptop is accessing data on the SSD (this laptop uses an Solid State Drive as opposed to a Hard Disk Drive), or whether it's doing anything in general if things start running slowly or seem to hang.7. Speakers are on the bottom: this is another thing I can't forgive. If you have the laptop on your lap, the speakers are against your clothing. Granted, I know laptops aren't actually meant to be used on your lap (but that's how people use them!), but if our faces are facing the screen and keyboard of a laptop, I don't understand why speakers are placed on the bottom of the laptop. It quite often will result in less-than-optimal sound.8. Trackpad clicks are extremely stiff: the clickable trackpad seems very stiff when clicked. I've used other laptops with similar pads that are much more forgiving when clicked. Many times, I get the wrong click response -- a left-click is registered instead of a right-click. I've reviewed the settings and haven't been able to resolve this. It reminds me that nothing beats \"\"a good old mouse\"\".9. Solid State Disk size: the installed-and-not-replaceable SSD is 250 GB. A lot of people will find this limiting. The usable space on delivery is about 180 GB. While you can free-up some of this space by removing installed applications and components, the only way to add storage is externally. Photos, music, and especially videos will eat this limited and fixed storage space quickly. Expect to do a lot of archiving to external drives or to the cloud. Or just deleting things, which is what I have started doing.All of that said, how does it perform? Quite well actually. I think the combination of 8 GB of RAM, the 2.0 GHz CORE i7 processor, and the Solid State Drive (SSD) offer incredible boot-up and speed with common tasks. From a sleep-state, it's ready-to-go in under 10 seconds when you lift the screen. Applications open quickly, and file transfers from external drives are lightning-quick (again, I attribute this to the SSD). In Windows 8, the system earns a 5.7 on the \"\"Windows Experience Index\"\", limited only by the integrated graphics. For reference, the scores are: Processor = 7.1, RAM = 7.5, Graphics = 5.7, Gaming Graphics = 6.5, and Primary Hard Disk = 8.0.Physically, I like the design. While clearly mostly plastic, the metallic coating is a plus and virtually eliminates fingerprints -- it's like a stainless steel finish for a laptop. It's light and extremely thin. It's barely thicker than a USB connector. All of the connectors are on the sides, and the four rubber feet on the bottom will keep it positioned on a table-top.The illuminated keyboard is a plus, although personally I keep this feature turned off to conserve battery life. However, having the option to type in the dark is welcomed. I consider this a great high-end feature.Battery life has been exceptional, far better than any other laptop or portable device I've ever used -- but again, I attribute this to the low-power requirements of a Solid State Drive. On a full charge, the battery reads a full \"\"8 hours available\"\", but after about 90 minutes of use, this drops to about 6 hours of available charge. Granted, this number is highly variable and probably depends on what the laptop is being asked to do at any given time. Still, it's the best battery life I've ever seen, especially only when surfing the Internet or doing other mundane tasks such as writing reviews. Your ultimate battery life will depend upon your power settings, of course. I tend to be aggressive in order to maximize battery life...your mileage may vary. Charging takes a while, several hours to go from a low (under 15%) charge to a full charge.The screen is beautiful. My middle-aged eyes cannot discern a single pixel -- this is the closest to \"\"print\"\" that I've ever seen. It's bright and sharp. Personally I use it on the maximum resolution -- which for this laptop is 2560x1440. Watching a movie or TV show is as \"\"HD\"\" as it can get. The touch screen is responsive -- exactly the same as using any smartphone. My only complaint about the screen is that it is not as \"\"fingerprint\"\" resistant as the manufacturer claims -- my screen is smudged all over the place. While this effect dissipates when you turn on the laptop and the screen illuminates, when the screen is off, you can see every single place you've touched the screen. Regular cleaning will be necessary.The wireless chipset in this laptop is very good. I am on a 50 Mbps connection, and on the other side of my home, about 60 feet from the wireless router, on the first floor, through three walls, I manage to get a 25 Mbps speed-test result via wireless-N. Signal strength is always excellent, and I've never received a pop-up that the connection has been lost.Sound quality is exactly what you would expect from a laptop. It features a Harman/Kardon sound system, so sound is marginally better than what I've heard on other laptops, but don't expect \"\"movie theater\"\" sound from such a small system. The one feature I do like is software processing that enables 3D and \"\"surround\"\" effects, which is interesting while watching movies and TV shows. I can clearly hear sounds behind me when using this feature. That said, the speakers are on the bottom, and this ultimately can affect the quality of the sound you hear, especially if it is on your lap.What if you want to use this laptop for some more intensive tasks, such as 3D gaming? While this laptop scores a 6.5 in the \"\"Windows Experience Index\"\" for \"\"gaming graphics\"\", that means you'll typically get a \"\"standard\"\" resolution and performance out of it. I ran a benchmark test for a Final Fantasy game, and the result is that it will run \"\"good\"\" at 720p at about 30 frames-per-second, but the laptop generates an intense amount of heat, and the exhaust fan kicks into \"\"very high\"\" speed -- to the point that it sounds like a jet engine. The benchmark test scored this as \"\"standard\"\"; however, I would be afraid of the long-term implications of running a modern (current release) game on this laptop for many hours -- the heat alone could probably cause some long-term damage. That said, casual gaming on this laptop is more than fine. High-definition video may also produce similar noise from the exhaust fan, which I've experienced on occasion, especially when the laptop is positioned...on my lap.The laptop includes a copy of \"\"Adobe Photoshop Elements 11\"\", and the laptop processes and produces previews of an image's modifications in a relatively short period of time, although not as quickly as I thought it would. However, the combination of fast processors and plenty of RAM means you can make adjustments to settings and view the results on-the-fly with relative ease. It's adequate for my use, but I am not a full-time photo-editor.In general, the laptop build -- which includes the hardware and software combination -- has been extremely stable. It has not crashed after regular daily use in three weeks, and has only been rebooted when prompted by updates to Windows 8. Otherwise, I keep it in standby and it is always ready-to-go. Note: I won't get into the operating system (Windows 8), because my focus is on the hardware performance, but I will say this laptop is well-designed to take advantage of the \"\"touch\"\" aspects of Windows 8.I think this laptop places \"\"form over function\"\", in some respects. I know it is challenging for manufacturers to get certain features into a laptop when they are trying to maximize its form, especially if they want to make it as thin as possible. However, the number of things that I listed as obvious oversights or problems cannot be forgiven in a \"\"high-end\"\" laptop. It performs well, it has beautiful form, but the lack of some features and the design decisions made for others keeps this from being \"\"perfect\"\".\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.020574789494276047, 0.009381946176290512, 0.3848258852958679, 0.0018606563098728657, 0.5809770822525024, 0.000632964598480612, 0.0017466534627601504]]}
