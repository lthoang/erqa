So my comparisons to features and sound are against my other sets, such as the Turtle Beach Ear Force XP300, Corsair Vengeance 2000, Turtle Beach MW3 Ear Force Bravos and the TRITTON Pro+ 5.1 Surround headphones. Up to this point, my go-to set was always the Turtle Beach Ear Force XP300. Even the Surround Sound of the TRITTON Pro+ series wasn't enough to make me give up my XP300's. They were just an all-around better set. However these XP510's have finally given me a reason to put away my XP300's.Right out of the box I was shocked at how similar looking this XP510 set was to the XP300. Short of the neon green quilting on the head piece, it is almost identical to the XP300. Same weight, size, color, everything. Same cushioning in the top of the head piece. Same comfort for wearing during long gaming sessions. The initial set up is different. Both sets use Bluetooth for their audio. This lets you chat and hear game sounds completely wirelessly. But one big difference between them is the transmitter. With the non-Surround Sound headsets like the XP300 and the MW3 Ear Force Bravos, the transmitter is smaller than a deck of cards. With the surround sound sets, they have a much larger transmitter, similar in size to a wireless router. Also, rather than using AV cables from your TV to your transmitter, you're using a digital optical cable from the transmitter to your PS3/xBox.Where this set really blew me away was the in-game sound. I'm a pretty dedicated COD player (multi-player), and while I play all kinds of other games as well, I've found one can usually get a good idea at how well a set will perform when using it while playing a FPS. I'm familiar with what games like Black Ops 2 sound like in Surround Sound, since I've played it using my TRITTON Pro+ set. I assumed this set might sound similar. To my surprise, I found the XP510 sounds even better. Turtle Beach has done an awesome job of taking all their best features from sets like their XP300, and put it into this XP510, then adding the Surround Sound. While the sound from the TRITTON set was good, it just wasn't great for first person shooter games, like this set is. When playing RPGs or very music oriented games likeJourney, the TRITTON set is great. But within few seconds of the first round of online play, I could tell this set was made for gamers.There are a number of sound presets in this headset, so you can scroll through them to find the best sound for the game you're playing. You go through them by pressing the option buttons on the side of one of the ear cups. The presets vary quite a bit in their settings, so you can easily find one that works well for your game. In addition, if you find you're not a fan of the Surround Sound in some of your games, you can easily turn it off and use this set in stereo.As usual with Turtle Beach, the mic works well and tends to be the clearest of my sets when talking online with others. Because the mic is Bluetooth, you can easily answer calls from your Bluetooth enabled cell phone. There is a dedicated answer phone button on the side of the set for taking calls. However my favorite aspect of the Bluetooth is using my MP3 player with the headset. Often times I like to listen to music from my iPhone or tablet while playing online with this headset. With the Bluetooth turned on, I can sync my phone with the headset, then turn on my music to play in my phone, and it plays both my music and I can hear game sounds at the same time through the headset. This also makes things easy when I have an incoming call. My music shuts off and the game sounds shut off, and with the press of the answer call button on my headset, I'm able to talk to the caller right through the headset, without needing to stop my game (an invaluable feature for those who play live online multi-player games, where there is no such thing as pushing \"\"pause\"\").The rechargeable sets are so much more convenient than headsets that require batteries. I can play through multiple several-hour gaming sessions before I need to recharge this set. If you're not using the Bluetooth the whole time or every time, the set lasts many hours longer than the technical specs say it will. When I have the Bluetooth off, the set seems to stay charged forever. There is an auto-off feature as well, so if you forget to turn the set off, it will go off on its own.After using this set for some time now, I realize why I like it so much. When I first compared the XP510 set to my XP300 set, I wondered what would be different about them, since they seemed so much alike. I then realized that its similarities to the XP300 that makes it a great set. The XP300 is an awesome headset, and Turtle Beach took that set and found ways to improve it. The added Surround Sound in this incredible.I would also suggest this set over other Surround Sound sets such as the TRITTON Pro+ for anyone looking to buy a headset for kids, teens, or anyone else who may not enjoy trying to find just the perfect sounds settings with the Surround Sound. Some sets, like the TRITTON Pro+ don't use sound presets. They are designed with a series of button settings that you adjust up and down to control the front, back, center and sub speakers. These are great for those who enjoy being able to adjust every detail of the speaker settings for their gameplay or movie watching. However they aren't as pick-up-and-play friendly as sets like this XP510 are, with built in sound presets. I can spend an hour adjusting every last setting on my TRITTON set, and can't get the sound as perfect as I can with the press of a button on this Turtle Beach set.If you're interested in this headset, but find the price is too steep, I'd suggest checking out theTurtle Beach Ear Force XP300set. It's got most of the great features that this set has, just without the Surround Sound, and at a much lower price. But if you're looking to buy the best of the best, I'd say this XP510 is definitely it!\"", "We have used mid-range wired Turtle Beach gaming headsets before (Ear Force X11 Amplified Stereo Headset with Chat, the out-of-production elder brother of the X12), but this one is a different level. Sound quality takes a huge jump here, with both richer sound coming in and clearer sound going out. There's been no interference at all.Set up was easy - after charging the unit, we plugged it into our Xbox 360 and TV, and it was good to go. Recharging is done with a separate cable to the headphones powered by the 360. Since set up, my 15 year old son has barely removed these - at least, to the extent that school and homework allow. He has worn them probably an hour a day on weekdays and as much as 12 hours a day on weekends since set-up. He loves them. He raves about their comfort and sound clarity and is very happy with the charge they hold.We have only dipped a toe into the Bluetooth functionality. If they could somehow manage to stream texting, it might be more popular with him, but his friends don't generally dial the phone. Music streaming is not going to see much use from him, since he'd much rather listen to the game he's playing than provide his own soundtrack. However, it does seem to function well.My one gripe is the size of the manual. I suppose I should be grateful that they included one and didn't just make us go online as so many products do these days, but this manual got the better of my aging eyes. I couldn't read it even with my reading glasses on. I'm not going to downgrade it for that (small gripe, especially with set-up as easy as it was), but it would be so nice to have a functional font.His former headsets were certainly functional; if these are out of budget, Turtle Beach has other options that may satisfy many gamers for much less. But if the indulgence is affordable and the gamer hardcore, this high-end headset could certainly be well received.", "\"Ever since my son got his first Turtle Beach headset several years ago, that is the only brand he really wants to use.  We've tried some cheaper models in the meantime but he always returns to this brand for the following reasons:Sound:  The sound on this headset is exceptional.Microphone:  Wireless chat is easy.Batteries:  The battery life is great.Accessories:  Comes with everything you need.While not the cheapest headset out there, it is true that \"\"you get what you pay for\"\".  For a serious gamer, this is a great headset.\"", "\"The Turtle Beach Ear Force XP510 has mind blowingly good audio. Bullets whizzing by your head, footsteps, atmospherics. You hear it all. Those bullets? You perceive the sound as traveling past your head--the headset does a great simulation of time and space. I've owned other wireless headsets which have had annoying clicks, static, and other issues, presumably the result of competition on the wireless band from other devices. With the Ear Force XP510, not one. That problem is solved.The headset's sound quality is so good, it makes you overlook its annoying quirks. What are those?** Anything to do with the bluetooth chat. Chat sound quality is good. But it turns itself off all the time. One advantage over earlier headsets is that it announces when it is powering on and powering off.** When it decides to turn itself off generally. Yesterday, I had a quiet moment in a lobby. I decided to turn on the bluetooth. The bluetooth powers on. But then 10 seconds later, presumably because it had not received any audio input from the lobby, it turned itself off. If the device was a little smarter, it would have any user input received supersede the automatic turn off timers.The problems with this headset are really most likely the result of having to interact with the Xbox, a technology that is really almost eight years old.Speaking of that aging technology, if you are connecting your xbox to your tv via HDMI, you probably need an analog work around to get sound to your headset.Courtesy of Amazon reviewer Mike (original post located here, if you want to mark helpful:Hdmi Cable and Adapter for Xbox 360)on how to do this:\"\"The cable that came with my xbox would block the hdmi port when plugged in, so I couldn't plug both an hdmi cable and digital audio in at the same time (my receiver doesn't have hdmi). However, it is a fairly easy process to remove the plastiic casing around the cable with the digital audio and then both will fit - and it works like a charm.Just take a flat edge screwdriver to the crease in the side of the casing, give it a light tap with a hammer if necessary, and the plastic casing will pop off. Once this is done, both cables fit without a problem. You may want to wrap with electrical tape once the casing is removed.\"\"If this solution weirds you out too much, Turtle Beach does offer an adapter itself.Ear Force Audio Adapter Cable for Xbox 360. I bought an off-brand adapter, but it did not work. I have not tried Turtle Beach's solution. Make sure you have the right version for your machine.Overall, the xp510 is about as good as it gets. It provides excellent sound quality while eliminating tethering wires. The design decision to have chat bluetooth turn off with inactivity in order to save battery life was not a good one by Turtle Beach, but overall this headset is fantastic.Highly Recommended. Less one star for the bluetooth chat and powering off issues, otherwise perfect.\"", "So I started off using this headset for the one application that isn't listed as supported, PC Gaming (Bioshock Infinite specifically). As long as you have a sound card with optical output it works just fine for output. However, if you want to use the microphone you'll have to buy an accessory to convert from separate mic/headphone  jacks to a unified jack like the ones on smartphones or the xbox 360 controller (there is an included cable for connecting either size) and the connection for the mic is on the headset so you'll lose wireless. Something I've noticed with the few PC games I have is that, unlike most console games, they don't support Dolby Digital or DTS. So, although the sound quality was excellent and the headset was incredibly comfortable,  I found that it wasn't heads above the not insubstantially less expensive headset I was already using. At this point I decided I needed to check out the Dolby Digital capabilities with my PS3. I normally wouldn't consider using headphones for my PS3 as my media room is equipped with a roughly $7,500 surround system. I popped in Assassin's Creed Revelations (my game queue has gotten out of hand) into my PS3 and I was shocked. I don't know if it was the headsets excellent Dolby Digital reproduction, its noise cancelling that effectively silenced all background noise or if it had to do with the Pioneer Kuro Plasma and the fact that I rarely get to turn the volume on my surround system loud enough. But I haven't been that immersed in a game sensorily in a long time. I'm sure the sound design in Assassin's Creed helped with that immensely, but the precision with which sounds were placed and the crystal clear separation and balance of individual sounds was very impressive. Enough gushing, there is one more really cool feature to this set. It can be paired to two devices simultaneously. So you can have it paired to both the PS3 and your phone at the same time and it will function like a stereo bluetooth headset for you phone. And with the noise cancelling features, this is almost a necessity if you want to hear your phone ring. So when a call comes in it slightly lowers the game volume and a ring tone goes off and you can press a button on headset to answer the call. Its done very well, the ringing is very unobtrusive and to my shock I could both clearly hear the game audio and the person on the phone, more so than if they were in my media room trying to talk to me while my surround system was going. If you do most of your gaming physically alone, this headset, I hate to say it, is pretty tough competition for my surround system and a fraction of the cost.", "If you are in the market for a headset I don't think you could do much better anywhere else almost regardless of price.You can't beat wireless either.  Its nice not having your head tethered.  Wireless requires charging of course and this has not been a bother to this point. I plug it in when I am not playing and never have had it run out on me.The set is nice and comfy and doesn't bother my glasses.  Many headsets squeeze my ears to my glasses and it can be uncomfortable but I don't have that problem here.The mic works great, I haven't had a single problem in that department.  I have a couple of the mics around and it always seems like people are telling me they either can't hear me or its garbled.  Nobody has commented on my voice quality with this mic at all.The sound is great.  I would like a little more bass, but it does have a lot, I just like bass.  So take that as you wish.I can definitely recommend this headset.  Its quality built, sounds great, lasts a long time on a charge and is comfortable to boot.", "\"I have owned many high-end gaming headsets over the last 5 years. I'm the kind of guy that likes to \"\"trade up\"\" when new stuff comes out. Many times the trade-up doesn't make too much of a difference after the initial thrill of having the best wears out, but I don't see that happening with this system. It's incredible!Here are my opinions after having it a few weeks:1. They're super-comfortable. The headphones are nicely padded on not only the ears, but on the top as well. And even though there's all this padding, the set fits perfectly on my bigger-than-average head. They also feel good after long play sessions, without the sweaty ears and headaches that others have given me in the past.2. The sound quality is excellent and well-balanced. This is important because sometimes these things can be too bass-forward, which is nice for some games, bad for others. In other words, they sound perfect on everything from Bioshock: Infinite to Madden to Peggle. Also, the Surround Sound on this is remarkable. It's hard to believe how well you are immersed in these.3. Set-up was easy and pairing was quick.4. Battery life is excellent. I have only had to charge them once so far. At 15 hours a charge, I won't need to charge them too often, which is more than I can say for my Playstation Move controller. ughIn conclusion, I'd highly recommend this set. Even without utilizing all the features, I found it to be worth the price tag. If you plan to use it for your home theater or Skyping, that makes is all the more appealing.For the average person who games regularly, a headset is something you really only have to buy once, so you might as well get a good one and enjoy years of quality.\"", "I'm a bit surprised by all the really negative reviews out there.  I'll give my own account.  I got this for use with my PS4.  I've used them both for playing games and for watching movies and tv shows (netflix via Ps4 and straight blu-rays).  For all these uses they've been terrific.  Certainly the best headset I've owned.  The sound is superb, I find them to be very comfortable (I've worn them for hours at a time and honestly forget that they are even there after awhile).  The range is also impressive.  I've walked into other rooms to get a snack of whatnot and just kept them on and can hear the sound nicely.I haven't honestly given the mic a workout yet, as I haven't played any games that have needed it.  When I speak I can hear my own voice in the headset though, and it sounds ok.The one complaint I have about it is the setup.  Omg.  If some of the reviews are because people haven't set it up properly I can empathize.  If you bought this to use with the PS4, the instructions it comes with are useless, and their website is a disorganized mess or information.  I can honestly say I spent a couple of hours trying to assimilate all the relevant info and get it installed properly.  It's not really that complicated when it comes down to it.  A couple of pages in the manual would have made it clear as mud, it's pathetic that Turtle Beach doesn't bother to do that.  So I take one star away for that.", "Turtle Beach Ear Force XP510 Premium Wireless Dolby Digital Gaming Headset is the best gaming headset I have ever come across.  It has a huge list of features and the sound is fantastic.The battery life lasts up to 15 hours, even if the headset is constantly turned on.  The adjustable volume switch located on the headset controls game volume conveniently and easily.  The headset has eight different programmable settings that allow you to make presets for specific games.  The amplified sound allows you to hear people trying to creep up on you from behind - no other headset that I've tried works nearly as well.The all around feel of the headset while wearing it is great.  The memory foam ear pads form to your ears and provide an extremely comfortable fit.The wireless option is fantastic.  It allows you to move around without worrying about ripping the headset off of your head.  The optical audio is crisp and clear.The only complaint I can possibly come up with is that if you hold down the mute button on the headset it will turn the headset off and then turn it back on again.  Other than that, this is a highly recommended gaming headset, and the best one I have ever tried.", "I got this headset to use with the XBOX 360 for gaming, but it does so much more.  I have having wires all over the place, and this is an elegant solution.  The base station sits near the XBOX (it uses the optical audio cable from the XBOX for sound), but it is small enough to place out of sight behind the home theater.  The headset then pairs with the base station, and viola, you have sound and voice communication.  That, however, is only the beginning.  The headset also uses Bluetooth, so you can pair it to your iPhone/iPad as well.  We have it paired to my son's XBOX and his iPad.  The Bluetooth setup is just as easy as pairing with the base station.  The sound is simply amazing.  Somehow, it is able to generate sounds that appear to be coming from behind you, which is great for gaming.  It has multiple presets that allow you to do things like amplify the bass for explosions, or footsteps for strategy.  After playing around with it, however, we found the default Game 1 setting to be the best one.The headset is not limited to its wireless connections, however.  It comes with every conceivable cable for every use.  It has a standard headset plug for wired music, another to connect directly to the XBOX controller.  It even includes the optical audio cable, which many other manufacturers would have left out.I have tried numerous Bluetooth headsets over the years, and this is by far the best for sound, comfort, and battery life.", "After about three weeks of usage, I can safely say these Turtle Beach XP510's are the best headphones I've ever used for gaming.  When considering sound, functions, options, and comfort, these simply can't be beat at this price range (and I'm guessing more expensive headphones might still not be as good as these).  I've used many video game headsets from Turtle Beach, Creative Sound Labs, Tritton, Monoprice, and others, but these are the hands down winner among them all.The first thing you notice is the slick presentation.  They come in a lavishly made, embossed box that holds the headphones and all the accessories in one stylish case.  You'll look forward to prying these out of the box each time you get your game on.  These are also the most comfortable headphones I've ever used, and this is continually a major issue for me.  Even when I've used other headsets that sound great, they get cumbersome and extremely uncomfortable after only minimal use.  There is some nicely stitched padding on the head ring, and the ear cups are soft and plush like those of a pair of nice Sony monitor headphones.The sound that pumps through these is amazing.  Like their corded counterpart, the XP Sevens, these headphones produce a perfect mixture of highs, mids and lows.  I've found that most video game headsets in this price range cater to the bass fanatics more than they should, but this pair of phones just get it right.  There are eight different presets that will cover whatever situation you're in.  I tested tested these with Skyrim for the Xbox 360, Black Ops II for the Xbox 360, Bioshock Infinite for the PS3, and Tomb Raider for the PS3.  The ambient noise in Skyrim, the explosions and helicopter chatter from Black Ops II, the clang of metal in Bioshock Infinite, and the lush jungle sounds of Tomb Raider were all perfectly presented and I used a different preset for each one.  Really stunning detail, and I've never heard their equal.The bluetooth function works like an absolute charm.  I used this with my iPhone 4 and iPad 3, and it all worked like a charm with minimal hassle or headaches.  I had no problems hearing the other party on my phone, and they heard me just fine as well.Another nice bonus of this headset is it comes with all of the cords you'll need.  I can't count how many times I've broken open a pair of gaming headphones and realized I needed to purchase a separate sound enhancer, optical cable, or whatever.  It's all here, and you won't need to scour the internet for what you need.The best part is that this is a wireless set.  That fact alone, mixed with all the other factors, is what makes these the absolute best headphones you can buy for under 300 dollars.  Turtle Beach's XP Sevens are just as good as these sound and comfort wise, but those are wired.  If you're going to spend the cash, why not get a nice wireless set and free yourself of hassle and cords?  I've had no trouble with connection, wifi, or signal issues, and sound mixed with voice integrate flawlessly through the wireless connection.  I've experienced no lags, drops, or distortion, even whilst cranking the volume and speaking into the mic at the same time.  Perfect.I've used at least 20 headsets in the past five years, and these are quite simply the best I've ever used.  Sure, they're pricey, but if you want the complete package with no detail uncovered, these are the hands-down pick you need to make.", "The XP510 is nearly everything I could hope for in a headset. It has sound quality that surpasses the Logitech's G930, Sony Pulse Elite Wireless Gaming Headset, Razer Megalodon, along with nearly every other brand of gaming headset. Not only does it have great sound and microphone quality but it also is very well build and feels extremely comfortable. Along with working with Xbox and PlayStation it also works with any Ipod or MP3 player, which in addition with its 15 hour battery life adds up to a great mobile music machine. While these were still being shipped to me, I was reading other reviews and talking to friends about them, and quite a few people seemed to think that the XP510 would be able to be used with a computer. So when they arrived after I tested them out on my Xbox and PS3 I decided to find out for myself if they really did work for a computer and unfortunately after hours of trying, I realized that they just wouldn't work for a computer. Overall these are a very solid and reliable headset that are worth every penny and I would recommend them to any of my friends except those looking for a headset that is compatible with a computer.*EDIT*I tried this using a Bluetooth 4 compatible macbook and the audio quality was much worse when using Bluetooth compared to using the Wi-Fi receiver. I would not recommend anyone using bluetooth with this on a Mac, perhaps on a PC you may have better results.", "Wow the TBP510 Wireless Headset is great for so many reasons, where should I start? I can wear these for hours and my ears feel comfortable and don'teven get that hot. They kind of fit over my ears, and it first I kept read justing them, but then I just let it alone and everything felt fine! So far I have used this with my XBOX, PS3, iPhone and iPAD, and have had no problem with it at all. Battery life is excellent, and it charges relatively quickly.....which brings me to my one annoyance. At this price level, there should be an AC adapter, too. I'm not a fan of USB charging....but this is so good that I still  leave it at 5 stars. Sounds quality is very good. Bass is a little weak for such a high end headset.Pairing is easy, I had no problems and everyone could hear me fine with no echos! It doesn't look like a high-end head set, but it feels like one. There's nothing like a good sounding headset, I have a couple....but wireless! That's a completely different experience! I love it, and while my other headsets have better bass, the wireless is hands-down a no brainer.Surround sound is good. It has nothing on my home theater, but for headsets, this is more than acceptable and offers a GREAT gaming experience if you don't have the space for a full HT or if you do not live alone. ;)I can highly recommend the XP510!", "I like to stay up late playing video games and my husband always wants me to turn down the volume on the surround sound system.  This headset is an excellent solution to this problem.  The sound is fantastic - I first tried these out with Far Cry 3, and while sneaking up to an enemy camp to try and figure out the best way to attack, I jumped out of my skin when I heard the sound of a tiger growling while it was sneaking up behind me.  I've since used these headphones with Bioshock Infinite, Crysis 3, and Tomb Raider (and I've listened to music on my iPad 2) and I continue to be very happy with the sound quality.  Voice quality online is good too, friends say I sound clear.My only downside about the headset is I had to buy a separate audio adapter to be able to connect this with my original Xbox 360, which was around $8 - no biggie, but it meant I had to wait a few days for the adapter cable to arrive.", "The XP510 is my 3rd headset. The first two are the logitech g35, and then the Triton 720+. I do like my first two and have no real complaints about them. The XP510 is nicer.I really like the abundant features, especially the bluetooth capabilities built in. I've taken several phone calls using these, and it's very convenient especially if you're in game with the volume blasting your ear drums. I don't have to worry about missing an important call.I also really like the comfort. This headset has the best feel when it's on my head. The cups are soft and the pressure from the band that holds the cups is not to tight. It stays on my head without any buildup to pain.I have had static a bit, right out of the doors. It has however gone away. I hope it doesn't come back, and I certainly will post an update if it happens.  This static was out of the box on my first use without charging the headset.I did have a little trouble getting setup. I did not at first realize I needed an additional cord to be able to chat on the PS4 which is the primary system i planned to use this headset for. I do own all the other current and last gen consoles and may switch between however.to repeat:YOU WILL NEED TO PURCHASE AN ADDITIONAL CORD TO USE THIS HEADSET TO CHAT ON THE PLAYSTATION 4.I'm not sure if that was listed in the product description. All i saw was compatible and felt good about thatI didn't really talk about the audio yet, so here goes.The sound/music is amazing. There is a good amount of bass in this headset as well. The first thing I did when i got it going was listen to some music. Played Metallica, then some ELO, and some other random music; yes I have a diverse interest. The point is that it all sounded great. I could easily see myself listening to music on this headset if i ever needed to.Overall if you have the money to put down on this expensive hardware, I would recommend picking the xp510 up. It sounds great, feels good on your head, and offers more features than you'll likely use.There is a lot more that I didn't cover as I have not gotten to it. yeah, it's got a lot going on.", "I had my teenage son test these headphones out. He is a gamer.  His overall feedback was positive.  He loved the headphones. Compared to all the other gaming headsets he has owned this one ranked among the top three.  Below are the pros and cons.- Set-up - Was simple.- Sound - Good quality.  The volume button can be a bit sensitive, but the volume is impressive.- Wireless - Our router is located in my home office.  The wireless system was set-up in our living room - about 20 feet away - he had no problems connecting and experienced clear reception when chatting with friends.- Pre-sets - are a little complicated, but eventually you get the hang of it.- Headset - Relatively comfortable.  No major issues.  You can also use the headset as regular headphones.  The package comes with a cord so you can use them with your iphone, ipod, android, etc- Charging Cable - The charging cable is pretty long (12 feet) so you can continue to play while you are charging- Battery Life - The battery life is about 15 hours- not bad since you can charge and play if you run low on battery and need to recharge.- Price - I gave it four stars, because I think the set is a bit pricey.- Original X-box users - Please note, if you want to use an HDMI Cable with the original x-box you will need to purchase an audio adapter cable. You can get one for a couple of bucks here on Amazon.", "Make no bones about it, the Turtle Beach XP510 has set the bar quite high. I have very little to complain about in regards to it but even then, this headset gets nothing less than five stars from me.Everything you will possibly need to connect this is included in the box. Connecting it took me not even a minute's time.For starters, they sound absolutely terrific. I tested them out with several different games on my Xbox 360, namely Mass Effect 3, Dead Space 3 and for the most part, Halo 4.The bass response is pretty deep and in terms of directional sound, you'll be able to tell exactly where your foes are coming from and where all the action is happening. They're incredibly clear and you'll be able to hear every single subtle nuance in the game, which is really cool with games like the Dead Space series for instance, which all have phenomenal sound design. Playing Halo 4, I felt like I was able to pinpoint anything and everything and get the jump on people who thought they had me at their mercy. There's even a setting to amplify footsteps, which gives you a big leg up on the competition. There are a whole bunch of different sound fields you can access at the touch of a button that adjust either your general sound settings or your chat settings and finding one that's perfect for you should be a cinch. You can even connect to your computer and download all new sound fields as well for more customization options. All coupled with a pleasant female voice to let you know what settings you're on as you cycle through them.The max volume is simply loud enough. I bring it up because I know several people were concerned about the installed volume limiter but really, any louder would damage your hearing and no game is worth that. I sincerely doubt that anyone will be disappointed by the volume here.Bluetooth connectivity is offered and I mean, think about this: How cool is it that you can play your game and take a phone call with it if someone decides to give you a ring? Seriously, this function, simple as it may be in concept, is awesome. Pairing it to your phone is easy and you'll really appreciate it once you put it in use.I haven't had any snap, crackle and pops with this headset either. The X41's suffered from this but with the XP510, I've had no such issues. The only time it occurred was when my son sat next to me with an iPad running on a Wi-Fi connection to my router and as he was loading up Netflix movies, I would get some interference. Once he moved away however, the interference disappeared altogether.The headset itself is very comfy and this is coming from someone with a big noggin. The build quality is pretty sturdy and it's one of those products where once you actually hold them, you'll know you're holding a quality product. The X41's (and even the X42's) felt somewhat flimsy to me in comparison to these.The only recurring problem I had with the headset was in regards to the Bluetooth adapter that you plug into the controller. When it's connected, it works just fine. It's also pretty cool to have a wireless headset that doesn't require a cable running from the headset to the controller for chat purposes, like the X41's for instance. Once you pair the adapter to the headset via Bluetooth, it's all fine and good. The only problem is, I found myself on many occasions either accidentally disconnecting the adapter from the controller or unwittingly turning it off due to the location of the power button. I felt like the connection on the adapter wasn't really solid and more often than not, I found myself in conversation with no one until I looked down at the adapter and realized that the thing had been shut off or I had unplugged it. The power/pairing button is on the bottom of the adapter and if you happen to say, rest the controller against your leg or your stomach, it's a potential moment for you to turn it off. Thankfully, there is an included cable if you want to hardwire the headset to the controller but it winds up being a minor annoyance.I guess that the learning curve on the headphones should be noted as well. The headset has quite a few buttons on it and it took me a while before I could operate it solely by touch. There are quite a few functions to get used to with the headset so it pays to get familiar with it.I didn't even mention the rechargeable battery. You get quite a bit of juice once you've fully charged these things and it gives you an audio notification to let you know when you're running low. So good to not have to scramble for a fresh pair of batteries when they dry up, let me tell you. The only potential problem with this is that the battery is built into the headset, so a potential shipping to Turtle Beach to get a new battery may be in your future, depending on its life cycle.I genuinely feel that this headset is the absolute best gaming headset I've used yet and I've used a bunch. Please leave a comment if you have any more questions in regards to the product but I'll tell you upfront that they get a full and absolute recommendation from me. My X41's served me well but the XP510's are an absolutely worthy successor.", "Ever since I got into gaming, I have been a headset junkie. When you spent most of your PC gaming time playing co-operative games that require VOIP, it just seemed to work better for me than to rely on speakers and a standalone mic. As such, I've gone through more headsets than I could probably describe. Some have been awesome, others not so much. Since I've used and reviews plenty headsets in my time, I've kind of come up with a guideline for reviewing. When I use a headset, I grade it by four things: comfort, sound quality, mic quality and durability. I'm not really used to using headsets with my consoles (except for the mic/headset for my Xbox 360 when playing multiplayer games).  I didn't know how I would like using a console headset when I have 5.1 surround in my room already.  But let's get into the specifics.In terms of comfort, this was easily the most comfortable headset I've used in awhile. I have a large head and a lot of times headsets can give me a headache when first using them because they scrunch my skull.  That's not the case with this headset.  It fits comfortably and will be even more comfortable as time goes by.The sound quality is fantastic. The psuedo surround sound sounds good, though it can't compete to my receiver.  But it does a great job of balancing talking with game sounds, so that I'm never constantly changing settings (of which there are 8 presets).  It's very nice and sounds great.Durability is another area that's important, especially when you're spending over $250 on a headset. The XP510 is very durable. I like the way the mic works and bends.  It's also detachable.Mic quality is also very important to me because I use it to communicate constantly with my friends who are spread out across the nation. Mic quality is also something very hard to review. No one complains when I talk and it pairs well with my cellphone and no one complains with that sound either.Pairing the headset with everything worked really well.  It has about 15 hours of battery life.  If you're looking to spend in the neighborhood of $250, then this is a great choice in headset.", "This headset is amazing and gets a VERY high recommendation.  I have tried a number of different headsets over the years and this one tops them all without question.  The sound quality never suffers as a result of poor wireless connectivity as with some other headsets.  The sound is ALWAYS crystal clear and I have yet to hear even one dropout or distorted glitch.  The sound quality delivered by the XP510 is also the best I have heard from a gaming headset and also earns perfect marks.  The low end is strong and the mids and highs are nicely balanced.Setup is extremely simple and will cause you absolutely no problems.  Another great thing is that the headset uses a rechargeable battery instead of consuming tons of AA or AAA batteries like others.  This will really add up over time and will make up for a decent bit of the extra expense of this unit.  These headsets also have Bluetooth, so you can connect them to your phone and use them as a phone headset if you choose.Bottom line: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED5/5 stars", "I absolutely love this Turtle Beach Headset.Uses- I use it for strictly for the PS3 but it's nice knowing that it can be used with the Xbox or with my cell phone if I desire.  Being able to answer calls to my cell phone while playing is awesome.  I can also use it on my iPad or other tablets and it can also be used while watching movies on my PS3.  I think ti's great that there are so many different things that you can do with just this one headset.Comfort- I think this headset if very comfortable and that's saying a lot for me.  I'm sure my head is a little larger than average as well as my ears and I find this headset to be very comfortable.  I get headaches very easily, especially with over the head headsets.  They typically squeeze my head a bit too tight that causes headaches within 30 minutes or so of usage.  I can use this particular headset for hours before my head starts hurting.  They're not as tight as other headsets that I've used including other Turtle Beach headsets.Sound- The surround sound is incredible with this headset which is very important in the gaming world.  Especially the shooter games that I like to play.  I can hear people all over the map and know when they're getting close and from what direction they're coming from.Setup- Setup was very easy for me.  I was up and running in just a few minutes.  The Quick Start Guide is easy to follow and should answer any questions you may have.Headset Stand- One of the best new features to me is the fact that there's a headset stand attached to the top of the base unit.  I never really had a place to set my headset before so it was usually just laying on top of my dresser.  This feature helps me out greatly.  I love it.Wireless- I love having a wireless headset.  Not sure I could go back to playing a wire after playing wirelessly for the past couple years.  I love having this feature.Charging- If I had anything to complain about this would be it.  Although you have an incredibly long cord that allows you to charge your headset while playing, I would LOVE to have a wall charger.  I'm sick of having to charge everything by USB these days.  I would love to be able to just plug it into the wall at the end of the night and it be ready to go the next day.Battery Life- Luckily the battery life is incredibly good with these headsets.  It even comes charged right out of the box.  15 hours is what the box states and I think it's pretty accurate.  I'm very happy with the battery life.I think this headset is very easy to use and sounds incredible.  I would highly recommend it.", "First thing I'm sure you've noticed about the xp510s is the price. It's important to note that these are so much more than gaming headsets though; these are top of the line music, chat and gaming headphones.They were easy to set up and thanks to the intelligent audio control of chat I could hear both game sound and in game chat clearly regardless of the noise generated by COD black ops. The Bluetooth streaming works seamlessly and the presets are a nice touch. During gaming you will hear sounds you've never heard before - the atmospheric ambience in assassin's creed 2 is utterly stunning.Battery life seams to be what it says on the box (circa fifteen hours) and they sit extremely comfortable on your head.So whether you're listening to music, playing a game, chatting or skyping ... These cans are worth every penny.You're probably only going to buy one wireless headset - so treat yourself and get the best."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.06926402449607849, 0.14136865735054016, 0.1628606915473938, 0.00451577827334404, 0.00016627684817649424, 0.04126427322626114, 0.16088902950286865, 0.03284168615937233, 0.04399304464459419, 0.10243761539459229, 0.07710316777229309, 8.001694368431345e-05, 0.0015993937849998474, 0.005271160043776035, 8.204467303585261e-05, 7.329691288759932e-05, 0.0030207098461687565, 0.029364924877882004, 0.0002400406519882381, 0.0033071774523705244, 0.12025703489780426]]}
