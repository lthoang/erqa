I've tried headphones with distinct and balanced bass, some with great clarity but lacks the powerful low/bassy punch, and some with well-rounded sound, but forgot to incorporate a comfortable build for long sessions. Folks, the Munitio PRO40 pairs well with all types of music genres. There is no muddling or covering up of sound. The sound is precise and enjoyable.What these headphones are so good at doing -- producing studio-quality soundThese headphones intend to (and successfully) recreate and offer you sound the way that producers intended them for you to listen. On top of the many levels and dimensions of sound that isn't easily noticeable with sub $100 headphones, the Munitio PRO40 creates a harmonious left-right ear balance (stereo), as well as detecting things like reverberation, and audio mixing. What's also astonishingly good is how it's more noticeable of the echo (reverb) of the studio, or when producers intentionally create that effect when there is no echo. The small tweaks, mixdowns, changes, and many channels of a song really come alive. It's not just left right, bass, vocals. It feels like an orchestra and an open stage, where vocals, sounds, instruments, & noise can move around freely and strategically like they were supposed to. Some songs simply do not sound the same anymore compared to $150 headphones like theMonster Diesel VEKTR On-Ear Headphones with ControlTalkor $200Monster Inspiration Active Noise Canceling Over-Ear Headphones -Titanium. The sound is an absolute treat - top-notch clarity, distinct bass, full sound, & all elements of a song come and mesh well together.Here are a couple highlight songs I tested with to give you an idea of how sound quality is:Nobody - Ne-Yo-- R&B; songs tend to have a many levels of sound, instruments, vocals, and channels. Ne-yo's voice is rich and really comes to the fore front. Ne-yo's vocals blends in well with the beat, instruments, and harmonization. When say a guitar or trumpet is playing, you can actually feel Ne'yo's voice take a step back, while letting a particular beat/instrument feel full and alive. On a given beat, \"\"ah\"\" (Like drinking soda), clapping, trumpet, synthesizer all blends together precisely. There is a lot going on, and each and every element is easily distinguishable.Letters from Yokosuka - Nujabes-- The setup of the band/orchestra is felt here. It's almost like you can imagine where each person is sitting. Even with stereo headphones, it's almost like if I'm sitting in the middle of their session and can feel the dimensions and intricate details. In this song, piano, drums, saxophone, synthesizer, & xylophone all have their respective place/distance.Headphone designIt isn't flashy and certainly wouldn't garner much attention if you intended to take these outside. The design is rugged, subtlely stylish, and comfortable. Though the headphone already uses polymer, aluminum, rubbber, and leather earpads, I think it could use some nicer finishes. A matte, semi-glossy, or aluminum finish would have just been a cherry on top.The Munitio PRO40 produces distinct & precise lows/bass, clear & balanced mids, and clean highs. What makes this headphone just about perfect is that it's comfortable and built to last. The quality of sound alone is enough to warrant at least a $200 price tag. Factor in the studio sound quality, headphone build, inline mic, two-year warranty, the price is reasonable, if it suits your musical needs.A worthy debut. Munitio has done a good job designing & creating a solid, well-rounded pair of headphones. Seriously consider these on your headphone search.\"", "\"These are very nice headphones with great sound quality and build quality.  But they also offer a distinctive sound profile that would be preferred by some and might not be by others.I compared these to my AKG 601s which have a very different sound profile.  The AKGs are hard to drive, very trebly, and also very \"\"airy\"\" as they let in much of the surrounding sound.  The Munitio's are almost the polar opposite.  They are very easy to drive (my iPhone worked very well with them), very \"\"thick\"\" and bassy, and are a closed design, meaning they let in much less ambient sound and therefore feel much more like in-ear headphones.The best way to describe the difference is that with the AKGs I focused on the snare drum, with the Munitio's I was more focused on the bass guitar.  Both offer excellent sound reproduction but also very different experiences. They are clearly designed for different audiences and only the buyer knows which is the kind of experience they are looking for.Additional info about the Munitios.They include a molded neoprene case and carabiner clip.The cord is detachable via a standard jack.Cord includes a mini-remote and mic for taking calls or for use while gaming.Cord is covered in a shoelace like mesh making microphonics almost non-existent.  Jacks are made of machined aluminum.Cord length is average length for normal in-ear set.  (My AKG cable is much longer as it is designed for in home and not mobile listening).Does not include any kind of jack converter for use with a home stereo.  Typical straight mini-jack connection.Pad on top of headband is rubber, which for me starts to becomes aggravating after a while as it feels like it is pulling on my hair. (Pretty much my only real gripe with this set as the rest is simply personal preference.)\"", "I am new to the world of High Performance Headphones. I am the person who goes and buys five sets of $1 earbuds from the dollar store and uses them for a week and loses them. I've always been happy with them. So.. I've always been skeptical of people who spend hundreds of dollars on something as silly as headphones. But.. Whoah! My world has just been rocked.I was offered these headphones through the Vine Program and I was skeptical to say the least. Headphones are headphones. So, I opened them up. Wow.. kinda flashy with the 24k gold trim! Very smart looking. They looked like something a dj would wear. I simply plugged them into my ipod. That was easy. I placed them on my head and they were very easily adjustable. And wow... they were comfortable. Much lighted than I expected and much better than sticking those earbuds in my ear canal. And then I turned on my ipod.*cue the angels and harp music* Magic! I never knew what I missing before! The sound is clear and crisp. The bass is in one word.. Booming. I am incredibly impressed with these headphones. The outside sounds of my home (dogs, kids, tvs...husbands...) vanished. I had no clue this type of headphone experience even existed. I am in LOVE. I've only had them a few hours and I haven't taken them off my head yet... I've listened to music, a tv show and an audio book and all were a completely different experience than before. No more dollar store heaphones for me. I am sure most reviews of this product will be from real audiophiles.. people who are seriously into their tech and music equipment. But I'm just a regular mom, who had no idea what I was missing before. I can't compare them to any other high performance headphones, but all I know is.. these are amazing!", "\"These headphones billed themselves as \"\"For the Audiophile.\"\"  So I'm going to break these down in two ways -- one for the normal person who's looking for a great set of headphones, and the other against their Audiophile-level competition, the Bowers & Wilkins P5s which come in at roughly the same price point ($323 at the time of this review).Bowers & Wilkins P5 Mobile HiFi Stereo HeadphonesIMPORTANT:  All headphones require some level of \"\"burn-in\"\" (a break in period, essentially), but I found it critical to this set.  Out of the box, they sounded flat and disappointing.  After driving them for a bit, they warmed up nicely and improved immensely.  It's the most noticeable burn-in I've ever experienced -- and I own a LOT of headphones (like I said -- audiophile).BUILD QUALITY (5/5):  I absolutely love the build quality on these cans.  Most parts are machined aluminum, including the microphone control button.  The connectors at the end of the cord are knurled aluminum and the headphones themselves have a bit of 'heft.'  These things look like they can take a beating and handle it, something I wish more technology did. I also love the hardshell case they came in.  They do have a plastic band across the top, but that seems all well and good.  Plus, the look pretty kickin' rad.  They also surpass the P5s in this category.COMFORT (4/5): First and foremost, they actually fit well with my glasses on; something I've come to never expect from over-ear headphones.  For the most part, they are physically comfortable for prolonged wear.  If you're walking around on a hot day, your ears can get hot since the isolation factor doesn't afford ventilation.  The P5's over-ear design is more comfortable and doesn't make your ears hot.  That might just be the strangest 'negative' I've ever written on Amazon...NOISE-ISOLATING(5/5): These don't provide 'true' noise isolation like you get closer to with the P5s, but I actually quite like that about them.  You can still faintly hear surrounding noise (a car passing on the street next to you for instance), but I feel that the 'phones provide a nice balance between 'true' isolation and allowing too much din into your noggin.  If you're looking for 'true' noise isolation, these won't deliver.  If you hope to not get murdered by a bus on the street, perfecto.SOUND (3/5):For the regular person, these drive on the low end of the spectrum and deliver some serious bass.  Surprisingly, they have quite a bit of precision in the highs as well.  The mids fall off a bit, but if you're listening to something like dubstep, techno, or hip hop, it's totally acceptable.  Indeed, they handle all kinds of music pretty well, but they sure do love them some bass.Relative to the P5s, they fall flat.  They lack the true audiophile-level precision.  In the P5s, you can hear someone breathe when they play their cello.  You can hear the page turn or the pedal press when playing a piano.  They have depth.  You can close your eyes and join the performance.  These PRO40s simply do not bring the depth you can get out of their audiophile competitors.  To that end, the P5s offer much more balance, but won't hit nearly as hard as these will in the bass range.Prolonged listening also tends to cause something called ear fatigue.  That's the feeling when you just need to take off your headphones and give your ears a rest for a minute.  Your ears may even feel a bit tingly or itchy.  Now that we got that definition out of the way, it's noticeable after about an hour of listening with the PRO40s -- and I hate it.  If you're prone to ear fatigue (or don't want to find out), these may not be the best option for you.CONCLUSION\"\"Regular\"\" User: These are durable, awesome-looking, headphones that can drive bass like woah.  Like.  Woah.  If this suits your musical taste and/or you want a pair of durable headphones, these deliver.  I really like them and would definitely recommend them!Audiophile User: These cannot hold up to their competition.  They don't have the depth and clarity one would expect out of their equipment.  They sound nice, but they noticeably lack the 'extra' that pushes things into the next level (and beyond) of performance.  Munitio spent their money on build quality over audio quality, which is justified in its own way.  The P5s blow these away in the sound dept.  Go with those.I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review.\"", "\"Designed for portable applications AND home use, the Munitio PRO40's deliver the goods and in many cases better than their similarly priced competition. They are substantial, easy to drive and feature TONS of bass. The mids have presence and the highs shine but are not grating or overly strident.  I imagine they will continue to improve over a good 100 hour or so burn in period. Out of the box they sounded better than many cans I have tried and/or owned over the years. To be straight, these are NOT audiophile quality but for most real world applications they will please and delight most listeners.The key feature here is B A S S !! If you do not enjoy slightly over-hyped Bass response, then these are not for you. However, if you are always complaining about your headphones being too anemic in the Bass department then the Munitio PRO40's may be just what you are needing!I own quite a few pairs of higher end headphones. Nothing in the $1000 over over range, but cans ranging between $300 to $900 bucks.  Certain headphones, for certain types of music, etc.  I only own one pair so far that is good for ALL types and that would be my Hi Fi Man HD-500's.  The cans I already owned that come closest in price to these  Munitio's would be the Grado 325is.  Basically these beat the Grados in just about every way.Overall build quality is very good. These are well made and solid cans. The cable snaps into place and is very short, terminating in a 3.5mm mini plug. No adapter was provided.  The case is a soft/hard shell sort of zipped bag affair. It is well made, small and easy to use. I think it will last awhile too and stand up to repeated openings/closings.  The Munitios PRO 40's look great and scream quality. I didn't find the gold trim to be garish or unsightly in any way. On the whole, they feel much more solid than both my Grado's and my Sony 1840's.If you plan to use these for anything other than portable players or tablets, you will need to invest in both an extension cable and a 1/4 inch adapter. I was a bit surprised there was no adapter included.Let's talk about comfort. The Munitios have a good solid fit but seem to skimp just a bit in headband padding. The earcups/pads are a different story and are very comfortable and  feature a useful over the ear design. Noise from the outside world is tamed and you get a major perceived bump in the lower frequencies as a result.The \"\"R\"\" and \"\"L\"\" designation is inside the sidepieces although the cable extends from the left side and that is easy to remember without having to hunt for which side is which.I listened for 2 plus hours and never felt uncomfortable from the earpads.  Without some modification, the Grado's can be fairly tortuous to wear for extended periods.About the voicing of these cans: The Munitio PRO40's reflect current tastes in slightly exaggerated bass response. If the bass wasn't so up front, the rest of the frequencies would shine a bit more I think. Imaging was very good for close back cans and the sound stage was wider than I had anticipated.Bass-heads will LOVE these cans. I found I had to go into my control panel and cut the lows just a bit or the boominess totally overpowered many of my test tracks.  I listened to a number of 24/96 files, regular 16 bit FLAC and mp3's with varying bit rates. 60's pop and rock sounded very good. Classical was revealing and classic Van Halen type rock shook the foundation of my dental work. Modern Rock and Hip Hop/Rap is where these cans will be able to show their stuff.They also perform quite well with TV/Movie soundtracks. I tried the latest Die Hard film and my brain was rattling in my skull.  Music, Dialogue and Effects all equally sounded good. These are great cans for films.  If you need to watch silently, these won't let you down. Video games will also show off the massive bass these things produce.These PRO40's can really take a lot of volume before distortion creeps in. More volume than my poor ears can handle so basically I never heard ANY distortion while listening that wasn't already on the recording.I heard everything I was expecting but at times still thought the low end was just a bit too exaggerated for my personal tastes. Others will fall to the floor exclaiming \"\"I'm not worthy, I'm not worthy\"\" !!  Basically, it is a matter of personal taste. If bass that just goes forever is what you want and need, the Munitio's will give it to you.  Since it is always a tradeoff, the mids and highs suffer just a bit as a result. That distinction may blur over time and with proper burn in. The only place where the Grado's seemingly outperform the Munitio's is in the mid-range.  And even that is subject to personal taste.The Munitio PRO 40's are a very cost effective way to improve your overall system.  For listening on the go, or at home.. For PC or tablet, iPod or your TVs' headphone jack, you can find many ways to get the most from your money here.A two year warranty inspires confidence and blows away those 90 day \"\"cash and carry\"\" warranties that are standard with most brands.Nice looking, well made and priced fairly, these PRO 40's are going to give many current brands a real run for their (and YOUR) money.\"", "\"The majority of the headphones I use on a regular basis are active noise canceling (ANC) headphones. These come with the advantage of eliminating low-frequency noise so that the listener does not need to crank the volume to hear, but the disadvantage is that the phones twiddle the sound in subtle ways (usually in the bass range to boost volume but they also tend to flatten the highs) such that dedicated audiophiles can really tell the difference. The Munitio PRO40 headphones are my first higher-quality non-ANC headphones. Though I have not had them very long, I already can say I am pleased with them.These are very lightweight phones and are very well constructed. They are sturdy yet very light relative to their size. Other headphones of their approximate size can get a little heavy over longer periods of time but so far I have not had that problem with these phones. I will say that when I first put them on they were a little tight and they felt a little uncomfortable. It does not take long to adjust to these phones, though, and after only a few minutes I found them to be very comfortable. The pads are soft enough to make wearing for long periods possible.For headphones in this price range, sound is absolutely the most important consideration. There is no point in spending this kind of money if the sound quality is flat or hollow. These phones have very good sound and are worth their asking price in that regard. The bass is definitely there (and Munitio makes it a point to tout their bass response) and is deep and rich. The midrange is also very strong which is important - many headphones I have used get the highs and lows right but the midrange tends to be flat and lifeless. The highs are bright and clear. Unlike ANC phones, the sound is untouched and is an accurate reproduction from the source. Overall, the sound is very full and rich across the spectrum.I chose a set of music tracks for testing that I believed would put these phones through a fairly comprehensive listening test, selecting some club tracks, some hard metal, bluegrass and even some choral accapella. As I listened to these tracks, I was startled by just how much more music is there; these phones definitely bring out more detail in the individual tracks, to the point that a few of the tracks sounded like new versions of old favorites. Individual instruments were more distinct to such a degree that I could hear subtle ticks and plucks that I never before heard in these tracks. Music is definitely more spacial as well.These phones are fine for listening to music through a device like an MP3 player but this is not where they shine most. These are studio-grade phones and are perfect for using with a sound mixing board. I plugged these phones into a mixer used for live recording and was very, very pleased with the sound reaching my ears - what comes through the cans is untouched via internal electronics and is a fairly accurate representation of the sound as it is meant to be heard. Precision is important when recording live and these phones do a great job of reproducing the sound accurately. From here forward, these are the headphones I will used with the sound board.I cranked up the volume and was unable to get these phones to distort. I did get my ears to ring, though...I was a little surprised to find that there are no adapters in the package at all - no 1/4\"\" jack and no airplane jack. Considering that the best use of these phones is paired with a mixing board and these almost always require a 1/4\"\" plug, this is an unfortunate omission. An adapter is only a couple of dollars, though, so this is not a big deal in the grand scheme of things.The storage case for these phones is great - period. It is very crush-resistant, roomy and should provide excellent protection for the phones under normal to heavy use.These are studio-grade headphones and are far and away better than most headphones I have used. The price is definitely high, but these phones are worth the asking price and will please all but the most critical music lover. For someone working in a studio or with higher-end audio equipment, these are absolutely worth a close look.\"", "Munitio definitely knows how to make great headphones ,PRO40  fabulously transduce the  music that reaches my ears, middle, treble and bass come together to provide a clean, harmonious  sound  with high quality bass ,comfortable, stylish and made with good materials......they are great", "\"After making a well-made attractive 9mm-round shaped earbud that got poor reviews for actual sound quality, Munitio has decided to try their collective hand at a full-sized closed headphone using premium materials, and priced to go head to head with the omnipresent Dre Beats and VModa. They generally succeeded in their goals, and the Pro 40 also ended up sounding better than the Beats and VModas as well. More importantly, the Pros also end up being better made than the Beats and also have enough clever and original styling cues to stand out from a crowded field. I'll discuss my opinion of the Pro 40s and then compare them to a few other headphones in the same price range, along with a less expensive and more expensive competitor.Styling and Materials: Munitio targeted the VModa M80 here, aiming for a sturdy non-jointed frame made from quality industrial style materials. Unlike the M80s though, the Pro 40s are designed to accommodate those with bigger than average heads. My own largish noggin could barely fit in the M80 frame at maximum extension, but I was able to comfortably accommodate the Pro 40s on click 8 of 10. The downside to the larger frame is that the non-folding design makes the Pro40s slightly bulkier than the M80s. These are still tiny compared to full size headphones like say the Yamaha Pro series. Munitio gives the owner a nice hard clam shell case, that is sturdy and well made, but also larger than the similar VModa clamshell. The lack of foldability is probably a good thing, as all the great long term headphones like the Sennheiser HD25 avoid joints, as the joint inevitably become creaky over time which makes the headphones annoying to use especially with quieter music.The Pro 40s use a detachable cable plugged into the left earpiece, and the single cable provided by Munitio with the Pro 40s is a \"\"nylon shoelace\"\" style fabric cable very similar to that offered by VModa. Oddly at this price point, Munitio only gives you a single cable. Most competitors (VModa, Sennheiser, Sony, Yamaha, B&W;) give you two cables at this price level, sometimes of varying lengths and / or designs. What you get from Munitio is good enough, but an extra cable would have been welcome. Of note is that the volume and playback control buttons on the cable are less well articulated than on say Sony or Yamaha phones, so you occasionally can't find the pause/play button, or press volume up when you wanted volume down, etc.Aesthetics are well done, black and grey with some gold highlighting. The phones are not exactly startling (like say the Sony X Factor phones are) but this is probably a good thing for most users. I like the fact that Munitio did not try and shamelessly copy the Beats as some lower end and even higher end (cough, cough, Yamaha!) did in their own designs. I thought these headphones were tasteful and attractive, suggesting their price point fairly. At the same time, the B&W; P5 looks pricier, as its design is more distinctive and uses all metal and leather. Munitio has some plastic and pleather in there, though the use of those materials at least is not painfully obvious.Isolation and Comfort: The Pro 40s are closed phones, which attenuates a lot of outside noise. They are also circumaural, meaning they are meant to completely enclose the ears. Unlike the Sennheiser Momentums, the Munitios actually live up to their intended fit and completely encircle my ears. Wearing comfort is excellent, better than any supraaural model (which fit on top of the ear), and there is enough space in the cup to avoid irritating the ear over time. I wore these for 2-3 hours on numerous occasions and did not have any ear pain or discomfort. However, the pleather used for the cups, though comfy, is immensely hot, more so than even the ear-baking ATH M50s. On a hot summer day, the Pro 40s become unbearably hot after as little as 30 minutes. One expects closed design pleather headphone to be on the warm side, but the Pro 40s are immensely more so than most examples.In terms of isolation, the Pro 40s are pretty successful. These will do fine in a caf&eacute; or around the house, but might be overpowered on the subway or an airplane, especially if you are listening to \"\"peaky\"\" music, i.e. with plenty of high and low noise level dynamic contrasts. These are much better than the P5s or the M80s, slightly better than the Sony MDR-1Rs, and slightly worse than the M50s or Yamaha 500s. The Pro 40s grip the head with moderate tightness, and have enough room in the circular ear-cups for most users.Warranty from Munitio is covered for two years.Sound: No wrong moves here; the Pro 40s have a slight emphasis in mids and bass, and reasonably presented treble, i.e. not bright or rolled off too much. The tone picture is pleasing and balanced, though not strictly accurate in the audiophile sense. The Pro 40s do best with modern amplified music, and shine especially well with metal such as Iced Earth, Lamb of God, and The Haunted. Bassy electronic stuff like Black Dog or Massive Attack sounds fine, though the bass may not be quite enough for those who live for the thump. If you like to hear detail and clarity in your music along with very good low tones, you will enjoy these. Vocals, jazz, and classical all sound better than good, but the issue for acoustic music is soundstage. Like most closed cans, the Pro 40s have a fairly shallow and central soundstage, so the illusion of instrument placement and depth is pretty lacking. An open design headphone will give you a much more realistic and spacious placement of instruments, as will some of the better designed closed cans like the Yamaha 500 and the Sony MDR-1R. If you are a multi-genre enthusiast and mix things up a bit, the Pro 40s will be fine, but if you listen mainly to acoustic music and need a closed design, you may want to look elsewhere.The sound is forward in its presentation, and has a lot of detail and clarity. Overall sound is close to the ATH M50, with roughly the same bass emphasis as the AudioTechnicas, but with more emphasis on mids and slightly greater clarity in presentation of sound detail. If you like the M50 sound but wanted a bit more detail, you will like the Pro 40s. PRAT is exceptionally quick on the Pro Audios, probably their greatest strength and what makes them so impressive with electric guitar music and fast drums.Munitio claims they have revolutionary technologies at work in the Pro 40s including some off-axis compensation in the sound to compensate for the position and placement of the cups on your ear, along with titanium drivers. Uhm, whatever. I can't verify if any of these alleged innovations actually do anything, but I like the overall sound of the Pro 40s with or without whatever technological innovations are at work. The Pro 40 sound is not stunningly different from many other headphone's sound, but it is the equal of or better than many other models in the price range. (See comparisons below.)I found the Munitio sound to be surprisingly impressive given the company's relatively new credentials, and also a surprise (frankly) when considering the uninspired sound and over-hyped marketing of their 9mm in-ears. The Pro 40s were a nice surprise, with lots of clarity and detail, and a balance that though not technically perfect is one that most users will find appealing and enjoyable. The Pro 40s are also easily driven (103 dB sensitivity and 32 ohm impedance) so these sounded great on an Ipod and Touch Ipod and decent enough on a Samsung Gal S3. (No full size phone really sounds stunning on a Samsung. Get a canal phone if you want to be amazed by your Galaxy's sound...)Comparisons:* Versus the B&W; P5: The P5 looks nicer and uses nicer materials. They give you two cables, but only a soft carrying pouch. The P5 is smaller, has a hard time fitting bigger heads, and is supra-aural by design. The P5s sound is much more laid back and veiled sounding, and the bass emphasis is less balanced and comes at the expense of some of the middle and treble ranges. PRAT is much worse on the P5s, making the B&W; a bad choice for rock and metal, and soundstage is about the same as on the Pro 40s (i.e. mediocre), so neither of these is good for acoustic jazz or classical fans. The P5 is about as comfortable, has better air flow for less of a sauna effect, but isolates worse. All in all, if you want a conversation piece and like downtempo or smooth jazz, the P5s are a better bet, but if you listen extensively to almost any other genre, the Pro 40s are a better bet.* Versus the AKG 550: The 550s are larger phones ill-suited for portable use. Despite AKG's claims, they sound at best adequate when driven out of portable devices and really need a stereo receiver jack or amp to sound at all exceptional. The 550s have an awkwardly long non-detachable cable, and no carrying case to speak of. The 550s are comfy, and less hot to wear than the Pro 40s, but they need a minimum head size to work, as very small noggins will create an overly loose fit and correspondingly worse isolation and sound. The 550s have an \"\"audiophile\"\" sound, i.e. painstakingly accurate and will sound bass-deprived to most non-purist listeners. The 550s have a broader soundstage than the Pro40s and so in theory would be better for acoustic music, but the middling quality bass and occasionally harsh treble will not endear these cans to many, especially at the price point. The 550s might be preferable for home use by audiophiles who do not want or need any boost in mids or bass, but most listeners will prefer the Pro 40s, especially for portable use.* Versus the Sennheiser Momentum: The Momentums cost 15% more than the Munitios, and sound pretty similar to the P5s though with slightly more balanced bass and quicker PRAT. The Momies are too small for me, and I had to use them as supra- rather than circumaural, so my listening experience with these was unsatisfactory and brief. Sennheiser at least gives you nice accessories and great materials and build quality, albeit at an even more inflated price point. If you care at all about sound, listen to rock or metal frequently, and wear more than a hat size \"\"M\"\", the Pro 40s are a better choice.* Versus the Yamaha 500s: The 500s cost 33% more (!) than the Pro 40s and use higher quality materials. The design is shamelessly cribbed from the Beats, including the horrid snap out hinge on the arms which allows for (slightly) more compact storage, but the 500s huge size offsets whatever storage assets are gained by including the snap hinge. Sound is somewhat better than the Pro 40s (though not 33% better!) and the level of clarity and detail is perceptibly higher with the Yamahas. Accessories are top notch. However, the 500s are very uncomfortable to wear for more than an hour due to the bulky stiff pleather cups used and the higher clamping pressure of the frame. Though there is some noticeable differences in sound, the higher price point and worse comfort will drive most comparison shoppers to Munitio.* Versus the Sony MDR-1R: To me, the Sonys are the toughest direct competitor of Munitio. The 1Rs give you better accessories (though no hard carry case), nicer materials, and more creative aesthetics. The 1Rs are just as comfortable, and the pleather used is a lot more breathable, leading to less ear sauna effect. The Sonys are great all-around cans, offering a balanced sound that can cover all genres well. The 1Rs also have a surprisingly wide soundstage, which gives acoustic jazz and classical more of a sparkle. The 1Rs are somewhat worse for metal and rock as the PRAT is a tad slower, and they also isolate somewhat less than the Pro 40s (though neither is wonderful in that regard.) Ultimately, rock and metal fans will like the Pro 40s more, and acoustic fans, or multi-genre listeners will tend towards the Sonys. (Also, the 1R is showing some price instability recently, so if the 1Rs get a lot cheaper than the Pro 40s, that fact will also decide many minds...)*  Versus the ATH-M50s: Selling at roughly a third of the Pro 40s price, the M50s provide more than a bit of challenge to the Pro 40s. Sound is comparable, with the Pro 40s favoring mids more and the M50s favoring bass. Isolation and comfort are about the same, with ATH offering less ear heat over time due to better quality pleather. Soundstage is roughly the same, with perhaps a minor edge to ATH. The deciding factor for most buyers will be build quality and aesthetics. The M50s use a hinge based system with multiple joints used to allow folding along two axes. The M50s end up being only slightly more portable, and have the significant liability of a lot of creaky plastic (lots) and metal (scarcer). The M50 thus ages badly and gets creaky over time, though it is still very sturdy and is listenable even three years down the road, if you get it in the right position and keep your head still. Equally problematic is the ugly generic build quality that makes the M50 look just like every other $100 studio phone out there. Munitio offers a sturdier and more attractive build, along with higher quality materials, a longer warranty, and a more appealing sound for metalheads. Each purchaser can decide for themselves what price point and feature set meets their needs better.Conclusion: How could the Pro 40s have gotten five stars from me? A second cord, better pleather, and a broader soundstage would have clinched the deal. Most other closed phones have the same narrow soundstage, so that is not too big a problem (though see the Sony comparison above), and the second cord is no big deal. The sweaty pleather feels out of place on such an expensive headphone though, especially when every comparison model above does better at the same or lower cost. Rock and metal fans now have a solid VModa M80 alternative (and one that gets vocals much better!), and Munitio is shaping up to be a strong contender in the modern luxury portable headphone field.\""], "Gamma": [0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.03215679153800011, 0.045315660536289215, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.04532724618911743, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.01681215688586235, 0.04450364410877228, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675, 0.04532724618911743, 0.045326899737119675, 0.045326899737119675], "Beta": [[0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.024678274989128113, 0.011392357759177685, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444209091365337, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058615934103727], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.024678926914930344, 0.011392095126211643, 0.00811067596077919, 0.00054444425040856, 0.5819180607795715, 0.008173376321792603, 0.3646765649318695, 0.0005058866227045655], [0.025008946657180786, 0.011941271834075451, 0.008547775447368622, 0.000577429193072021, 0.5820147395133972, 0.008304623886942863, 0.3630690574645996, 0.0005362248630262911], [0.024682749062776566, 0.0113906878978014, 0.008111681789159775, 0.0005445281858555973, 0.5819140076637268, 0.008175763301551342, 0.36467453837394714, 0.0005060427938587964], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828243970871, 0.011392352171242237, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.581919252872467, 0.00817297212779522, 0.36467626690864563, 0.0005058606038801372], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.028493136167526245, 0.0057201809249818325, 0.012635215185582638, 0.00016693548241164535, 0.6227926015853882, 0.013068467378616333, 0.3163251578807831, 0.0007982962415553629], [0.024690689519047737, 0.011424319818615913, 0.008133003488183022, 0.0005459974054247141, 0.5819348096847534, 0.008176593109965324, 0.3645873963832855, 0.0005072577041573822], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828430235386, 0.011392351239919662, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.008172980509698391, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058611859567463], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981], [0.02467828057706356, 0.011392354965209961, 0.00811056885868311, 0.0005444204434752464, 0.5819193124771118, 0.00817297212779522, 0.364676296710968, 0.0005058606620877981]]}
