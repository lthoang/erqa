That's not what this does, so I couldn't use it.  I feel so silly.  I gave this three stars because I don't know if it is a one star product, or a five star product, so I gave it the average of three stars.", "I ordered this thinking it was for something else and then I saw it was something that I don't ordinarily use.  I found a friend of a friend who is knowledgeable about these items and she stated that it is a good device for a multi-computer presentation.  She was also complimentary about the Belkin brand.  I hope this helps.", "This device lets you plug in four devices via VGA and then see each of the device's monitors, one at a time, on a display screen or larger monitor. If you have a business or home-security use for this function, this Belkin display switch will work for you. It's solidly built and easy to use (you switch monitor displays just by pushing buttons).The unit runs with a power cord, which is kind of a pain but I'm not sure battery-powered models are available. Also, not all newer laptops have VGA connectors, so make sure your devices will work with this unit (adapters are available as separate purchases).The device is not expensive for what it provides. For what it is, it's a solid four-star unit. Just make certain you can use it (and have a use for it) before buying.", "This is not a KVM (keyboard, video, monitor switch). All this device does is allow you to switch among four different VGA inputs. Honestly I'm not fully sure the purpose of this. The marketing of it indicates it's great for a boardroom so that way four different users can share a projector. In reality though, you still need to purchase clunky VGA cables (not included), provide the device power (outlets are always at a premium), and of course have a VGA output (newer laptops often don't). Given these hassles and the four cables, plus this device, plus the power adapter, It's just easier to unplug one cord.The pricing is similar to that of a KVM, but doesn't deliver the features. One place I found a use for it was a monitor shared with multiple alarm system. With this monitor switch I could review multiple feeds by switching inputs. That was a good use case, but it's not easily portable considering you have to carry VGA cords with you.", "Courtesy of the Amazon Vine program, I have received a Belkin 4-Port Video Display Switch for review. Inside the box is the switch itself and a compact power supply unit. There are no VGA cables.To be sure this is NOT a KVM switch. It's merely a VGA multiplexer. The target usage scenario is you have a projector, say in a conference room, and you want to connect multiple VGA devices to it ahead-of-time so that you can switch among them via a button press. This happens all the time in my office meetings, for example, when each of us has to present in sequence. The amount of time saved can be enormous because that means every presenter gets to test that their computer can talk to the projector ahead-of-time and then NOT fiddle with unpluging and plugging. (If you have used PowerPoint enough, you may have run into situations where it just gets confused.)The switch is solidly constructed, and the power supply unit is compact. If your application demands it, then this is a very solid choice. The only cons I can identify is that this is VGA only. However, since VGA is likely going to stay for a very long time, this is really minor. 5/5.", "This device is very handy for anyone who wants to connect 2 or more computers to a single monitor.  This is not a KVM switch so each computer will need its own keyboard and mouse.  Its pretty simple to setup... all you need to do is plug in your monitor to the video out and then connect your computers to the switch.  The downside to the switch is that it does require a power source and there is not power switch switch to allow you to turn it off when not in use.  The unit does not come with a video cable so you will need to ensure that you have an extra video cable for each of the computers you wish to connect.Also worth noting is that on the unit that I received the #4 button was jammed.  It still functioned while jammed but it just did not give any tactile feedback to let you know the button was pressed.  Fortunately I was able to pry out the button and now it functions correctly.*** Pros: ****- East to setup- Backlit Buttons- Durable construction*** Cons: ***- No included VGA cable- No power switch so it is always on even if your computer is off- Poor quality control on the unit I received (jammed #4 button)", "I don't &#34;love it&#34;, per se, but it does what it says it does and does it well.This hooks up four VGA sources to a single monitor. You can view each source by pressing the corresponding button. This is a very simple device; there is no autosensing or magic going on. Just a switch.It takes a second or so to switch from one source to the next. I see no degradation of picture quality or artifacts in video. The button corresponding to the source being displayed is lit.Note: It doesn't switch the mouse and keyboard, just the monitor, so be sure you have a situation where that works for you. For example I have a laptop that I dock to the same monitor as my desktop computer. Since the laptop has its own mouse and keyboard, this allows me to use my desktop monitor as a second monitor for my laptop. If you need to switch a mouse and keyboard too, you need a KVM switch.", "This Belkin 4-Port Video Display Switch is a great addition to any techie's collection. It's super easy to install and use and allows you to display up to four devices at once. It works just like promised, it's well made, and it's easy to use - it doesn't get better than that.", "This is not a KVM but it is similar to it. As others noted, this can be great for conference rooms. But I also found it useful for my set up where I was using an actual KVM but not using its keyboard/mouse ports because I use synergy between my Linux and Windows machines with a single keyboard+mouse but multiple monitors. I could switch the video feed on my larger monitor between the two systems when needed.It works as designed. Although if I were to buy of these, I would go with either a DVI or a Display Port switch as VGA is outdated. It is still great for presentations.", "Allows up to four computers to hook up to a single monitor/projection.  It is lightweight, yet well-constructed.  Works well with two computers in series, I personally have never had the need for four. However, very nice for when presenters have their own laptops.  Perhaps a little obsolete with thumb drives being so portable and having so much storage, but some presenters like to have their powerpoint of their computer so that there is no conflict with different versions of windows or other software.  This is perfect for those people!", "It works perfectly with two monitors hooked up. I do not have more than 2 VGA monitors at this time to try it with but it is working fine with two. If things change I will return and revise my review but so far so good; it works as advertised.", "The Belkin 4-Port Video Display Switch is easy to set up and use. You can hook the output from four separate computers into it and view them one at a time on a single monitor. There are four VGA cable inputs on the back and one VGA output. You switch inputs using the buttons on top numbered 1-4.This is just a switching device. It does not come with any monitors, or cables, just the AC power adapter.This device turned out to be exactly what I needed at a meeting. There were errors being made by some people entering info into a database. I hooked up two computers, sending the video out to the Switch device into 2 different channels and connected a large monitor to the output (these ports are all on the back of the device).I was able to take one computer where the database was entered correctly and one where it was not and switch back and forth between the two so everyone could see the differences. It allowed me to quickly and easily show where the errors were, how to correct them and what the database should look like when information was entered correctly. Being able to show the group the problems and answer questions helped those who were unsure about things to be fully informed.I like Belkin products and own quite a few of them. The Belkin 4-Port Video Display Switch is another device by them that I am pleased with. It sets up quickly and simply, is easy to use, and has a nice appearance.I found this Switch to be very useful and will continue to use it in the future.Very good product.", "I have an older 2nd computer that I sometimes need to use because it has older software that has not been updated to the newer system that I use on the current computer. The monitor has an optional VGA port and so does the older computer (I use the 2nd port of the newer computer with a VGA adapter cable when I want to use this monitor). So I can use the Belkin to switch between the 2 computers instead of unplugging. Videos are not degraded when routed through this switcher.Set up was quick and easy. The VGA connectors are solid and the screws went right into their sockets. I couldn&#8217;t be happier. If you have a Mac, know that I tested that situation and it will work on your computer if you have a VGA port.", "This device allows you to set up several presenters ahead of time so that when the time comes for each presenter to start, you don't have to unplug the previous person in order to plug in the next one.  Sometimes, I need to show presentations from two computers switching between them without letting the audience seeing you switch between programs.The only problem is VGA connections are on its way out.  I don't know how long this device will continue to be useful.  Of course most projectors are still using VGA and not every conference room is upgrading their projector so soon.The device is also compact and you can carry with you if you know that you will be sharing the projector with other people.", "If you have a need for this unit, it works.  Plugged in both my laptop and my desktop, and this switched quickly between the two on my monitor.  Does what it says it will do.", "The switch works as advertised, it is plug and play, but it serves no useful purpose for me.When I ordered this product, I was under the impression that I ordered a four-port KVM switch, which can control up to four computers sharing a single display monitor and a single keyboard and mouse.  It turns out that this is not a KVM switch.  This misconception is clearly my fault, even though I must say that it never occurred to me that somebody might make a new product to control four computers with four separate keyboards and four mice sharing a single display unit.  This display switch is a total oxymoron at home or at home office, but if that suits your needs, check it out.  If you do so, please picture your desktop with a single monitor but cluttered with four keyboards and four mice.  There may be a place for this device, but it is not at home but in a small business conference room, where four people sit around a table, each with his own laptop connected to this device, which then controls a projector unit which displays the images on a large conference room screen.If you seek to control multiple home computers sharing a single display a single keyboard and a single mouse, forget this product and buy yourself a KVM switch.  Amazon sells many different brands.  Just type &#34;KVM switch&#34; in the search box in computers and you will see the available merchandise, several of which are actually cheaper than this product, despite the fact they are KVM switches and they are far more capable than a mere display switch.", "The Belkin 4-Port Switch works well and is easy to set up. There's not a whole lot to say about it, other than that it does exactly what it's supposed to.The only reason I'm giving it 4.5 stars is because it's VGA only, which isn't a problem in itself (though the format is becoming outmoded...), but that feature isn't denoted in the product title. This may seem like a nitpick, but in candor, I've lost count of the number of people I personally know who have made tech purchases that didn't satisfy their needs because they weren't tech-savvy enough to know what they were looking for. In this age of tech-saturation, I am of the opinion that manufacturers should do everything in their power to provide consumers with as much information about their products as they possibly can. Calling this a '4-Port VGA Display Switch' would have been better, and at least caused the non-savvy prospective buyers to ask 'what is VGA?'Nonetheless, the product works and that's the most important thing. 4.5 stars.", "This 4 Port video display switch is perfect for anyone who is tired of unplugging and replugging cables.  The simply switch allows you to quickly alternate between multiple screens for your computer.  I love the ability to work on my desktop, but then to put logos and graphics on the tv hanging on the wall during a meeting.  Seems like a great purchase for the price point, and hasn't caused me any problems yet.", "This little item is extremely helpful if you frequently need to switch between multiple inputs for your monitor.  It seems like each of my clients wants me to use their own laptop for work, so I hook them all up through this to a monitor and then I can easily switch between them to the one I want to use.  Set-up was easy even if you aren't an IT genius.  I recommend this product.", "For some reason none of the systems connected to port 3 would display, so I think I just got a bum input.  Assuming this isn't common across others' units, it might just be an isolated problem.Video switching is pretty quick, but the switch supports VGA, obviously won't work with HDMI.  It's also JUST a video switch, not a KVM that does keyboard/mouse or any USB devices, so just be aware of that.", "Besides the obvious use in a corporate environment, this switch is useful in a household that has many gadgets to display. The fact that this is a display switch and not a KVM it's what I like about it. Why? Well, I have a few KVM switchers around, but since I started using wireless mouse/keyboard sets that are easily moved from a machine to another, I don't have much use for a device that need a wired keyboard connected (which most KVM require in order to switch screens).This display switch comes with a power supply but no VGA cables. If the device you're going to connect needs a cable this is the type of cable you should getC&E; VGA-VGA Standard 15-Pin VGA Male to VGA Male Cable 10 FTIt comes in an assortment of sizes, so one can pick according to what is needed.Of the four VGA inputs, I'm using three, I left one for when I would need to quickly plug something else (like my laptop or my netbook). I currently have two computer towers plugged into it; one is a regular desktop and the other a HTPC. Each has its own set of keyboard and mouse. While the desktop I use it by sitting behind the desk where the monitor is, the HTPC I mostly use it while sitting on a nearby couch, a few feet away; I keep its mouse/keyboard on a table next to the couch.The third device I had connected into the switch, is the one I like the most to display using it. It's my surveillance system, which I can access from many devices, both at home and outside by logging into my network. However, there is a delay of the time it takes to log into the network or to access the video feed. While having the VGA cable connected directly into the DVR provides a live image of what the cameras are capturing.With the Belkin 4-Port Video Display Switch, it's only one simple touching of a button and I can switch from what I'm working with, or from watching the news, to see what's is happening outside my door. Every device has its own resolution and the switch doesn't have a glitch while changing from one display to another in a second, the image is of excellent quality, the same as if the devices were connected directly to the monitor and so far, it has supported all the resolutions I tried with it.", "This Belkin 4-Port Video Display Switch is one of those things I didn't think I really needed... until I needed it. I wanted to push out the display of two particular laptops to a single monitor without fussing around with cable switching. That's exactly what this Belkin unit does, and it does it well.The button selection on the top is easy to work with, and there's not much you can screw up... up to four cables in, one coming out. This is a bare-bones unit, in that it's a single power supply with no real controls to worry about. It's either plugged in and on, or it's unplugged and off. Also, it's a BYOC (Bring Your Own Cable) package, so make sure you already have your VGA cables when you buy this (or order a set along with this purchase).You could spend more and get the same basic functionality, but if this is all you need, it'll work well.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0009558206074871123, 0.006114874500781298, 0.09033860266208649, 0.05546934902667999, 0.049046874046325684, 0.00046138284960761666, 0.014731749892234802, 0.011273606680333614, 0.024617979303002357, 0.10587593168020248, 0.012401587329804897, 0.0048279911279678345, 0.014933929778635502, 0.11340828239917755, 0.030196083709597588, 0.0010443867649883032, 0.003256786148995161, 0.03599194064736366, 0.15049394965171814, 0.12344429641962051, 0.0004810496757272631, 0.15063348412513733]]}
