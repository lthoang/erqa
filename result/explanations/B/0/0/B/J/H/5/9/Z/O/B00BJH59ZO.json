"], "reviews": ["If these pretzel sticks are any indication, the days of gluten free products taking a back seat are over. Delightfully crispy, these sticks have great buttery flavor and a pleasing crunch.Tthe sea salt enhances the flavor. In addition to being gluten free, these snacks contain no milk, eggs, wheat, casein, or lactose. Plus they have no genetically modified ingredients. With a combination of super taste and quality, allergen free ingredients, these pretzel sticks make a great snack for everyone. Recommended.", "The best compliment I can give these pretzel snacks is the fact that they taste like regular pretzels. The fact that they're gluten free is a bonus. They are also free of milk, casein, egg, and lactose free. I like the sea salt too. There is a tiny bit of aftertaste, not bad, but it's there. These aren't healthy (corn starch, potato starch, sugar, etc) but if you're looking for a snack that is free of certain items--this may be the one for you.", "The most anyone can want from a gluten free product is for it to not seem gluten free. These pretzels taste like pretzels. Most people won't be able to tell the difference between these and pretzels containing gluten. If you have a gluten allergy in your household, these will be a great option.", "\"I really liked these pretzels, more so than the twist version of the same brand. The thin sticks seemed to be more crunchy and less mealy in texture than the twists. The taste is excellent - just like a \"\"regular\"\" pretzel. As with the twist version, the salt content is spot on - not too much and not too little.Although I don't have a major problem eating gluten, I would certainly get these again instead of regular pretzels. The taste and perfect level of saltiness makes them a winner even if you don't need to avoid gluten in your diet.\"", "Each package of Gratify pretzel sticks contains 8 ounces which is small when compared to other brands of pretzels. They are obviously more expensive as well but that is to be expected from a gluten free product. I love pretzel sticks but wasn't sure if a gluten free pretzel would taste very good. I have tried a free other gluten free products that I haven't been very excited about. I have to admit I was very surprised but they do taste very good. Once I started to each them I just couldn't stop eating them and must have ate a third of the bag. If you put them in bowl without the packaging I doubt most people would even notice the difference. If you are on a gluten free diet and like pretzels then I would strongly suggest you give these a try because I don't think you will be disappointed.", "Gluten free products are becoming quite common nowadays and most of them that we've tried have been pretty good. I still wasn't sure as what to expect from a gluten free pretzel. Gratify pretzels are made from corn and potato starch instead of wheat flour. I can honestly say that they just taste like regular pretzels, no weird or off-putting flavor at all.What I liked best was that they were made with non-GMO ingredients. When I see corn anything as an ingredient, I'm thinking genetically modified corn but not with this brand. Also, wheat free (of course), milk free, casein free, egg free and lactose free. It' s a good snack product for anyone that may have any of those food allergies (we have milk allergies in our household) and those with celiac disease.We tried the twists and the sticks. I personally like the twists best for just snacking but the sticks are great for dips.", "I loved these pretzel they were better than pretzels with gluten. My kids also really enjoyed these. They have a great texture and I really liked the size. They also were not broken bits like some pretzels.", "I'm a big fan of pretzels. As far as pretzels go, these aren't bad. On the plus side, it's only 130 calories for 33 sticks, which is quite a generous serving size. Usually, the serving size is like 8 pretzels for a similar amount of calories. For consummate snackers, you can snack a bit with less guilt.The taste is a mixed bag. I like it. It's very buttery. But it's also pretty salty as well. I don't mind salty pretzels, but these ones maybe have a bit too much of a salty flavor. Of course, that's a matter of taste, but I thought it might help to warn anybody else who is averse to salt.Salt caveat aside, I'd recommend these.", "I am not gluten free.  Usually when I try gluten free versions of foods normally made from wheat, I find them lacking.  However, these pretzels were great.  They did taste a little different from a traditional wheat-based pretzel, but not in a bad way.  They had the slightest hint of a sourdough taste, which I really enjoyed.I also appreciated the fact that they were a crisp, yet sturdy pretzel.  I like to dip pretzels in peanut butter, cream cheese, etc., and many brands snap apart when I do that.  These were sturdy enough to pick up a dip or spread, but not so hard that they were difficult to eat.The next time I need a gluten free snack to accommodate someone's dietary restrictions, I will certainly consider these.", "I was delightfully surprised with the taste of the Gratify Gluten Free pretzel sticks. I was expecting maybe a bland taste. Not the case. These pretzels are delicious and love the sea salt. I am going to recommend these to my friend who has to eat gluten free and is also diabetic. Excellent product!!!", "My wife and I both enjoy pretzels and I was hesitant to try these gluten-free pretzels.  But they are actually tasty.  The salt is not overpowering, they are crunchy and there is a buttery taste also. We finished the bag in one sitting. I would certainly would try these again!", "Gratify's gluten free pretzels do the amazing- they don't taste gluten free. These pretzels have the traditional snap of regular pretzels. These are a little thicker than the twists but still they are crunchy and light as opposed to most gluten free snacks that are just hard. These have the traditional pretzel taste and the right mix of saltiness. Gluten free or not these are just perfect pretzels. These are so great for dipping.These will disappear quickly so buy more than you need.", "Gratify Gluten-free Pretzel Sticks are a healthy way to get your craving for snack food.  The distinct pretzel flavor allows you to enjoy guilt-free snacking.  The pretzels are baked perfectly and you can have 33 pretzel sticks per serving - how satisfying is that?", "\"I have a salad with lunch almost every day (or soup in winter)...with it, I like breadsticks but have been trying to cut back on the amount of gluten. This seemed like a nice replacement.Right off, I was a bit alarmed as it includes soy...a known GMO product. However, this claims no GMO/other so they get a point for that.Next is the size; this is a small bag so I figured it would be half empty...was pleasantly surprised to see how packed the bag was. The bag itself is nice but I wish there was a zip lock or at least a tab closure on the sides.Flavor is good. Not overly salted but well done. They used sea salt which is another added bonus. Flavor is very similar to a regular pretzel, crunch is excellent.The odd - there is a difference between these and standard pretzels...the texture. It's very odd. It sort of dissolves into nothingness and doesn't have the \"\"heft\"\" of regular pretzels...clearly due to the lack of gluten.Overall, I'd be quite inclined to purchase these again!\"", "The Gratify Gluten Free Pretzel Sticks are great appetizers.  This past Friday night, I served them with Frito Lay French Onion Dip [Frito Lay Dip, French Onion, 8.5 oz, (pack of 3)].  They are approximately two inches long and made for dipping.  They are also very low in salt.  I don't like a lot of salt in my food.  I never pick up a salt shaker.  Unless a recipe requires salt, I never use it my cooking.  Also, these kosher pretzel sticks are great for those, like me, who have food allergies.  They are wheat free, milk free, casein free, egg free, lactose free and don't have GMO ingredients.  My food allergy testing revealed that I have strong sensitivities to wheat, milk, chocolate and pork; however, I continue to consume these products in small quantities.I took these pretzel sticks, along with the French onion dip, to work, which was a big mistake.  I couldn't stop eating them.  I took them home and don't plan to ever bring them back.  They taste just like the Gratify Gluten Free Pretzel Twists [Gratify Gluten Free Pretzel Twists, 8 Ounce (Pack of 6)].  In fact, they both have the same ingredients.  If you love the taste of one, then you'll love the taste of the other.  Personally, I prefer the pretzel twists because, in my opinion, they are better for dipping and are more aesthetically appealing than straight, plain sticks.  The pretzel twists are more appropriate for covering with chocolate and yogurt.  I can't wait to try the Gratify Gluten Free Milk Chocolate Covered Twists (Gratify Milk Chocolate Covered Pretzel Twists Gluten Free -- 5.5 oz Each / Pack of 2) and the Yogurt Covered Twists (Gratify Gluten Free Pretzels Yogurt Covered Twists -- 5.5 oz Each / Pack of 2).  I'll have to remember to look for them the next time I go to my grocery store.  I wouldn't order them online this time of the year because the hot weather might melt the chocolate and the yogurt.The only thing I didn't like about this product was the bag.  It is not resealable.  Also, it is composed of a cheap, flimsy material that must be more paper than plastic (for trouble-free recycling?) and is easily torn.  Once the bag is torn, the tear will become longer and longer.  I had to place the torn remnants of the bag inside my Swissmar Pop N Go Box (Swissmar Pop N Go Collapsible Silicone Meal Box, Kiwi) to ensure that the pretzel sticks didn't accidentally spill out of the bag or became stale because of excessive exposure to air.  I recommend that the pretzel sticks be packaged within a resealable bag that has thicker, more durable walls.  I experienced this problem with both bags of Gratify Gluten Free Pretzels--the twists and the sticks.Joseph B. Hoyos", "I'm a pretzel lover from way back, and I loved the Gratify gluten free pretzel sticks. They taste great, they're just crunchy enough, the amount of sea salt is just right, and they don't break off if you use them in dips. So I have no problem giving them 5 stars for enjoyment. They're great for snacking.But you should check the ingredients to know what you're getting in the 140 calories per serving. First, one serving (33 pretzel sticks) contains 420mg of sodium, a consideration for people who are restricting their sodium intake. Second, the usual wheat flour has been replaced by potato starch. That means there is no protein and no dietary fiber. The calories come from 22 grams of carbohydrates (62% of total calories) and 6 grams of fat (38% of total calories). Diabetics and people on high protein diets may need to take that into account.But they do taste mighty good.", "\"I am not on a gluten-free diet, so I evaluated this pretzels knowing how much I like regular mini-pretzels, and trying to decide if they would be a good substitute for people who can't eat wheat.  These are pretzel sticks, not actual pretzel shapes, but made of the same stuff as the Gratify gluten-free pretzels.  While there are gluten free flours, this product is made entirely without wheat.  It is odd that the listing here does not include ingredients, but here they are:Corn starch, Palm Oil, Potato Starch, Sea Salt, Sugar, Cellulose Gum, Soy Lecithin, Leavening (Sodium Bicarbonate, Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate), Yeast ExtractA serving is 30g of pretzels, and has 140 calories, 50 of which are from fat.  There are 6g of fat, 3g of saturated fat, 420mg of sodium, 22g of carbs, and no protein.The pretzel sticks themselves are baked (not fried like many other similar starch products), and have a nice crisp crunch and a good salty flavor.  Since they don't have the nutrition of regular pretzels, they aren't quite satisfying to eat, so they are a bit more towards the \"\"junk food\"\" end of the spectrum.Do I recommend them?  If you are craving pretzels and keeping a gluten free diet, these will hit the spot and are recommended.  If you eat wheat, buy real pretzels.\"", "There's not much to say about these, but what there is to say is good.  They're gluten free but taste so much like wheat based pretzel sticks that I don't think I could tell the difference.  They have a lighter flavor and a little less crunch than some sticks, but that's a baking choice, and they're addictively good.If you can't have gluten but want pretzel sticks, I would recommend these without hesitation.", "This is a gluten free product that I like better than the regular recipe brands. The pretzel sticks are lighter and crisper than traditional sticks, and they make for fine snacking.I like Gratify Gluten Free Pretzel Sticks, and I recommend these for any snacker, whether or not gluten is an issue; they're delicious.", "Gratify Gluten Free Pretzel Sticks, Sea Salt, 8 Ounce...other than being Wheat Free, Milk Free, Egg Free, Casein Free, Lactose Free, Non-GMO Ingredientsa few things I liked about Gratify Gluten Free Pretzel Sticks, Sea Salt:* aesthetically pleasing shape, texture and color* small sized sticks* tender, crunchy, tasty* just enough sea salt* great for dipping or eating plainDoes Gratify Gluten Free Pretzel Sticks, Sea Salt, sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2013", "I was surprised that I liked these I got them in twits/sticks. Throw these in a mix snack bowl and no one would know they were not one of the traditional store brands. Did they taste exactly like say Snyder's of Hanover aahhh no, not really but there pretty good-and good for you.", "These are a product of Israel.  The bags are pretty good sized - 8 ounces is more than enough for the whole family to enjoy the treat - and they'll want to - these taste just like really fresh pretzels, in both look and taste.  If you don't KNOW they are gluten free, you probably would not notice they were any different from any other good pretzel - they are super crunchy and taste great.  If you KNOW they are gluten free, and you search for the difference, you might taste that there is a bit of potato flavor there.  That maybe just makes them even better though!The bag says they are Non-gmo, and that they may contain traces of sesame.  No food coloring or preservatives.", "\"When I get that craving for something to munch on, things like pretzels call out to me. I like the crunch of the Gratify brand. I do not worry about gluten but have noticed that when things are advertised as \"\"(fill in the blank) free\"\" it usually is unappealing and bland. Can't say this about the pretzels. They taste regular to me.\"", "I'm pretty impressed by these pretzels.  They're gluten free, but they don't taste any different from regular gluten-laden pretzel sticks.  The taste, the saltiness, and the texture are all just like the regular formula.  These are a great choice for people who love pretzels but want a gluten free option.  I also tried the twist shape of the same brand, and I think the texture is better in these sticks.", "I love pretzels. Which makes it hard to be gluten-free. I mean, potato chip fans do not have this problem!In my hunt for a good crunchy, salty gf pretzel I have had ones that tasted too much like sesame or other flavors than salt, and others that were mushy or gritty.The Gratify are, well, gratifying. The flavor and texture are spot on, and they are salty. Like a pretzel should be.", "So I never was much of a pretzel person, but removing gluten from your diet gives you strange cravings. I was looking for something to get up to 5 items for my subscribe and save and these caught my attention. After eating half a bag, I've come to the conclusion that they're not the perfect pretzel, but they're the best I've found that are gluten free.At first I thought they were a little buttery, but I think it's more a little oil flavored. Not in a bad way like they seem like they're greasy, but in a good way like dipping bread in oil. I guess that's understandable since palm oil is the second ingredient.They have a very good crunch. Most gluten free products have rice flour which can leave a crunch but often has a weird chewiness beneath the crunch. I guess that the potato starch and corn starch leaves just a good crunch. I'm very happy with the mouth feel of the glazed outside vs the crumbly inside.And the saltiness is just right for me too. The saltiness doesn't overpower the pretzel, but it definitely tastes salty.If anything, the outer glazed part seems just a little more slippery than normal pretzels--maybe the oil again. I can't compare to normal pretzels anymore, so it's hard to say if I'm being objective with this or not.So I may not be able to eat gluten anymore, but I don't miss pretzels with these!", "I snack constantly, so I'm always on the look-out for new products. Pretzels are a little dry, so I don't seek them out - but I like them well enough. I don't make any effort to eat gluten-free, but I don't usually care one way or the other.While these are gluten-free, and apparently that's a marketing strategy/health issue, I noticed no difference between these and any other brand of pretezel I've had. So if you can't eat gluten, but enjoy pretzels, I would think these are a good pick.There is no noticable aftertaste, beyond normal pretzels.They aren't very salty - which does make them a little bland for me, but I know some people prefer less salt.These are good, and I liked them even if they aren't an exciting snack - but no pretezel really is. I don't know if I'd make them a regular purchase decision - I'm usually more interested in something sweeter or saltier - but they're a good snack with normal pretzel taste.", "Gratify gluten Free pretzels are the best that I've eaten. The shell is baked just right, the salt is not too heavy or light, and the flavor is good. Other brands that I've tried left a strange aftertaste and creamy mouth feel. Gratify pretzels don't quite overcome that and have the texture of wheat pretzels, but they are close. They are not as good, but serve as a very fine approximation.", "\"My title pretty much says all my thoughts on this pretzel product. I was given two of them to review (the pretzel twists and pretzel sticks). They are definitely the most delicious pretzels we've had in my house, and everyone in my family (including the dog) feel the same way!Most of the times pretzels either overwhelm you with saltiness to cover up lack of flavor, or have too little salt and taste dry... this product has struck a perfect balance between these two points. The taste of the pretzels themselves are superb, they go down really well and have some sort of \"\"lightness\"\" to them. Hard to explain, but basically if you want some great gluten free pretzels or just delicious pretzels in general... i really doubt you will be left disappointed with these.\"", "I've never tried gluten-free pretzels before these, so I don't have anything to compare them to other than regular pretzels.  As it turns out these are quite comparable to pretzels that contain gluten.  The flavor is similar enough that I couldn't discern a difference unless I ate one followed by the other.  These also still have a nice, satisfying crunch with a good sea salt.", "These are real pretzels even if they are gluten free, without wheat flour. (They also come in the form ofPretzel Twists.) They are crunchy and have a good taste with just the right amount of saltiness. I really liked these. They did not last long.", "These are delicious! I don't make it a point to eat gluten free, but I can honestly say that I could not taste any difference in these pretzels and in other types of pretzels that I've eaten.  In fact, these are probably better tasting than most.  They have a really good crunch and a nice salty taste.  There is quite a bit per serving too so you really get a good satisfying snack."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.030739381909370422, 0.03093978390097618, 0.034563131630420685, 0.031708311289548874, 0.030504953116178513, 0.029116570949554443, 0.03340049833059311, 0.03347759693861008, 0.029878491535782814, 0.03368928283452988, 0.03320442512631416, 0.029417606070637703, 0.028277531266212463, 0.03730384632945061, 0.027507880702614784, 0.026952896267175674, 0.03711444139480591, 0.027296004816889763, 0.026650691404938698, 0.023789824917912483, 0.03397905454039574, 0.03160245716571808, 0.03609141334891319, 0.03293874114751816, 0.02987263724207878, 0.029442092403769493, 0.03161384165287018, 0.030603529885411263, 0.03067244589328766, 0.0334799587726593, 0.02827201783657074, 0.03589867800474167]]}
