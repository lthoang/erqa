We originally purchased a Kindle cover for her that gave it a \"\"book\"\" look, and that has worked great, but when we were getting ready to go on vacation I really wanted to give her Kindle more protection in the car and on the plane.The Marware Swurve Kid Proof Case is a nice bendable but sturdy case. It was very easy to slip on the Kindle. During our vacation it was dropped 3 times on the ground and even survived a cup of soda spilling on it! When the soda spilled, we immediately wiped the kindle screen and then pulled off the case. The case kept the soda from seeping into the plug areas. No damage done!I am very happy with the Marware case and definitely recommend it!\"", "While this case isn't pretty to look at, it does what it is designed to do. This case does an effective job of protecting the kindle in the hands of small children that have a tendency to drop things. It does take a bit of effort to reach the on/off switch through the thick padding, but again - this needs to be built like a fortress to withstand children using the device. You will still need a screen protector (think plastic covering) to protect the screen from scratches and greasy hands, but this product is great.", "\"I have a nice, portfolio style cover for my Kindle that I do really love.  It keeps my Kindle safe in my purse, it is light and easy, and it looks professional.So THIS case?  I love it too, but it is nothing of the above. Bright pink.  Not remotely professional.  It is pretty lightweight, and while it doesn't protect the screen from smudges or scratches in my purse (I do have a screen protector for that though), it makes me feel a lot better about using my Kindle in weird places and it makes me more comfortable with the idea of my younger kids using it (ages 7 and 9.If you drop this, the design of the case means the screen won't hit the floor, and it sure seems able to absorb a bunch of the shock.The Kindle snapped right into the case, and it is held in place very securely.My only real concern is that the narrow holes for the cords might be too much for big fingers.  However, my husband (who has self-described \"\"meaty hands\"\") had no problem turning my Kindle on.  If he can do it, I'm pretty sure most anyone could.If this case had a strap, it would be perfect. As it is, my hand gets a bit tired from holding it for too long.\"", "\"Our 5 year old son loves mommy's iPad.  So mommy bought the most expensive \"\"armor\"\" type case to keep it protected.  Jr. never broke the ipad, but he broke the case a couple of times.  Now Jr. has his own Kindle.  A flimsy case costs way too much.  Marware's kid proof case is not only affordable, but it has the durability that is needed for kid use.  There are not hanging parts to be broken off.  This case pops on easy, and can take a bump or two with no damage to your Kindle.  The textured design makes for easy gripping.  A must for handling by the little ones.\"", "I quite like this raspberry-pinkMarware Swurve Kid Proof Case for Kindle Fire.  The Kindle is much more secure than it is in the sort of case with mesh corners or elastic straps to hold it in place.  All of the various plug openings line up exactly as they should (not always the case) and the case is high enough in the front that if the Kindle is somehow dropped face down the screen will not hit the floor.  Even better, it is easier for my smaller hands to hold for a long period of time.  One tiny criticism - I would have loved to have seen a molded-in place to store a stylus.Grandma's $0.02 - TheMarware Swurve Kid Proof Case for Kindle Fireis kidproof enough for all but the youngest, most devil-on-roller-skates children, and it is also attractive enough for adult use.", "I really love this case, it is exactly what we needed to help our toddler keep our kindle safe. The kindle pops right into the case and firmly stays in place. We have not had any issues with it falling out at all which is a huge plus. The kindle has been throwing (toddler tantrum) in this case and lived on. The edges are thick and help little hands grip the kindle. Also, the case keeps the heat of the kindle away from your childs legs. Overall this is a great product and I highly recommend.", "We gave my Kindle Fire to our 5 yr old son when my husband bought me a new HD one for Christmas.  We already knew our son LOVES the Kindle, the majority of the books, games, apps, etc. on it were for him, anyway.  Not long after we gave it to him he dropped it and got a big crack in the screen.  He did it again and got another, smaller crack.  I was thrilled when I saw this!I put it on as soon as it came.  Regardless of the color (he's only 5, he doesn't think pink is girly yet LOL!) he's happy to have it.  It gives the Kindle kind of a grip for his little hand so he doesn't drop it (much).  He HAS still dropped it of course but thanks to the Swurve there have been no more cracks and the ones that are already there haven't grown!!  I wish they had these for the HD Kindle Fire, I'd buy one for mine. I can be clumsy at times, too.  This is a great product!!", "\"I wasn't sure I wanted to give up using myNew - Vuscape Prot Case Kindle Fie by Targus - THZ166USbecause it also acts as a stand. However, my preschooler loves using the Kindle and there are lots of great apps available for young kids. So premium protection won out, and actually I've enjoyed using the Swurve case.This definitely makes the Kindle feel bigger in my hands and more like a tablet than a digital book. Take your pick whether that's a good thing or bad thing. The speakers and on/off button are not blocked, though I could see how someone with thicker fingers might have a tough time pushing the button. The case is comfortable and easy to grip, textured but not at all \"\"sticky\"\" feeling. The Kindle has never popped out accidentally, yet isn't hard to remove when you want to. It's not a stand, but I've found it's pretty easy to prop up on things in an almost-verticle position.As for protective factor, I haven't intentionally dropped any Kindles to test it out compared to other cases. However, it does make me feel better about my child using my Kindle. The case provides a lip higher than the screen, so if you place it face-down it's not resting on the screen. But of course it doesn't cover the screen, so you'll likely want to pair this with a screen protector.The Swurve isn't what I'd pick for myself as an adult. As a mom who wants to share a Kindle with kids, it's great.\"", "\"This Certified \"\"Made for Kindle\"\" case serves as great protection for your kindle.  It slips on easily and offers lots of shock absorption and impact resistance. The solid foam case is easy to grip, and the power/volume buttons as well as charging ports are accessible with the case attached.  The pink color is a little bright, but I knew this beforehand.  This Marware case is great for little ones who may drop mobile devices frequently.\"", "I think this product does offer good bounce protection for the Kindle Fire, but I have issue with not really doing anything for the screen.  I understand that with a normal drop, this would protect the screen, because of the raised edges, but what about when you want to throw it in a bag with other things?  I strongly suggest getting a high quality screen protector to pair with this item.  I do agree with another reviewer that it is not quite as snug of a fit as I would like.", "\"I got this for my daughter, who can be a dropper. She liked the color and the texture of this case. It's a raspberry shade, very true to the image here. What surprised me is how stiff the case is. I expected something softer and more flexible. This is actually like firm foam, relatively stiff, with openings for speakers and charger. The on/off button is also accessible while the case is on so you'd rarely need to take it on or off.One possible drawback is that the face of your Kindle Fire will be exposed. If this concerns you for travel, you can reverse the KF in this holder and flip it around for use. Another drawback when compared to other cases (we have multiple KFs in our home) is that there's no stylus holder nor a slot for an \"\"if found\"\" card. However, one can write in Sharpie on the interior of the case.The material is pleasant to touch and will provide a good grip for KF users of all ages.\"", "\"I'm giving this case a 4 out of 5 stars for one reason... there is nothing to protect the screen itself.  I've got a 3 year old and a 6 year old, and I can't keep track of the number of times they think it is \"\"neat\"\" to try to balance on something new... so far, my Kindle has managed to stay clear of their theatrics, but I'm dreading the day that the screen itself cracks.I found it fun to actually put my Kindle in this case and bounce it off the wall - nothing happened to the Kindle, which is the point.  Again - I just worry about how exposed the screen is.  If they found a way to add on a flip screen cover so that when not in use the screen was just as protected as the rest of the Kindle I'd give it a full 5 stars.The color is bright and wonderful, and the foamy grip areas are actually quite comfortable.Note: There is no way to stand this up at an angle if you are used to using that function on another case.  This really is just for holding.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03172500804066658, 0.014966430142521858, 0.00017851150187198073, 0.036404240876436234, 0.38449907302856445, 0.061398059129714966, 0.008759218268096447, 0.0002513296785764396, 0.019740795716643333, 0.005658907815814018, 0.4232655167579651, 0.013152972795069218]]}
