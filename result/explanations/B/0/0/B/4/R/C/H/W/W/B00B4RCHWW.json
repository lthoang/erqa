Maybe not quite as good as an $80 headset without the microphone, but still decent.  For me it's hard to describe sounds, but I'll do my best.  The highs are pretty clean with just a bit of sharpness, but not to the point where it hurts to listen.  The lows seem more \"\"thumpy\"\" rather than \"\"boomy\"\".  Bass response is good, not overwealming, and they are crisp and defined rather than muddy.The ear pieces are very comfortable and a good variety of sizes is included in the package.  About nine pairs are includedThe cords have moderate contact noise when bumped or touched, but not too bad.The style of the cords is the wrap bhind the neck configuration, with the left ear being the shorter, primary earpiece and the right ear's piece wraps behind the neck.  Personally, I don't like this style and would rather have both cords the same length.  Additionally, when driving, my phone is usually on my right side, making the headset a bit awkward since you have to have the left earpiece in for the mic to be anywhere near your mouth.  On the upside, there is a clip included, so at least you can keep the cord securely in place.Also included is a handy cord wrap, which has spot that the earpieces snap into in order to keep them clean and protected.  There's also a soft case that's just big enough to hold all the pieces and accessories.  Also included is a right-angle cord adapter that's needed for some phones.  It wasn't required for my phone, though (iPhone 4).What I felt was really bad on this headset was the inline volume control.  Rather than using buttons, it has a teeny tiny slider.  It's near impossible to fine tune it, so I just leave it all the way up and adjust using my phone.While talking, voice quality is good, but I felt like the mic picks up or adds a bit of background hiss to the audio.  Using the multi-function button was easy.  Holding it down activates the voice control on the iPhone as you'd expect, and it allows you to answer/drop the call.  When listening to music it acts as the pause/play button.  There are no controls for skipping or rewinding a track.  This is basically how other headsets work as well.Overall, I felt that music sounded pretty good - maybe not my favorite headphones, but decent.  Calling/smartphone integration was as expected, with good sounding call quality, but I didn't like the earpiece arrangement favoring the left ear.\"", "Ear buds uses as a comparison baseline-Klipsch Image S4-Bose IE2 Ear BudsDevices used in testing-iPhone 4S running iOS 6.1.3-iPhone 5 running iOS 6.1.3-Samsung Galaxy S2 LTE running Android OS 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean)-Samsung Galaxy S2 LTE running Android OS 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean)-iTouch Gen 3 iOS 5.1.1 (Audio only tested)Fit-It was easy to find a good fit with these because they came with six sets of ear fit piece of various types and sizesSound Quality-Clear sound quality with voice calls and spoken work podcasts-Incredible range in frequency - I could hear high frequency sounds that could not with the two comparison ear buds-Great bass tones-Worked perfectly with each phone and iTouch I tested-Blocks out a ton of external noiseRemote/ Features-The inline remote worked remarkably well with all devices-Neat slide volume control on the remote-Straight plug however the ear buds come with a 3.5mm adapter if you need oneCons-I'm not a big fan of the Asymmetric cable design.

I'm exceptionally excited about not having to unplug my ear buds the next time I get a call while walking thought the airport.", "I've lost count of how many headphones I've owned and tested. Everything from $10 pairs to $300 pairs and currently my go-to pair for all around use are my Ultimate Ears U700s.  Yes I own better but the price and comfort coupled with the sound quality make them the phones to beat when I evaluate a new set.So how do the Sennheiser's compare?  These is the most Jekyll and Hyde pair of headphones I've come across in a long time.Build, fit, and finish: 5 Stars.These are really nice headphones in hand.  The soft rubber cord, the excellent fit in my ears, the quality mic/remote all add up to a really nice set of headphones.  Included is a soft zippered pouch carrying case and s/m/l tips to get the right fit in ear.  Additionally, construction utilizes the uneven cord style.  That is the cord after the split is short to the left ear with a longer cord to wind around the back of your neck to the right ear - very much the way Sony does their headphones.On the downside, the cord is over 5 inches shorter than the cord on my UE700s making the Senns barely reach my ear from deep in my front jeans pocket.  Also, this shorter cord makes it virtually impossible to wear the buds with the cord wrapped over the top of the ear to minimize microphonics, which were average.  Jack is straight style and slim.Sound quality:  3 stars.Here is where I was disappointed after having the headphones in hand.  The sound from them just isn't that great.  There is a tendency toward strong bass but as with most cheaper headphones that emphasize bass, the mids and uppers are compressed leaving the overall experience just muddy.Call quality:Call quality was very good on both ends as my wife reported that I was clear and didn't seem to be calling from a headset.Summary:I really wanted to love these headphones, they are the second most comfortable headphones I own.  But I just couldn't considering the most important function of headphones is sound reproduction, not feeling well built of being comfortable to wear.  Especially when added to the fact that the cord length was close to being unusable for me.3.5 Stars overall.", "I'm a bit of an audiophile on a constant quest for a set of high-quality headphones that won't break the bank and work well with my DROID (Galaxy S3).  I kid you not, I believe this is about the fifteenth pair of headphones to come into my possession on my quest.  It's not about the third worth keeping and my new favorite.FITSennheiser is kind enough to include all kinds of differently-sized earbuds to ensure you can get the fit you're looking for.  I have some pretty small earholes and was able to find a pair that worked well for me.  Paired with the right buds, the fight is tight but not uncomfortable.  And unlike some of the newer noise-isolating headphones, you don't have to get these things in JUST right for them to work.  They pop in easily and stay in place quite well, even when moving around.SOUND QUALITYBRILLIANT!  These bad boys are crystal clear and evenly balanced.  I listen to a wide array of music, so I tested them on classical, acoustic, rock, and instrumental (piano/strings).  The audio delivers crisp (but not piercing) highs balanced well with mids and a nice bass note.  The bass is punchy, but not overpowering.  I prefer this, but if you listen to extremely bass-heavy music, you may want to shop for a pair geared toward that sort of thing.NOISE ISOLATIONAnother 5-star delivery!  These function incredibly well at keeping outside noise out.  In fact, they function so well that it's a bit hard to hear yourself talk when using them on voice calls.  It's not a big deal in my book (just pop one out when on the phone), but some may not like it.  The 'buds drastically reduce environmental noise, but I am still able to hear louder things.EXTRA GOODIESOne thing I really like about this set of buds are all of the additional, high-quality accessories.  You receive a nice rubber holder that resembles a stick of gum.  They hold your earbuds securely and let you wrap the cord around it to keep it tangle-free.  The case resembles a coin purse and has a bit of spare room to keep additional earbuds in, etc.  Well done.CALL QUALITYVery clear. The asymmetrical cord puts the mic close to your mouth so people can easily hear you.In sum, I'd definitely recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a nice set.  They could use a remote for audio controls, but -- if you can live without -- these deliver.  To be clear, the headphones do have volume control and a button.  I am speaking about more robust controls such as forward and back like the 'standard' ones that came with my S3.I received this from the manufacturer for testing and review and have shared my honest experience in this review.", "Yes I believe there is such a thing... I had an older pair of Senns that gave out, so I bought a pair of jLabs to replace them.  Those sound rather muddy having too much bass as well as lacking any high trebles.  Did a bit more research and happened upon these Senns and thought I would go for them.  Glad I did.  I never realized how much fatigue I experienced with the jLabs, and now with these Senns I'm able to enjoy listening to my music longer.  The sounds are crisp and clear from the low bass to the high treble. The bass for me is just perfect; enough to feel, yet not over powering.  The treble lets me enjoy the percussion's in the back ground as the musicians wanted it to be.  The fit and comfort of these are flawless to my ears.  I don't even notice they're there.  I highly recommend these for someone who wants to enjoy the music as it was meant to be heard.", "I own Klipsch Image S4i and have to say that Sennheiser ones are very similar in quality. They both come with different sizes of earbuds and small pouch to carry the headset (I have older version of Klipsch, now it comes with little metal tin).I also used some cheap Skullcandy headphones and every time I moved the cable I could hear static noise. With Sennheiser I don't have any problems, the sounds is clear when I'm listening to music or talk on the phone, walk or run.The only thing I don't like is that the length between left and right ear cable is uneven, and there's no option to even it out. Other than that good quality headset!", "I have used several different models of Sennheiser headphones in the past and I am typically a big fan. This set delivers very nice audio quality. I usually use them for audiobooks or classical music. For the former, audio quality was good, but it is hard to compare headphones. For the classical music though the sound was crisp and clean. I did not find the bass to be overbearing at all, which is a problem that I have encountered in the past with other products. Also, the noise isolation is fantastic once you find the correct size buds. In this regard, you have 3 sets of buds, but also 3 sets of ear sleeves, which have a double layer of plastic and in my case provided a better fit and better noise isolation.The product comes with a nice high-quality storage pouch, a cable clip and a cable winder to prevent the cable from getting tangled while stored. Talking about the cable, I should mention that I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that there is no cable noise at all. I tried jerking it around and it did not affect the sound.For people with Nokia or Sony Ericsson phones, you get an adapter that is needed for the headphones to work properly. This does not add a lot of bulk, but it changes the connection to the phone from a straight-shaped one to an L-shaped one.In terms of call quality, I found them to be perfectly adequate, and the control for answering and ending calls as well as pausing music or skipping to the next song works great. In case you are not aware of how to skip to the next song, you do this by double-clicking on the in-line remote.The only aspect I thought could have been improved is the volume control in the line. Instead of using a system similar to the iphone headphones, in which you press to increase or decrease volume, this is done with a slider, and I found this to be a little awkward and hard to fine-tune.Except for that last criticism, I found this product to be truly great!", "\"Immediately fit became an issue. I've never had problems getting earbuds to stay in my ears. I attribute this to the stubbiness of these buds. And, yes, I did try every insert they give you. And, yes, my ears are clean. I also had a hard time making the seal \"\"close\"\" and block out ambient noise. Again, this is a fit issue and might be a personal problem. The sound is nice and clear. The microphone and volume slider are rather high up with bothered me at first but them realized that it puts the microphone close to my mouth where it belongs. No more holding it up to my mouth when driving. Brilliant. All other functions work well, as expected. I love the cord wrap it comes with. The buds actually fit inside protective mini cups. That's a great feature. The storage pouch is also nice. It's spring loaded, not velcro, so you won't draw attention to yourself when opening it. Well thought out, folks! Good job.\"", "\"Sub $100 headset market is saturated with a lot of choices. Often these are not exactly audiophile quality, and instead offer smartphone friendly functionality with extra design details to make them stand out from the crowd. From the moment I started to review MM70s headphones, I quickly realized how much effort Sennheiser invested into it's features to put them ahead of competition. Let's take a closer look at what I have found.Starting from the box these came in, you can see right away this is a premium product. You can literally take a virtual tour of these headsets and included accessories but simply turning and reading around this box. Along with headsets you get a decent amount of quality accessories such as two sets of eartips (in three common sizes each), a cable clip, a high quality leather storage pouch with a spring loaded closing mechanism, 3.5mm adapter for Nokia and Sony Ericsson smartphones, and a cable winder with two built-in earphone cups. I actually found this cable winder to be very unique, something I haven't seen with any other headphones I reviewed before, definitely something with a touch of German-engineering. Moving to headset itself you can't help but notice how light these are weighting only 10 grams. Although a very modest design, they still feature nice details of plastic and aluminum finish with a signature S-stamp that looks like a flipped Z. Earbuds itself are very small and literally disappear in your ears, followed by strain relief sleeves and tangle-free flexible cable with a soft rubberized touch. Another very unique element of the design that caught me by surprise was asymmetric cable length between earbuds and y-splitter which actually doubles as in-line remote. Being not familiar with such uneven cable design, it actually took me a minute to figure out the purpose of it. Left ear short part goes straight down while longer right ear part conveniently goes around the back of your neck. This way a cable dangles down only from the left side rather than a middle. I found this cable arrangement to be very practical.Such cable arrangement and in-line remote serving as a y-splitter put the integrated mic close to the level of your face to easy pick up your voice when making/receiving phone calls. Phone calls turned out to be crystal clear and person on the other side couldn't even tell it was in-line remote mic. Looking closer at this in-line remote you noticed right away another feature which I haven't seen anywhere else - a volume slider!!! Most of the today's headsets with in-line remote come in two flavors, either with a single multi-function button or with addition of volume up/down buttons for iPhone. These volume buttons don't work with Android phones. MM70s features a single multifunction button that works perfectly with a single click to play/pause/call, double/triple click to skip next/prev, and long press to start Google Now. To top it off, Volume slider makes this remote 100% universal and fully functional with either Android or Apple devices. Besides adjusting the volume directly on your phone, now you can also slide it up/down on in-line remote for an additional control to attenuate the sound level. The feature worked very well, although I found slider button to be a bit shallow which makes it harder to control with one hand, but not a problem with two hands. Either way, Android users will be very happy that finally they can adjust the volume from in-line remote without taking your phone out of the pocket.Since we are on a subject of volume, I guess its a good time to bring up the sound test. I did some burn-in by running white/pink noise loop for a couple of hours, but it actually didn't make much of a different in this case - its neodymium drivers were set and ready from the get go. Originally I had standard silicone eartips and dismissed the second set which had double-flange design. I'm personally not a fan of flanged eartips and find them to be too intrusive. But I decided to give a try with these Sennheiser double-flange tips, and actually found them to be very comfortable with a best fit and noise isolation. The passive noise isolation of these headphones was actually not bad at all, attenuating outside noise while still being aware of what's going on around you. Such isolation also helps with a sound quality, and that was my next point of review focus. From the spec, these headphones cover a wide dynamic frequency range of 18Hz-22kHz, wider than typical 20-20k. I found the sound signature of these to have V-shape with enhanced bass and treble, and recessed mids. MM70s delivered enhanced bass response with a nice warm sound. I wouldn't call it a super bass, but it was definitely not your typical flat balanced low end, and I felt a low frequency tight punch. I was a bit surprised mids were recessed since at first I assumed MM70s going to be a \"\"borring\"\" smartphone headphones. Treble was slightly enhanced but not as much. These drivers were definitely tuned to have \"\"fun\"\" sound biased toward low end.Overall, I was very impressed with a performance of MM70s and found all extra design details outstanding. These in-ear headphones, also referred to as ear-canal headphones, delivered a fun sound signature with enhanced bass response, they had very practical asymmetric cable design for a one-sided cable management, included great set of accessories with unique cable winder and comfortable double-flange earips, and provided a truly universal volume control in addition to multi-function button. Currently on sale for under $80, it definitely offers a fantastic value and a set of features to stand out from the crowd!\""], "Gamma": [0.030774757266044617, 0.030774757266044617, 0.030774522572755814, 0.030774757266044617, 0.058298733085393906, 0.03725024685263634, 0.030774757266044617, 0.030774757266044617, 0.030583295971155167, 0.030773349106311798, 0.030774757266044617, 0.0315808467566967, 0.030774757266044617, 0.030774757266044617, 0.5345408916473389], "Beta": [[0.00030988326761871576, 0.037643324583768845, 0.0002550591016188264, 0.00040699387318454683, 0.14130230247974396, 0.14296463131904602, 0.010251721367239952, 0.6638327836990356, 0.003033294342458248], [0.00030988326761871576, 0.037643324583768845, 0.0002550591016188264, 0.00040699387318454683, 0.14130230247974396, 0.14296463131904602, 0.010251721367239952, 0.6638327836990356, 0.003033294342458248], [0.0003098835295531899, 0.03764332830905914, 0.00025505933444947004, 0.00040699404780752957, 0.14130233228206635, 0.14296464622020721, 0.010251726023852825, 0.6638327240943909, 0.00303329573944211], [0.00030988306389190257, 0.037643324583768845, 0.0002550590434111655, 0.00040699419332668185, 0.14130231738090515, 0.14296464622020721, 0.010251719504594803, 0.6638326644897461, 0.0030332966707646847], [0.00024747103452682495, 0.03643988072872162, 0.00020351403509266675, 0.0004368696245364845, 0.1383972316980362, 0.14683276414871216, 0.009126696735620499, 0.6650158762931824, 0.00329974596388638], [0.0002905125729739666, 0.03729517012834549, 0.0002390565350651741, 0.00041537461220286787, 0.14046737551689148, 0.14407064020633698, 0.009915527887642384, 0.664198637008667, 0.0031076553277671337], [0.00030988326761871576, 0.037643324583768845, 0.0002550591016188264, 0.00040699387318454683, 0.14130230247974396, 0.14296463131904602, 0.010251721367239952, 0.6638327836990356, 0.003033294342458248], [0.00030988326761871576, 0.037643324583768845, 0.0002550591016188264, 0.00040699387318454683, 0.14130230247974396, 0.14296463131904602, 0.010251721367239952, 0.6638327836990356, 0.003033294342458248], [0.00031030538957566023, 0.037666793912649155, 0.00025545345852151513, 0.00040762213757261634, 0.14134961366653442, 0.1430036425590515, 0.01025475189089775, 0.6637143492698669, 0.003037478541955352], [0.00030988024082034826, 0.03764369711279869, 0.0002550627395976335, 0.0004069913411512971, 0.14130336046218872, 0.14296342432498932, 0.01025164220482111, 0.6638327240943909, 0.003033239161595702], [0.00030988326761871576, 0.037643324583768845, 0.0002550591016188264, 0.00040699387318454683, 0.14130230247974396, 0.14296463131904602, 0.010251721367239952, 0.6638327836990356, 0.003033294342458248], [0.00030722556402906775, 0.03759673237800598, 0.0002528631594032049, 0.00040810336940921843, 0.14119084179401398, 0.14311203360557556, 0.010206216014921665, 0.6638829112052917, 0.0030431230552494526], [0.00030988326761871576, 0.037643324583768845, 0.0002550591016188264, 0.00040699387318454683, 0.14130230247974396, 0.14296463131904602, 0.010251721367239952, 0.6638327836990356, 0.003033294342458248], [0.00030988326761871576, 0.037643324583768845, 0.0002550591016188264, 0.00040699387318454683, 0.14130230247974396, 0.14296463131904602, 0.010251721367239952, 0.6638327836990356, 0.003033294342458248], [8.58678831718862e-05, 0.031144898384809494, 7.033185829641297e-05, 0.0006059095612727106, 0.12496291846036911, 0.16560249030590057, 0.005268826149404049, 0.6673865914344788, 0.004872145131230354]]}
