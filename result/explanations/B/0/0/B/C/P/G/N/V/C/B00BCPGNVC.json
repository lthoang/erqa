The 1080p plasma screen is about as clear as any television we have owned.  Along with the crisp images the available internet apps and other browser choices almost replicates a full blown computer with its dual processor.  Using the remote with the on screen keyboard is unwieldy, so a Bluetooth keyboard would be in order. The wireless handshake and resulting through put is excellent.  Besides hooking it to Directv, we use it in conjunction with a PlayStation playing games online and dropping Amazon Prime movies.  Amazon's delivery and notification procedure is spot on, we couldn't have been more satisfied with the purchasing service.", "the reason i'm starting off giving it a 5 star rateing i don't want to bash this thing with only a few hours of viewing.The delivery was as expected on time and very professional they unpacked it set it up for me and cleaned up after themselves.I was not expecting a PQ near the flag ship F8500 I got this for my cozy little den and didn't want to spend alot. It's mostly for afterwork viewing and watching Baseball.my very first impression was the screen itself has some glare, ok i can deal with that, so if you are to put this in a room with alot windows with alot of light coming in you may be dissapointed.I watched a base ball game last night the color is very good and the blacks are good.i was living on the edge here because i also Have a PN50C700 and whan watch a baseball game the static image made some bad IR on the C7000 and had to swipe the screen to clean it up. I must say there was not any noticable IR on the F5500, but i will keep an eye on that. My PN60E8000 i have never had a lick of IR problems so i'm hoping the same will be the case here with the f5500There are three picture modes Dynamic Standard and Movie I like the movie mode myself, out of the box these are not the greatest settings standard was dark but i upped the cell from 12 to 13 and it brightened up, I went to Movie mode and it was fine but still needed some tweeks i think it's got alot to do with source you know what talking about you know your on one station the picture looks great you change the channel and wonder what happened to the color that why IMHO you need a good calibration the the picture is what it is and your not chasing color every time you change channel.I will update after a good breakin period.The set up was quite simple, the only bug I got and that may have been me! at first there wasn't any apps in the smart hub after a little while trying to figure it out I just reset the TV and started again, thinking I may have missed something. After a reset the smart Hub populated. Not sure i like the new smart stuff on this thing there is alot going on, maybe because I use to and like the smart hub in my PN60E8000.Comparing this F5500 to the E8000 the E8000 is beautiful in a bright room But I'm Afraid that if you get this F5500 it won't do well in a bright room, but a little over $800 i can deal with it.I put avatar 3D Blu-ray in to see what it would be like i was very impressed it goes to dynamic picture mode on the TV i was very happy to see this movie in 3D using Dynamic mode at factory default right out of the box was way better then i expected.I will update my thoughts in a few days once i get my teeth into this thing so i'll update as i go here.....Thursday May 2nd firmware update1.This firmware is for TV Model(s): LED F5500/F6300/F6350/F6400/F6800/F7050/F7010, PDP F55002.The version is 1102.13.This firmware update will improve the following:- Improves picture quality.- Resolves compatibility issue with Fitness Game Bikei must say that the improvement in picture quality has solidified my choice in buying this PN51F5500 i know there will be more updates.so the choice is yours which one to buy 60F5500 OR 60F8500 if you can afford the price i would still buy the F8500 if i had not just got the E8000 last May i would have gone with the 8500.so here i am I have a PN60E8000 and a PN51F5500After the firmware update i noticed the biggest difference is picture quality when i first got this tv it was a little troubling that i couldn't get the right combination with blacks and color flesh tones seemed to orange or too red and it was starting to trouble me. i was watching a baseball game last night (wednesday) couldn't get it to look natural even reset all the modes and it just wasn't right. tonight i watched washington and the braves after the firmware update the black players didn't have a greenish tint anymore they looked normal the white players don't look orange or bright red i maybe over stating it a bit but now it's very pleasing. blacks are nice and black flesh tones are more normal so i hope i explained it so you'll understand.here was my settingswhen i watched the ball game.picture mode standardcell light 16contrast 94brightnes 45sharpness 0color 48tint 50/50screen size screen fitdynamic contrast offblack tone darkerflesh tone 0rgb offcolor space nativewhite balance all at 25gamma 0motion lighting offcolor tone standarddigital clean view autompeg noise filter autoblack optimizer autothose are the settings I use for it directv as the source going through my TX-NR818UPDATE MAY 8th /13i'm taking one star off till i find out what is going on with this issue read below.i just had a new issue went into apps yesterday and played an Episode of Battle star galactic with (Amazon Instant ) finished watching it closed the app but the tv didn't go back to the the last TV channel i was watching but it gave me a black screen.my set up Directv Genie +  Onkyo TX-NR616 av receiver then going into HDMI 2 (ARC) into the TV.at first i thought it was odd maybe a HDMI handshake thing so i changed the Cables i had a Brand new high speed cable so i replaced it. ?????? then i thought maybe the reciever went out i reset it still nothing. all the smart stuff was still working just no source feed into HDMI 2. to make a long story shorter i reset every thing except do a factory reset on the TV i don't even know what i did but i got everything working again. mind you this has happened before but i thought maybe the TV switched source to HDMI 1 by default so i went back and forth and it worked. so i didn't think much more about it untill yesterdayso this morning i tried and tested it again watched something in netflix everthing looked good closed APP and everything was good watched more of the today show then just before i went to work i went into Amazon instant watched some episode of Star Gate Atlantis watched it for 15 min. then closed the APP and sure enough I get a Black Screen again took a deep breath powered everthing off TV, Receiver, and the Genie. after a few %*#K words i powered every off then back on and all was good again.so untill I resolve this issue (i did contact Samsung they said i sould rest the TV to Factory default and I'll do that tonight) if this fixes it i'll be a happy happy camperlittle update instead of hitting return a few times till it asks if you want to exit i hit the smat hub button works good or i hit the scource button and choose HDMI 2 That works good.UPDATE 6/4/2013I put it back to five stars because this TV for the price is a great buy colors are great blacks are black I love this thing", "\"If you read the other reviews you will have everything you need to know.  The reflective nature of the set can be a problem and we ended up hanging up some new drapes to darken the room certain times of the day.  Some people hate the remote.  I love the remote.  If you get everything set up, and your TV starts at the \"\"Smart Hub\"\" as some have complained, the fix is simple.  Go through the setup menu and you will find a simple option to disable it if you so desire.  Many of the complaints are simply not becoming familiar with the options in the various menus.  After two months, I really am somewhat of an expert when it comes to setting up various options.  All and all, I feel it is a great set BUT.....and to me this is a BIG BUT, when you set up the Smart Features \"\"On TV Settings\"\" you may have a problem if you don't live in a large city with one of the big cable providers.  I have spent countless hours with Samsung trying to resolve this problem without any satisfaction at all.  When you go through the setup process, it asks you to select a service provider.  It asks you to enter your zip code to find the right provider.  After doing so, the setup gives you a list of the providers in your zip code area.  For me, it lists four and one is my provider (zip code 824114 TCT West Basin/Greybull IPTV ) .... when I select my provider it asks me to \"\"press the channel up or down buttons on your remote\"\" and asks \"\"did your set-top box change channel?)  This is repeated three times, each time the answer is \"\"no\"\" and finally it asks me to \"\"Search model Number\"\" which I do. This does not bring up anything to select and it then says in part ....\"\"if it's not on the list now, it will be available soon.  Please quit and set up later.\"\"  Two months later nothing has been fixed.  Samsungblames it on my (can you believe this) service provider.  Of course, my service provider is unable to resolve thiseven though they spent countless hours talking to Samsung on the phone.  The problem is NO ONE who knowshow to fix this problem at Samsung is available.  You can call corporate, you can call level two support, and allthey can do is read out of the instruction manual.  It pains me to say this, but at this point I know much moreabout the setup than Samsung support. One Samsung rep told me my STB  was not compatible with their\"\"universal\"\" remote but I proved him wrong.  Another option after you enter your zip code and the list of providerscomes up is \"\"My provider's not here.\"\"  If I select it the following message comes up....\"\"On TV window of SmartHub will not be displayed, since your service provider is not supported.\"\"  Remember, by service provider IS listedas supported.  Anyway, if I continue with the \"\"my service provider is not here\"\" I can enter my service provider as\"\"Entone\"\" (the name of my STB) and now the remote works with my STB 100%.  BUT the \"\"On TV\"\" window of theSmart Hub will not function.  If you don't mind paying for the Smart Functions, then you will have no problemswith this television.  If they work fine, if they don't fine.  But if you want all the features that you paid for you maynot get them.  And Samsung support is poor at best.  Three times I was told someone would call me back withintwo business days but it never happened. There is no way I can find to check and see if your cable provider willwork with the remote etc. before you buy this.  And no logic when dealing with Samsung..  Buyer beware.UPDATE 12-19-13. Nothing new from Samsung. My Cable provider sent their two top IT people to my house a week ago and so far they have no clue. The NetFlix app no longer works. I will keep this link up to date.1/21/14 Update:  I am lowering the rating because of the following:I too must downgrade this set.  The picture is great, until you facture in the reflective qualities of the screen.  I moved into a new home and the TV is facing away from the window, yet I still get reflections of lamps etc.  In short, unless you have a completely dark room you will notice reflections.  Sometimes it is quite bad.  Other times it is not that noticeable.  Another gripe.  Samsung ignores my pleas to fix the remote to work with my stb.  Some of the support knows less about this TV than I do.  I get remarks such as \"\"your sbt is not compatible with our remote.  Even though I have proved it is not true, and even though  they have my isp listed as supported,  they have not been of any help whatever getting my problem resolved.  I own a Galaxy 3 Tab 3 10.1, and it's software doesn't work properly, I Own a Galaxy S3 phone, and it's software doesn't work properly.  So I guess I expect too much from Samsung.  When this TV dies, I will be moving to another brand.  I will do my homework next time.  Oh, another thing, my isp (cable company) has spent hours trying to work with Samsung.  You would think Samsung would try to work with them, but no.  Nobody listens at Samsung.2/27/14 UPDATE:  I said \"\"Nobody listens at Samsung\"\"..... Google this.... \"\"do Samsung Smart TVs spy on us?\"\" You may be shocked at the results.  I am disabling most of the \"\"Smart Functions\"\" as a result.  Buyer beware.\"", "I drive myself nuts when i start researching products due to the fact that everything you look at has good and bad reviews.If it has a preponderance of good reviews it's probably good. There are always folks who could either get a bad product, are VERY particular, or don't understand how to use the product.  I chose the plasma over LCD (LED's are only the back-lights BTW) because of superior black levels, off-axis viewing (never darkens no matter the angle) and lack of motion blur.  Modern plasmas don't use a ton of energy or act like space heaters as much as they used to.  Folks also complain about plasma not being that bright are fooled by showroom floor displays. These TV's on display are in huge bright rooms and are all cranked up on vivid setting; something you'll never do at home.  This tv is more than bright for an average home especially if you watch mostly in the evening. Sure the screen is glossy so you have to be careful of window and light reflections.  My old Sony Wega CRT had a glossy flat screen glass so it was nothing to get used to.  The speakers aren't bad as some would suggest either but i did upgrade to a Vizio 38&#34; sound bar with sub soofer. For $158 at Walmart it's probably the best bang for the buck out there confirmed by my reading and listening. Again, it's a lot different, and better, in your own house than a loud big-box store.  I've seen many LCD/LED tv's and i think i made the best purchase.  Get one before Samsung stops making them like everyone else did.", "I purchased this TV from Amazon after looking at some newer models in this price range.I like the new remote, it is very easy to use and it's nice to see some innovation instead of the same old push buttons.When I bought the TV, I was worried about the stand in the picture, but it is really nice. I like the height, it is perfect so I can lay video game consoles beneath it to make everything accessible.Setup was really easy and I like the TV Guide.I will update this review after I have more time to play around with the TV.", "I was a little skeptical to buy  a plasma TV because in the past they have not been so great. I have had this TV for over 2 years now and I am so pleased with my purchase. The TV works great and the picture quality is great. All the features work awesome on this TV. The sound quality is fantastic for movies or just regular cable and you cannot beat the price for the size!", "Keep your lcds and the others...give me plasma every time.  And now that the manufacturers are dwindling (just Samsung and LG left in the field) I wanted to grab one while I could.  Panasonic made the best but they've exited the market on these babies and that left me researching and deciding between Sammy And L.G.  Sammy won...L.G. lost by a wide margin.  But do your own homework and decide for yourself.  This one is a smart TV with the hub and all that...But I don't use it for that I mostly watch Blu-rays and 3D Blu-rays and it is a beautiful experience on this particular Samsung Television.  The price is good too...or was when I bought new ($797) delivered by prime (delivery wasn't as white glove as Amazon promises in my case...the wrong TV was delivered at first and I nearly didn't catch it because I wasn't expecting that..and the drivers never offered to take it out of the box or anything...so be glad you don't pay extra for the white glove delivery if you're prime...cause you may not get it.  And if you do pay for it I Wouldn't!!  The Television came very well packaged in the manufacturer's box shielding it from bumps and scrapes and the inner retail box was pristine when I opened it.  I've used it for thirty days or so and it's just great.  Set up is a  breeze and my son set up the hub and streaming part for me and said it was very intuitive.  He said the dual processor makes streaming and navigating a breeze but as I said I'll probably never use that anyway...well maybe Netflix if it's convenient...and I need to check and see if it has Amazon Prime come to think of it.  I may well have to update this review.At any rate I would highly recommend this model and so did Consumer Reports in it's size and price range if I can say that.  You can't beat plasma for the most vibrant picture out there especially in the blacks.  They've long since fixed all those weird problems you heard about at high altitudes when plasma first came out and even screen burn in isn't a problem anymore with automatic pixel adjustment and scroll bar rolling that's built into this model.  Download the manual from Samsung and bone up before it arrives and you'll be good to go in no time.One of the best large item purchases I've made from Amazon and aside from the delivery or extra service lack there-of...I had and have nothing to complain about.  I  do recommend this TV.", "Got first one and after about 10 hours of use it died on me. got a blinking red led light but no tv. contacted amazon and they replaced it for free and shipped the old one back for free. its been 3 days sense i got my replacement and all looks good so far.now onto the tv itself.The picture: 10/10Amazing! I do allot of hardcore gaming and watch allot of movies and in game mode there's no noticeable lag and in movie mood movies are awesome!The sound: 4/10The sound is not very good at all but i would not imagine anyone would buy this TV and plan on using stock speakers. I have it hooked up to 2 3 way speaker box's with 15&#34; woofers so sound from the TV is not an issue as its always off.Now for the reason for only giving it 3/5 stars. THIS TV BUZZES!!! LOTS!!! its very very loud and both of them do it so i'm sure its not a defect. But on the other hand i sit relatively close as its in my bedroom so if its going in a big living room then its not as noticeable.People complain that the stand is made of cheap plastic, who cares? I'm not touching my stand every 5 seconds so it really dose not matter what material they use.The 3D is cool but not my thing so not used.The remote is awesome once you get used to itThe wifi works great and loads Netflix instantly.If i have another problem with the tv ill re do my review so you guys know."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03543274104595184, 0.5055530071258545, 0.0006601433851756155, 0.000990440254099667, 0.02716982737183571, 0.39448899030685425, 0.002442932454869151, 0.03326187655329704]]}
