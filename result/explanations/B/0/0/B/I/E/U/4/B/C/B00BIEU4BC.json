"], "reviews": ["This coffee is labeled dark roast, which for some coffees can mean strong and bitter. But to my taste, this coffee has no bitterness and definitely does not taste 'burnt', but it also doesn't have a deep richness to it either.For those who like their coffee flavor strong, deep and rich, this may not be the blend for you. But most folks may find this coffee fits the bill very well. I'm not familiar with the brand name Community Coffee, but for me this blend makes a good cup of coffee.", "This is a good daily brew. Not gourmet coffee, but definitely much better than the standard supermarket brand. A good deal for our daily cup.", "I really like this coffee.  I played with the brewing process and found that using my drip brewer the best way to bring out the full flavor was to use the water at a full boil.  I found by doing that I could use a bit less coffee per cup.  The flavor is strong and hearty without the bitter under-taste that comes with some dark roasts.  If you want a bit less body in your brew, go for the breakfast blend it is a great coffee too - and a bit less bold.  For me though, this was perfect!  I like it better than the more expensive brands and would highly recommend this roast and this brand to coffee lovers!!!", "This is an excellent coffee! It is almost identical to the Folgers extra dark. Just not quit as strong and it takes about extra half scoop. It works great in the new Mr. Coffee BVMC-ECMP1000 Caf&eacute; Barista Espresso Maker I got in March. I'm going to have to start watching it and lay off of those Latte's. I've put on over 15 pounds from the!;-As for the coffee itself it has a very nice rich flavor and when made strong for that first pot in the morning it has enough caffeine in it to get you going on your day all bright eyed and bushy tailed. Like my mom would of said.So if you like a smooth rich coffee I don't have any problem with recommending that you try this one.", "As one who likes rich, strong coffee, I found this blend to be excellent. I was very pleased with the flavour, and believe it is economical, since even a strong brew can be made with less coffee than average.", "I have not had Community Coffee for years, I don't think since the explosion of local roasters and mass market, higher end roasters; certainly not since the growth of the higher end regional and national chains. Being from the South, I had filed Community Coffee away as a regional, mass market brand like JFG, and had not paid it much attention.But this dark roast surprised me with its flavor - deep flavor with a pleasant aroma. I really appreciated how low acid this coffee is, as a reason why I do not partake of many of the mass market brands, even lots of coffees at local diners, is because of the high acid content. This arabica, dark roast from Louisiana has very little acid content. I have had a few pots of this blend, brewed slightly different ways, with adjustments to water, amount of coffee, etc., and have been pleasantly surprised at the quality of this ground blend.As a regular coffee, for most days, this certainly compares well to me to many of the store bought Starbucks darker roasts, and I recommend this product.", "I'm always searching for good ground coffee to use in my office, where using a grinder is not an option for me. Community Coffee's Signature Dark Roast exceeded my expectations and I'll be buying more. The flavor is pleasant, not bitter at all. I think one reason why the flavor is so good is because the grind is coarse, which means less surface area for the air to attack and dry out the coffee's natural oils. This means you'll have to use a bit more grounds to get the strength to where you're used to, but it's worth it.", "\"I didn't know anything about Community Coffee, so this was a gamble.  My wife and I are not big fans of \"\"burnt\"\" coffee taste, which is what a lot of Starbucks coffees are like.  Oh, there's your standard store brands like Maxwell House and all that, but we had been hooked on a coffee from a restaurant chain in the Pittsburgh area called \"\"Eat 'n Park\"\".  Problem with that is that it gets expensive to ship the coffee to where we are, and we were looking for a cheaper alternative.  I work from home, so coffee is an essential purchase.Saw this, and decided to try a three pack.  Well, I have to say I really enjoyed it.  It's labeled \"\"Dark Roast\"\", which made me think that it was perhaps skirting the territory of \"\"burnt\"\" coffee from Starbucks.  Turned out that was not the case, it is a nice taste.  We're not coffee snobs, either, so I can't tell you all the high brow terms like \"\"aroma\"\", and stuff like \"\"a hint of cinnamon\"\".It's coffee. You put hot water in it, and drink it.  You either like the taste, or don't.  I like the taste of this, as does my wife, so we may have found our new house/daily coffee.  It's not harsh, it's not like some coffee I've had from some latin american countries). Despite it being called a dark roast, I found it to be a \"\"light\"\" coffee, which is the kind I prefer.Very pleasantly surprised, was expecting something I wouldn't like, as that's frequently the case, when I experiment with something new, but we really liked this.\"", "I love coffee and look forward to my first cup every morning. I generally use Costco's Colombian whole bean and like it very much.However, I do like trying different coffee (I recently tried an Ecuadoran coffee that was pretty good) and was curious about this product when it became available through the Vine program. I knew something was up when I opened the bag and smelled the coffee. It was not the strong, pleasant, invigorating smell I'm used to. The brewed coffee was no better. I used extra scoops (I like my coffee strong), and the resulting cup was still weak. The taste is not unpleasant but way too weak and mild for me. I will have to use it as filler to make the good stuff last longer.This might be for you if you're not a coffee freak, but if coffee is important to your day, forget this one.", "This coffee is just okay. It's pretty mild, has no special flavor like smokiness or depth to it. It's kind of weak, and if you use extra (expensive to do that) it just comes across as kind of bitter.", "This is a very nice coffee with a good medium strength flavor and no bitterness. Maybe not as good as some of the top brands (like Eight O'Clock) but could be a very good value for the money. It is not as strong as I'd like but not weak either, I will adjust the amount of coffee to increase the strength. Would I buy it though? Probably not unless price was really good. I usually buy regardless of price as I am looking for a very strong rich coffee and very few that I have tried are that good. If you like a medium strength coffee with no bitterness and good taste, then give this Community Coffee Dark Roast a try, of course that also depends on what it costs.", "I really enjoy Community Coffee.  I'd never had it before, but after a couple pots over the last couple weeks it's turned me into a believer.  I'm a huge fan of the richness of the dark roast, and the excellent flavor.  It could easily become my new every morning coffee, and I recommended it to our office as well.  Obviously with something like coffee what you think of it will vary based on your taste, but I recommend giving Community a shot, they are a great brand in my opinion.", "We have had several pots of this coffee now, and I would say that this is a good value brand. It's not one of the Starbux dark roast products, such as Italian roast or French roast, which is what we typically drink. However, this Community Coffee brand is good, not great, but good. I definitely prefer it to any of the mass market brands in the supermarket, but I don't prefer it to Starbux. The reason? I found it to have a bit of a metallic taste. I imagine many people wouldn't notice or care. For us, we'll switch back after this bag is done ... but we do know we have an affordable back-up brand ... just in case."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.08386947214603424, 0.0817883163690567, 0.08981775492429733, 0.07257244735956192, 0.08899007737636566, 0.07435816526412964, 0.04411942511796951, 0.08161613345146179, 0.07949753850698471, 0.08725936710834503, 0.06220080703496933, 0.08200211077928543, 0.0719083771109581]]}
