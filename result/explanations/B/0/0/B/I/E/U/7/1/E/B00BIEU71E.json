"], "reviews": ["Serves up a good strong cup without the bitterness. I really like this strong flavor. The only negative is that the bags I got expires in 3 months.", "Community Coffee Whole Bean Coffee, French Roast.  Full bodied, robust, perfect amount of strongness, not bitter but smooth.  Smell is awesome.  I love the smell of coffee, anyway.  If you love the smell of coffee, this would be something that you would love to wake up to every morning.  And if you love the taste of coffee, this coffee, I think, would be perfect.These are whole beans, so you have to grind them yourself.If you're hooked on coffee, or if you like coffee, I highly recommend this product.I love coffee.  I love the smell of it.  And I'm pretty much hooked on it.  Not so much to where I will go into convulsions if I don't get it, but it is uncomfortable without it.  After all, I've been drinking it since I was about 6 months old.  I love all types of coffee.Not only do I drink coffee, but I also make things out of it.  There are lots of good recipes in which you can make things out of coffee.  I love the flavor, the taste, and the smell of coffee; therefore, I love not only coffee as a drink, but also as an ingredient in certain recipes.This product is superb.  Highly recommended.", "I'd never heard of Community Coffee but I'm always willing to try a new product, especially a dark roasted coffee as I am addicted to good tasting coffee.  And, this coffee is really good with a robust flavor yet it is smooth.  I grind my beans first thing in the morning and I used 3 heaping tablespoons of coffee to 16 ounces of water and the result was quite nice.  I'm not sure that I will order it again, however, as I'm kind of loyal to White Coffee Company French roast which I've been using for a very long time.", "\"For the coffee hounds in the household this got nothing but rave reviews!  The features lauded were the rich flavor and smell.  It has also been recognized as having a \"\"gentler\"\" flavor as opposed to a \"\"bitter\"\" one.  For those who do like and drink coffee, this one is sure to be a winner as it is strong, but not bitter.\"", "This is a new brand for me. The first thing I noticed was the very nice aroma. The coffee is a strong, but not too bitter, European-style dark coffee. French roast can sometimes be a little too strong for breakfast, but this blend is appropriate for just about any time. I recommend it if you like strong coffee without the bitter taste that come strong coffees have. It has a hint of sweetness to it, a nice touch, but not enough to spoil it for those of us who don't like anything sweet in our coffee.", "I enjoyed Community Whole Bean French Roast Coffee a lot.  It's a very robust, full-bodied coffee.  Usually darker French Roasted coffees have a bitter aftertaste, but I've never tasted that bitter aftertaste with this coffee.  This is quite unusual for a dark roasted coffee.Because this coffee is quite strong, you could use less of it if you chose to.  Let you taste buds be your guide.The beans are not over-roasted as evidenced by the fact that these beans are not shiny.I enjoyed it very much and would certainly purchase this coffee again.  5 stars and highly recommended.", "\"Or, at least, one of the prime ingredients therein.Community Coffee is the \"\"State Coffee\"\" of Louisiana, and one that typically drink when I go to visit family there. The folks in that neck of the woods have a loyalty to the local nature of Community's business, and family and friends make good coffee great, and bad coffee better.So, it's not until I made some at home, alone, that I could truly evaluate Community Coffee's French Roast. It has been the smell of the morning (coffee maker with a timer) and the smell of the night (grind the beans the night before) for about a week.I like it. I will not claim that we're dealing with \"\"complex floral bouquets\"\" or any fancy ideas like that. This is good, strong coffee. It tastes like coffee. Like coffee I want to drink. The freshness was good--I see one reviewer got a batch that the vacuum sealing didn't take on the bags, but mine did, so I'm thinking that's a manufacturing glitch that would occur.The flavor is strong and solid, and the there is little of the coffee-burn on my stomach after drinking a pot across the morning.In all, I like the flavor. Right now, Amazon does not show a price due to an availability issue, but as with all of their grocery products, you would be wise to make sure you're getting a good deal. The coffee is worth more than the big-can brands, and I would tell you it's worth more than Starbucks. You will not regret trying it.\"", "I have always thought of French Roast coffee as being burned. And I was a little wary when I opened the bag and smelled that burned smell. However I just ground this coffee and made my first cup in a French press, added half and half and sweetner and it is fabulous--the kind of coffee that you can drink for dessert and not miss that slice of pie. It is full-flavored without bitterness. I will say that I took a sip without any sweetner and it was bit bitter, but sweetner and cream make it into a delightful treat for me. I've always been a fan ofCommunity Coffee Ground Coffee, Cafe Special, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3), but this French Roast Whole Bean coffee is wonderful--gourmet coffee house taste without the price. When this three pack is gone, I will definitely consider purchasing this product on a regular basis!", "This is a decent coffee, but nothing worth writing home about, I feel.  For a French Roast it is way more mild than I would expect.  Not robust at all.  I expect a French Roast to be bold, sometimes smoky.  This one is a bit bland.It is definitely drinkable, there's nothing at all wrong about this coffee.  The beans are gorgeous when you open the package, very dark and oily and I really had my hopes up.  But it drinks more like a light roast Columbian.", "I eagerly look forward to my weekend mornings, that's when I make the coffee. Mornings rush by so quick during the week, getting ready for work, getting the kids ready for school, I usually just grab a cup of coffee at my local Wawa. But the weekends are made for moving a little slower. I get my Community Coffee Whole Bean French Roast and grind up some beans then I put the grinds in my percolator because I love the taste of percolated coffee and in five minutes I can sit and enjoy my coffee. It tastes so fresh, so rich and robust but not bitter. This is my first experience with Community Coffee and I am loving it.", "\"There's nothing like the aroma of a good, strong coffee brewing in the morning.  THIS brand (which I'd never heard of before trying it), delivers an enticing smell upon opening the bag, and, once the brewing starts, the aroma is intoxicating. (Can you tell I love coffee? :>)Grind up some beans, measure a couple tablespoons of coffee per each 6 oz. of water, and you'll get the perfect tasting cup of rich, robust Joe.The coffee is imported, roasted, packed and distributed by Community Coffee Company in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where they've been operating the company for four generations.They say this French Roast is \"\"Extra Dark and Bold\"\", and they ain't lying! So if you enjoy a potent-tasting cup of coffee, give this one a try.\"", "I have had many different coffees over the years. But when I had found out that Amazon.com was making a original line of coffees' I was very skeptical to see if it was going to be worth the money. They have made some really excellent products over the years before in software accessories, and with jewelry recently, but coffee was just a mystery to me. Community Coffee was a brand that I had never heard of before. But when I had tasted my first sip of this coffee, I was definitely at how very strong this coffee was. It definitely had the richness and aroma of French Roast coffee that brands like Folgers' and Maxwell House, have tried in their coffees and fell not as rich. This is a great coffee mix, full of richness and its price is definitely worth the money.Price: B-Taste & Quality: B+Overall: B", "First impressions: None of the three bags received were vacuum-packed in the manner that withdraws air from bag and leaves the bag material tightly air-free and clinging to the bean bodies. However the expiration date of the packages is 12/22/13, giving plenty of time for consumption. Upon opening, I found the beans to have a fresh aroma and the consistent dark oily appearance expected of a dark roast.Prep: I carefully cleaned my Mr. Coffee burr grinder whose grind adjustment is 1/3 of the way into the fine grind setting. I shook out as many of the old beans as possible, then ran fresh beans from this bag through and dumped the results, brushing out all visible debris, hoping for no contamination. Then and only then I ground for this pot.Brew: Made a full 12-cup pot in a long-used, familiar Gevalia automatic drip machine. Carafe cleaned regularly with baking soda and well rinsed. Water allowed to run prior to filling machine in order to clear stale water from pipes.Cuppa Joe style: Used my preferred method of 1/2 cup skim milk heated in microwave, topped off with 1/3 cup freshly brewed coffee. No sweetener.Analysis: Right off I was hit with floral, winey notes. I felt smoothness with strength. Then the intensity of traditional dark roast broke in a very pleasant way. The smoky intensity lingered as an aftertaste, also pleasant and satisfying. Suddenly the fog left and I was delightfully wide awake so there is plenty of caffeine which is, for me, a requirement.Recommendation: Outstanding price/value. How can you do better? 5 1/2 stars.", "Community Coffee Whole Bean French Roast (Pack of 3) - This coffee provides a full rich flavor with a very smooth finish.  I like it so much I can drink it black without any sour aftertaste.  I don't know much about Community Coffee, and I didn't like their Colombia Classico, but this stuff, THIS is good coffee.", "I'm a coffee lover who rarely pollutes a good cup with things like milk or sugar so I've learned a thing or two about what I like in terms of roasts and blends. I primarily gravitate toward very dark roasts for their smoothness and lower acidity but even I enjoy a citrusy light roast or mellow compromise in a medium. Somehow though, I'd never given Community Coffee a try though.This particular French Roast is alright but lacks the full body and rich taste I generally associate with a French Roast. It's not bad, it's just not what I'd expect. If you love the lighter bodied medium roasts and the full flavor of darks you will fall head over heels for Community Coffee's French Roast. If you want a rich cup I'd say give this one a pass and opt for Tully's French Roast (my personal favorite French Roast) instead. That said, I think I might have to tryCommunity Coffee Whole Bean Coffee, Signature Dark Roast, (Pack of 3)as soon as I can get my hands on some and see if I like its body better.", "\"I credit Community Coffee with teaching me how to appreciate fine coffees. About 20 years ago I ran a coffee station at work, unusual for the time in that we ground our own beans rather than use packets of Maxwell House. I happened across Community Coffee and started ordering beans from them, in an ever-widening variety. Their catalog and even a book helped teach me how to brew a perfect cup and about differences among the various places in the world where coffee came from.It has been a long time since I had Community Coffee and was delighted to reconnect, as it were. I'm very much a dark-roast guy and my usual purchase isMayorga French Roastwhich I buy at Costco. I use a Jura \"\"superautomatic\"\" coffeemaker which I have found delivers the best out of the beans you put in it.The Community Coffee French Roast was very good, without the \"\"burnt\"\" flavor I associate with Starbucks and some other brands. However, I did not find the flavor as rich and complex as the Mayorga orKauai Coffee Dark Roastwhich I also like a lot. It was far better than most of the dark-roast beans I have tried, but not in my top tier.\"", "I was a bit hesitant when grinding some of the beans, the smell was strong before they were even ground!  To me this is seriously bold.  But! even the first cup out of the pot was not bitter at all.  My husband who likes almost burnt roasted ;) loves this and drinks every morning.  If you like your coffee strong you'll like this!", "Summary - if you like a deep, dark French roast coffee, this is a good choice.I grind in a compact Braun machine (Sorry, not a burr grinder) and brew in a stovetop Moka Express.  This coffee gives excellent results.  The intense flavor of a good French roast comes through, with little acidity for a neutral aftertaste, even when brewed very strong.This compares very favorably with Trader Joe's French roast which I buy regularly.Note: when I received these, I noticed right away the strong smell of coffee - a little suprising since these are vacuum packages.  THey weren't vacuum sealed,  They smelled fresh, though I couldn't help to think the coffee might be just a bit better if they had been properly vacuum sealed."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.055265866219997406, 0.057120803743600845, 0.05877513438463211, 0.07506254315376282, 0.06311774253845215, 0.05154464766383171, 0.0546749047935009, 0.05277916043996811, 0.0538581907749176, 0.051275160163640976, 0.05135148763656616, 0.04663148149847984, 0.06130044162273407, 0.050798200070858, 0.054446786642074585, 0.0517897829413414, 0.06590214371681213, 0.044305555522441864]]}
