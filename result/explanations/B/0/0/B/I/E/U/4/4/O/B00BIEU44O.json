"], "reviews": ["I'm a fan of Community Coffee but new to this flavor. It's not gourmet but good for your daily cup. The 5 star blend is a bit too mild. I prefer the stronger, more robust flavor of a dark roast.", "I would consider this on the lighter side of a medium blend.  It has a pleasing aroma and a slightly nutty taste, although I find it somewhat bitter.We're using this in our office with a one-cup-at-a-time coffee maker.  I know that 2 others find the coffee to be somewhat weak and double up on the amount used.Nothing really special, but not bad.", "I am not a big coffee drinker. I just have it occasionally and when I do I like something a bit rough. My wife is a regular coffee drinker and likes a nice mild cup so between us we straddle a nice spectrum of coffee tastes.We tried this after dinner one night and, surprisingly both liked it. A nice smooth cup of coffee with a very faint hint of caramel inside it and almost no bitterness. The problem was that there was something indefinable that we both thought was just a little...weak, missing, empty. I wish I could give you a better description but for all we drank and enjoyed it there was just the sense there was something else...missing.We'll certainly finish what we have and enjoy it but I'm not so sure we'd pick it up again in the future.", "\"The description of this product is that the acidity is akin to a \"\"winey\"\" flavor. That wasn't my experience. My husband, much more of a coffee aficionado than I, was enamored with this coffee (drinking all three bags in about 2 weeks) which is another way I can tell that \"\"winey\"\" isn't the best description for this coffee. This coffee has a very mild flavor.I drink my cappuccinos and lattes with about 1 cup of regular coffee in them and I made many with this coffee and was delighted that it didn't throw off the taste by being too strong but not so mild that I couldn't tell it was in there.I'll be the first to admit that I am not familiar with what makes a \"\"Five-Star Hotel\"\" coffee such a blend, however I can say that if you like milder flavors and aren't into coffees that smack you in the face, you'll probably like this one.\"", "I grew up in south Louisiana, where the bayous are as long as the day. Porches lines houses. Not just cement blocks masquerading as porches, but real, honest to goodness porches you'd hear about in country songs. They were wooden, planks laid side-by-side. And they had rocking chairs. In these rocking chairs were farmers, welders, shop mechanics, fishermen, grandpas and grandmas. I remember my grandpa rocking in that chair, near the time of the evening, after a long day in the garden.In his hand was an old porcelain cup, stained by years of use. Every morning he'd use this cup for Community Coffee, Dark Roast, and every evening, he'd use this cup for the same. I remember the stead rocking... rock... rock... and sip. This would go on for a cup or two. He'd go in, the day done, ready for tomorrow.In the years since then, I have grown and he has gone. My home is no longer among the bayous, but among the mountains of West Virginia. Yet, I have a cup I use to drink coffee and it is Community. Yes, he had his Dark Roast and I like mine sometimes flavored. But the rocking goes on.We have Yankee friends over, from time to time, and they like coffee... well, to taste what is foreign to them. The Hotel Blend allows for the warmth of Community's tradition to savor through, but does not stand as robust as some of the other roasts. It is not as bitter as you might find with the darker roasts, but is a milder taste for those who like that sort of thing.If you are wondering about the caffeine levels, don't worry. I drink four cups in the morning and it doesn't bother me.", "I had recently seen Community Coffee for the first time at a local (IL) specialty grocer and given it a try. I liked it so when given the opportunity to try the Hotel Blend (Medium Roast), I was happy to do it. I usually drink a dark roast, but sometimes I don't want such an overpowering taste. The Hotel Blend is smooth and tastes nice with milk or cream. The aroma is not strong. I will buy Community Coffee again.", "Should be called 3 star blend. The coffee itself is pretty weak, even after I added an extra scoop. It is pretty rough, leaving a very bitter aftertaste on the palate. I was hoping for a stronger, more smooth blend. The coffee at any diner is better tasting and stronger than this. Id you like weak coffee, this is the one for you.", "5 Star Hotel Blend deserves 5 stars.I usually make a huge pot of coffee, unplug the pot so it doesn't burn and microwave it the rest of the day.  It has been so hot, I haven't really enjoyed coffee until I made my first cup of this! It's 100% Premium Arabica Coffee.  Medium roast from Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  In my opinion - they really know how to roast coffee beans to a delicious, enjoyable product.I've been making one cup at a time in my Black and Decker travel mug gizmo.  The smell, as it's brewing, is heavenly and the taste matches it.  I drink it black.  It doesn't need anything added.  I've had coffee that needs creamer to mask an off taste - Community Coffee - 5 Star hotel Blend is very fresh and perfect on it's own.I think it would be outstanding for espresso. I may grind some finer and try that.I Highly recommend it!", "I personally like this coffee.  It has a light flavor with slight hints of an almost nutty aftertaste.  But it isn't for everyone.  For one thing when I say light, I mean light!  Even using extra scoops it doesn't really darken too much, so if you like your coffee strong and black, then this isn't the one you should be going for.  I like it either way personally, so it wasn't a deterrent for me.It would sway my thoughts on it a lot if it actually had a price tag on amazon, but it doesn't at the time I am writing this, so I won't discuss that.  But as long as it's not too pricey, I would recommend it.  Decent coffee.", "I love coffee.  I drink a lot of it.  I usually buy Starbucks or Dunkin Donut coffee.  This is very comparable.  Nice medium roast.", "\"I am an admitted coffee snob. That being said, I am willing to give anything a chance. I got this coffee from \"\"Community Coffee\"\" on a whim and thought I would give it a try. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. This coffee has a nice flavorful aroma. I am not exactly sure what they are getting at calling it \"\"Hotel Blend\"\" but I like it.  I would not call this coffee earth-shatteringly different, but it holds its own against some more famous labels. This coffee was able to get me moving in the morning. I prefer a darker roast, and look forward to trying that blend with my next purchase. The price is right, and with a 3 pack, you can't go wrong. Recommended!\"", "\"Naming this particular ground coffee the \"\"5 Star Hotel\"\" blend creates a certain expectation of the level of flavor to be found, but unfortunately the reality falls fall short of that expectation. Calling this is a medium roast isn't even being charitable, it's just wrong. It's actually an incredibly light roast with a bland and watery taste. The only way to get any flavor at all is to scoop in several extra spoonfuls than you usually would, and even then the flavor isn't \"\"bold,\"\" it's just bitter. The only selling point here is that the grounds do smell great. Don't bother with this coffee unless you prefer something on the extremely light side.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.08569104224443436, 0.0851055234670639, 0.0817292332649231, 0.08008722215890884, 0.0776050016283989, 0.08068037778139114, 0.07804802060127258, 0.07910076528787613, 0.07982230186462402, 0.08216336369514465, 0.09211815148591995, 0.09784897416830063]]}
