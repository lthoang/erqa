You really need to do a little homework since the TV alone will not give you the TRUE 3D experience unless you plan on just using it to watch regular television and nothing else. First I ordered myself theLG BD670 3D Wireless Network Blu-ray Disc Playersince the current blu-ray will NOT be able to play 3D content blu-ray movies. Per the recommendation of my friend, the first 3D movie I ordered wasTangled(yep it's a Disney movie but it was highly recommended). I made sure to have a couple extra HDMI cables on hand and I was ready. When the TV arrived I was impressed on how lightweight it was. It only weighed 69 pounds compared to my 50\"\" plasma which weighed 90 pounds. Secondly the TV is so incredibly thin, thank goodness the stand gives it great stability because at first I was concerned it could easily be tipped over.Now time for hooking up all my goodies. I previously had a Wii, Xbox, DVD recorder, DVD Surround Sound Home Theatre and Panasonic Blu-ray Player. Oh what a headache I had trying to connect all these devices back. After eliminating the DVD recorder and two hours later, I finally had everything hooked back up. The major problem is that this TV only comes with ONE set of AV/RCA Component Connection inputs. Luckily my Xbox and new LG Blu-ray player uses HDMI connections but my surround sound system, Wii and DVD recorder uses AV/RCA component connections. I ended up connecting my Wii by just the regular AV/RCA plugs and using the three component connectors for the surround sound. Then I ran the audio in and out from the blu-ray player to the surround sound. By doing this I had to eliminate my DVD recorder and I am not able to use my surround system when just watching regular TV or playing video games. LG should of included at least a minimum of two or more AV/RCA component connections inputs instead of having so many USB inputs. In time I will have to get a newer surround sound system which uses the OPTICAL Digital Audio Output jack technology or HDMI which LG is pushing to use. I did just order theViewHD Wii to HDMI 720P / 1080P Upscaling Converter, hopefully this will allow me to use the AV/RCA component inputs to hook up the TV to my surround sound. Even though the sound on the TV is pretty good, it would be excellent on my surround sound.I am not going to talk about technical stuff like the Hertz, retina display or resolution - that is not my cup of tea. All I know is that it was extremely easy to setup. The colors are vivid and the picture is crisp and clear. I just love how there is hardly any border around the screen, it might measure about half an inch if I had to guess. One bit of advice, I am all for energy efficiency but make sure to turn off the ECO feature. I was having one heck of a time trying to figure out why the TV's picture would go darker after a bit and then realized it was the ECO feature.The Magic Remote takes some getting to use at first, but you will love it! The scrolling wheel is a great way to quickly jump through the channels or you can use the pop up numeric pad to enter a specific channel. I really was hoping that one remote would control all LG Smart TV devices (SimpLink) but it does not. It will control basic functions such as play, stop, rewind, etc. for the blu-ray player but I still have to use the LG 3D Smart TV Blu-ray player remote for the search feature when using the apps or settings menu on the blu-ray player. Also if you accidentally bumped the remote, the cursor (selection arrow) pops back on the screen and you have to wait 5 seconds for it to disappear by itself. There is no \"\"exit\"\" button and you can't \"\"hide\"\" the remote to make it disappear on your own.It is true, you can turn any channel from 2D to 3D. It is not going to look like the true 3D from a 3D movie, but the picture will look more vivid and come more to life. I really like how easy it is to turn the feature on and off by the touch of one button which is located on the Magic Remote.Let's talk about the applications. Wowsers - this TV offers so many from the start.  Amazon Video on Demand is an available application as well as all the common ones like YouTube, Facebook, UStream, etc.  There are tons of many other others to chose from.Even though I have pointed out several flaws I found while setting up and using the LG 55\"\" 3D Smart TV, it is still a beautiful LED television that will leave you breathless when you see it. The ease of use, features, remote and the vividness of the picture is enough to give it 4 stars.EDIT 05/07/12: Wanted to mention that the Wii to HDMI 720P / 1080P HD Output Upscaling Converter worked excellent for eliminating the AV/Component connection for the Wii and using one of the HDMI input on the TV instead.\"", "\"I am replacing my 2007 Pioneer 5080HD 50\"\" plasma TV with this one (55LM6700), so keep that in mind. I also have a 60\"\" LG plasma in another room.Pros:* BEZEL: The slim bezel is nice. I was able to replace my old 50\"\" plasma with this 55\"\" model using about the same amount of wall space, thanks to the thin bezel.* POWER & HEAT: The power consumption and heat generation is superior to my old plasma. Nice... especially in Texas where you don't want more heat.* SLIM & LIGHTWEIGHT: Very slim TV - nice... and less weight too* SMART UPDATES: Can update itself using an Internet connection (I'm using a wired connection)* FULL HD (1920x1080) beats my old plasma* OPTIONS & SETTINGS: Lots of configuration options & settings to tweak (if you want); the \"\"Picture Wizard\"\" is a good place to start to adjust some basic (& important) settings.* 3D GLASSES: Six pairs of 3D glasses is a nice little bonus (but all adult sizes - no \"\"small kid\"\" 3D glasses).* 24 FPS PLAYBACK: Can play back 24 FPS film material correctly.Cons:* VIEWING ANGLES: The screen viewing angles and \"\"stability\"\" (changes with viewing angles) are noticeably reduced from my old plasma TV (but are supposed to be \"\"good for LCD\"\").* MAGIC REMOTE: The \"\"magic remote\"\" could use some improvement, though it's not all bad. Unfortunately it can fall over a lot, and the cursor can disappear for seemingly no reason.* NETFLIX APP: My wife tried the Netflix app, but likes the TiVoHD Netflix interface better - especially for pausing/playing & controlling the stream... but she is very picky. I think it's decent (especially if you don't plan on pausing the stream), though definitely not the best I've used.* GLARE: Compared to the plasma I had, the 55LM6700 screen has more glare and the screen is glossy; windows or bright lights in front of the TV could be an issue, but I've seen worse. I now see how I've taken for granted the good anti-glare screen of my old plasma. You may be better off with a matte screen. This is one of my biggest dislikes of this unit.* WEB BROWSER: Too slow to be useful.Other:* IMAGE QUALITY: It was harder to beat the image quality of the plasma than I thought... while the image quality is good to very good (especially when well adjusted), I think you have to go plasma if you want the very best. Tweaking the settings can get you closer though (but you won't be able to match the viewing angles of a plasma).* MAGIC REMOTE: The \"\"magic remote\"\" is both \"\"cool\"\" and annoying at the same time. Sometimes it has a bit of a fit and doesn't do what you want... and it can fall over a lot.* 3D: I just tried some demos accessible from the TV's features and the 3D was impressive (but the resolution was not because unfortunately they were not HD demos but maybe there are some there or they will add some HD demos later).* TWEAKING: If you want to tweak/calibrate, then the \"\"Disney WOW: World of Wonder [Blu-ray]\"\" is good. I'm still messing with the settings but think I'm getting closer to some that I like simply by using the included \"\"Picture Wizard II\"\" option in the menu.* I ordered my TV early May, 2012 and the unit I received was made in Feb, 2012.* Assembled in MexicoConclusion:If you want the best/excellent image quality and viewing angles, then I recommend a good plasma. For slimness, energy efficiency, and still good to very good picture quality, then this is a nice set if the glare from the glossy screen won't be a problem for you. I feel comfortable giving it 4 stars. If this had all the benefits of good plasma image quality, then I'd give it 5 stars.I will update this review as I use the TV more and find more pros/cons.\"", "Recently we decided to upgrade another one of our flat screen units.  I am a fan of Panasonic products and, despite misgivings after reading some bad press and questioning what I feel is a shady marketing campaign for the set I was interested in - decided to give their VIERA TC-L47E50 a try.  It was a total waste of time.  I then started researching numerous other options.  There are some nice units in this price range, but nothing else I looked at can really match the 47LM6700.  (I have the 47LM6400, but I cannot find any differences between it and the 47LM6700.  Although some charts do not list the same feature sets, everything I subsequently checked appears identical.)At any rate - the tv.  One of the most important features, for me, in LCD/LED performance is the appearance of black levels.  We have a 60&#34; Sony that does a great job.  This TV may be better. While some reviews - such as Digital Trends - have similar opinions, CNET's US site claims black level performance on the 55&#34; version is lacking.  I am perplexed by CNET's findings and wonder if there might be inconsistencies in these panels.  I can state, unequivocally, that the black levels on my 47&#34; set impressed me without any calibration, as soon as the set was on.  That isn't to say this set will not benefit from calibration.  The &#34;cinema&#34; setting, I think, is fairly yellow, and the &#34;standard&#34; setting tends to wash out bright colors.  These are easily corrected through some manual calibration - and this set has a ton of setting options!  It utterly destroys the Panny I tried in regard to its numerous possible picture configurations.The physical frame and screen on this set are beautiful - among the nicest we viewed in the numerous stores we shopped at.  Some higher end Samsungs probably had the closest appearance in terms of body style and presentation, but Samsung is not a brand I am interested in. The LG has a semi-gloss screen.  The gloss can add a bit of depth to the black levels and richness to colors - in the same way the glossy screens on some plasmas enrich the black levels and colors.  I do not think it is a stretch to say the black levels on this set, with additional calibration, can approach a plasma look (though you're unlikely to match a good plasma's black level performance on this or any LCD/LED, just yet).  Despite these positives, the semi-gloss can also be a drawback.  If you are buying this set to place anywhere near a window or bright light source, please keep light reflections in mind.  The semi-gloss screen will readily reflect light sources.The &#34;magic&#34; remote is easy to use and functions similar to a wireless mouse.  When we unboxed it I groaned and my wife initially made fun of it. . .but when I started using it I took to it immediately.  It is quite ingenius - but I suspect people will either love it or hate it.  If you prefer a conventional remote you can always program an all-in-one to work with the TV.I hooked this up to a soundbar and stream PCM sound from the set and I have it hooked up to a power saver surge protector with the TV running as the &#34;master&#34; controlling the other audio and video components.  The TV has a nice selection of network options, including, of course, Netflix.  Unfortunately, it does not currently come with Amazon's video service.  It also has an on-screen web browser you can use, which I found relatively easy to navigate with the remote.This is a superb set for the price.  You may also want to consider the 47LM7600, which is 240Htz (120 native/240 via software) and available through Amazon.  The 3D is a nice addition and looks fine, though it wasn't a feature I was terribly interested in.  LG wasn't very high on my radar when I started shopping for a new set.  They will be one of the first brands I investigate the next time we buy a TV.", "I knew it would happen.  First, we had compatibility issues with PCs, now we have issues with our TVs.  On customer service, LG scores a big fat ZERO.My TV is functional.  In fact, it works great as long you don't try hooking it up with non-LG products. I tried.  I tried hooking it up to an Onkyo stereo to no avail.  Onkyo did a WONDERFUL job of technical support.  In fact, I wish everyone gave the kind of support Onkyo does.  Anyhow, once it became clear the issues was with the LG TV, I tried LG support.  ERGH.  I spent a whole day talking to those guys: you know, the kind that have no clue what you're asking for, but try to answer from the script anyway.I wasted my day.  I ended up doing most of the research myself on WWW.  Turns out that LG TVs do not support a common protocol of surround sound, PCM.  You know, these things happen.  What really got me was the way when I called back to ask about changing the settings, LG tried to make it sound like it was Onkyo's fault and not simply a matter of incompatibility.  Then came the short answer from them: we don't offer it, so everyone else ought to change their protocol to AC3.Bottom line, if you buy it, you just get the product and not any type of support beyond that.  If you have a simple issue (like the fact that the smart TV seems to disable Netflix periodically and needs to be reinstalled) they're okay. If you expect or need more, nada from their side.", "This is my first LED-backlit LCD TV. I still can't get over the thinness of the panel, the low power consumption and superior display. The stand is excellent too, very good for this TV (I know some others don't think so but it really is sturdy).My favorite part of this TV, other than the bright display with great contrast levels, is that fact that Wi-Fi is built in. I've enjoyed accessing YouTube and Netflix, and it's great.I've been an LG fan for awhile. My blu-ray players are LG, so I'm used to the LG presentation and navigation for YouTube and apps. For the settings, if you've ever played Wii games, you know about pointing the remote and then selecting. It's extremely simple to learn.The 3D experience in my estimation beats alternatives because this type of battery-free glasses is easier on the eyes and it's as good as movie theater 3D quality.Finally, I think the value is outstanding, especially compared to where this market was at the end of last year. It would be difficult for me to justify the value proposition of stepping up to a faster than 120 Hz model because for most content I can't tell the difference anyway. I highly recommend this TV.", "Got this TV on Friday morning.  Tested it at noon at lunch worked ok, the picture is eh.  Passive 3D is amazing.  Came home late after work and turned it on at 9 PM by 10:30 PM the LED arrays are shot and the screen went dark.  The place I ordered it from won't take it back and I'm stuck with a technician coming to fix it this week.  The TV lasted less than 2 hours!!!!STAY AWAY!!!**UPDATE** Had to dispute with AMEX and Buydig eventually sent me a replacement.  Still the picture is okay.  I'm not blown away.  Should have looked at it at a store before buying it.  Even when it's functional I'm not impressed.  Can you say buyers remorse?", "I bought this because my old sony TV (10 yrs ago) was broken.  I researched awhile and planning to get samsung or LG LED TV.  Ended up i chose this one because the price is 300-400 difference.  So far this TV is not a bad one.  I think the color stills very sharp as Samsung tho.  I think Samsung is overprice now and LG is the good one to buy.  Only thing you need to do is update the TV firmware because it is not the latest firmware tho.", "I've been exploring the features on this television since April and still feel like I could spend a few more months exploring all of its capabilities.  Personally, I've been blown away by the performance of this product.  This is the first LG product I've owned and it is on par with the higher end Samsung and Sony LCDs out there.  We've had no problems with the tv whatsoever.At first we had to get used to having our television on a smaller base.  There was worry that the kids running near it or moving too fast would cause the television to shake and possibly tilt. Thankfully this has not happened and it was a matter of getting used to the design as opposed to poor design.  Also, this design makes it super easy to dust/clean behind the television. That's been a nice bonus for me.Set up was easy and everything was basically ready to go out of the box.  Programming the cable control was no issue.  The actual remote to the television takes some getting used to because it acts more like a wand than a traditional remote control.  It is necessary to point to an item on the screen before clicking as opposed to pointing a remote in the general direction and clicking that way.  Not a deal breaker though and fairly easy to get used to.The picture is great and the television is very sleek, slim, and lightweight for the 55-inche size.The sound from the speakers is better than any television we've had in the past.  Usually, the volume is under level  12- the sound is that clear.  There have been difficulties with the volume levels when streaming Netflix.  Adjusting the sound settings corrected the problem.The wifi features work perfectly and having easy access to Netflix is a plus since that is one thing we use often in the house.  I've experienced far less lag than I did when trying to stream Netflix through the Xbox 360.Gaming looks insane on the TV.  My son loves using the 2D to 3D feature to view some of his games in.  Overall this feature works really well.  We actually use the television as 2D more often than 3D but I cannot wait for football season to start and watch my games in 3D!The 3D glasses that come with the television are okay.  They are easily replaceable and won't cost a fortune if something happens to them.  They aren't fancy but they do the trick and it's nice to have 6 pair so that the entire family can watch a movie at the same time.If I had to go out and buy a new television tomorrow, this would be my first choice.  The entire family agrees that it is by far superior to the Bravia that we own.", "i wish i could tell you all the good and bad but that would take way to long so heres a short list of pros and cons:pros: price i got this thing for less then 8003d ( i like the passive version)picture quality is very good ( i have owned about every brand there is ( i worked for two large box stores))look/ designwifi capable/ smart tv (tho i never use it, i have ipad/ smart phones / computer for this function)cons: The trumotion is joke (the updates did not help)some of the extra settings make the picture look bad , this is common to over brands as well ( sony and samsung being the best)the remote", "\"I have been using my TV for about 4-days now.  I know Amazon has a separate shipping/packaging review area so I won't let what happened reflect on this rating, but I do want to mention that the TV was shipped in the store box with no additional packaging or protection. The first TV arrived with a cracked screen, but Amazon overnighted another TV (packed the same way) and it arrived OK.I bought this TV based on my experience testing one at a local electronics store. I was really impressed with the 3D quality using passive glasses which was a requirement for me (I did not want active shutter); I also really liked the remote. I found it super easy to type in the search fields and to make on-screen selections. It's very accurate and easy to use. And since the TV also has an IR receiver I was also able to add the TV to my Logitech Harmony 880 remote as well.It has taken some time learning how to use all the TV features correctly because the owner's manual is weak, which is probably my biggest complaint. It took me a while to figure out what all the 3D setup options were and what all the selections were for. The on-screen interface is very cool and super easy to navigate; especially with the magic remote. The only thing lacking that I wish it had is Pandora radio. There must be some legal reason because when I use the TVs web browser and go to Pandora.com there is no audio. IN LG SmartTV there are a lot of free apps, including some cool 3D programing.Picture quality is great with plenty of brightness. I was impressed that it was to my liking right out of the box. There is a short setup process when you first turn it on that lets you turn the energy saving feature on/off (I chose off) and if the TV is in a store/home (I chose home). It has no more or less light bleeding than any other LED TV I sampled, and has no light leakage. My Samsung had a more even backlighting, but that is only noticeable when it's a black screen; and seems to be a problem with a lot of LED TVs (all the ones I looked at anyway. One thing I would like to point out is that I seem to get the best 3D experience when the room is completely dark. I normally watch TV with a soft light behind the TV, but I now turn it off when I'm watching 3D. Glare also really impacts the 3D quality.To top all of this off, the TV is one of the most beautiful sets on the market. I replaced a 40\"\" Samsung LCD, and I was worried that this 47\"\" might be too big in the same space; but because it is almost frameless it is only 1\"\" wider (the Samsung had a distracting thick, high gloss frame). It has a sleek modern design with brushed metal accents. The stand is a very heavy plastic with a matching brushed metal finish.All-in-all I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I feel I got a great price and I love the package deal from Amazon that includedLG AG-F216 Cinema 3D Glasses Family Pack (6-Pairs) for 2011 LG 3D LED-LCD HDTVsand theLG NB3520A 300W Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer.***UPDATE***After using it a bit more I wanted to add a couple things:The light bleeding I mentioned earlier is only noticible on the initial startup splash screen where the LG logo is on a black background. Once the TV warms up there is almost no noticable light bleed on dark scenes. I am very happy with this.When watching a movie from a flash drive, the play, pause, forward, rewind, buttons on my Harmony remote don't do anything. I have to use the magic remote.We watched the Immortals in 3D and the effects were nothing short of amazing. We are so happy with this TV.***UPDATE 2***If internet access and Apps are important to you, you might be disappointed. To me the LG Smart TV Apps are pretty much worthless. I like Netflix, Amazon VOD, Pandora Radio, iHeart Radio, and Slacker Radio. The only one that this TV has is Netflix (it does work well). The TV has a decent web browser, but when I go to any of the radio websites they block the sound. Navigating Amazon Prime VOD is just a terrible experience and not worth the effort. I will be connecting my Logitech Review back to the TV. Bottom-line: Great hardware, disappointing web connectivity.If this were a 10-star rating system I'd give the TV an 8.5The 3D really impresses.\"", "I can't say for the speakers on this set (I use an external system and the built in ones have never been used), so other people talking about it being muffled, I can't say.What I can say is the picture quality is wonderful. This TV is light, good quality picture, Passive 3D (big for me), and has no noticeable delay when gaming.Some problems, to get the PQ so good, they went with a glossy screen (seems to be somewhat the norm now) and this causes some reflections, but nothing too bad.The remote took some getting used to, but I have a universal remote if I just need to switch inputs. The remote it comes with is great in my opinion for navigating the menus and store, etc. It does a good job.One minor annoyance, if you move the remote a bit (move the table it's on, drop it, knock it off the couch, etc) it makes the cursor appear for a few seconds.  This happened when watching netflix, but nothing too bad.The reason I gave it 4 stars is the netflix and hulu apps work well, but have this weird glitch that would happen every 5 minutes where it looks like it just panics and shows a lot of random cached pixels. I'm hoping this is a software issue that can be fixed.", "\"This review is for the 55\"\" Cinema Screen 55LM6700First, this TV is really striking.  The cinema view (no frame around the edge of the screen) is very nice, and everyone who sees it notices it right off the bat and makes a complimentary comment.The colors are fantastic, and clarity, too.  One problem with this is that you can TOTALLY tell when a television show is not filmed in true HD (ie 720p instead of 1080p)...so not all \"\"HD\"\" channels are truly HD...The remote interface is cool.  Very much like the Wii, it's a point and click, as in you get an arrow that moves around and like a wand, you just aim and click.  There are many apps, including Hulu and Hulu Plus, etc. (They are listed above, so I won't bore you.)  Be aware, if you do not have very high speed internet service, you will have trouble with streaming HD movies.Setting up the WiFi is easy.  Just follow the directions and be sure your router is set to \"\"pair\"\".  Be sure you have the WPA code available, too.The sound is great--and I LOVE the option to amp up voices.  I have a problem with my hearing and cannot hear mid-range tones (voices).  I have always had trouble with normal TV's.  Not this one.  Awesome.Watching movies is clear, and the 2D-to-3D feature works amazingly well!  (Better than the new Titanic movie, I can tell you that...the one they just redid in 3D...)  I'm impressed!The 3D movies make you want to reach out and touch someone.  Really.The glasses are really nice!  They are light and you don't realize they are on after awhile.  Unlike the old-school 3D TV's, you don't need batteries.  And getting 6 pair is a super deal.I left it on for hours, to see if it got hot (like some other TV's do).  It did not.  Very nice.Now, the bad...(Yup, there's bad...and no matter what I did, I couldn't get around it.)The black depth could be better.  It's more like dark gray.  I turned off the backlight (it's annoying to me) and still I don't get the depth I'd expect from a TV.When the TV shows a black (yes, dark-gray, but for all intents it \"\"thinks\"\" it's black) you see various halos around the screen's edge.  At first there was just one.  Now there are 6.  I called customer service, and they were NOT HELPFUL at all.  I had the TV for a day and called, and still they tried to blame it on using HDMI cables, instead of the supplied component cables.  I switched to component, and the halo was still there.  I switched back and it didn't change.  Nothing to do with cables.  I googled it and it seems that this is a common problem.  But LG threatened to charge me if I asked someone to come check it out.  Not cool.  Even when I told them that I was reviewing it here, they didn't seem to care.Obviously, I am not going to pay to have someone come out...So, the bottom line is that it's a great TV, but not perfect.  If you're into deep colors, you have to really play with it to get it, and still your blacks could be better.  The halos drive me batty, but not enough to get rid of the TV.  They do not show up when there is an actual show on--only when it's a black screen, like the menu or when you turn the cable box off and you get the blank screen.The voice-option makes it a winner to me.  The 3D is amazing.\"", "\"I couldn't be happier with this TV.  The picture is crisp and bright, not at all fuzzy.  You can watch normal TV all day.  My mother even commented the day after we set it up that she watched all her old favorite movies all day because the picture was so clear and pretty.  It comes with 6 pair of the 3D glasses and they aren't the super expensive type of glasses you need with some of the other 3D TVs that are out there.  The TV was easy to add to my already existing home entertainment system.  I just plugged the HDMI cable into the TV (access is on the side instead of making me feel around on the back of the set).  The remote control is, umm, different.  It works sort of like a WII controller.  When it moves, the TV senses it and a cursor shows up on the screen.  This is great when you want to do something with the remote and not so nice if you are lying on the sofa and have the remote beside you.  The remote was also designed to be comfortable in the hand.  I can understand this design in a game controller but for the TV remote it just makes it awkward when setting it on a table.  It also takes some getting used to moving the cursor around on the screen to select what you want to do.Since this TV came from Amazon, I feel like I should say something about the delivery process.  Amazon does not use US Mail or UPS for this delivery.  It was a professional delivery company (as opposed to package or mail delivery) and they called a few days in advance to schedule the delivery.  They showed up in the first part of the delivery window and carried the TV to the room that I indicated and then set it up and tested it for me.  They were polite and professional.Finally, 3D.  I learned something here.  I went out and purchased Thor 3D so I could properly test this TV.  I was so excited until I saw the blue screen telling me that my Blue Ray player could not play 3D movies.  Mind you, I bought the Blue Ray player in November so I would have one that could access Amazon Prime movies so I was really disappointed that I wasn't going to get to watch Thor in 3D.  However, I did watch the 2D version of Captain America using the 2D-3D feature.  It was \"\"okay\"\", not great.  Obviously the scenes that were designed to jump out at you really didn't but the TV did a decent job of creating a 3D effect with many of the shots.  My recommendation is that if you are going to spend money on a 3D TV, get the 3D capable player at the same time.\"", "The picture looks very sharp to me; I have not noticed any bleeding or color issues, but maybe I'm just not sensitive enough to these things. I'm also a big fan of the 3D capability - it just looks impressive. I thought 3D might be mostly a gimmick, but even 3 months after purchasing the TV, I still get excited about 3D movies.The selection of apps is a bit light, but I don't think that's worth taking off even one star. The bottom line is that TVs are never going to offer the up to date apps and features that you can get with an HTPC (Home Theater PC) - and even if they did, nobody would want to use them with a TV remote. Instead of spending a lot more money on a TV that offers something marginally better, spend a little on a Boxee and get not just dozens of functioning apps, but also an easy way to stream wirelessly the media on your computers. That's the setup I use, but I added a 2TB external HDD to the Boxee. Thanks to Boxee, the HDD becomes available on wifi, which means I can save to it directly from my home network.All my TV is streamed - either from Netflix, Vudu, or Amazon. I don't have a cable subscription or even an antenna. So streaming content matters a lot to me. However, TVs are not and may never be as good as a community maintained tool like XBMC (powered by a full feature computer), or even a dedicated media device like Boxee. If streaming content is your desire (and it really should be, or you're missing out!), supplement your TV with a tool built for the job.", "\"While I didn't buy this set from Amazon, LG keeps rejecting my review on their website so I'm posting here. I despise companies that \"\"filter\"\" reviews on their website, not allowing any bad reviews. One only needs to go to their website and see no bad reviews, and compare to all the bad reviews here on Amazon. For this alone, I'll never buy an LG product in the future.First I like the picture quality, the 3D looks great, and the Passive 3D glasses are very comfortable compared to the Sony Active 3D glasses I have tried. I was really impressed the first few days, but now I have had the TV a month, and I am no longer impressed. Had I not won this TV in a sweepstakes, I would have taken it back. As mentioned I've had the set a month, and not a single firmware update.Sadly this set has many problems, many if not all of them could be fixed with a firmware update, but reading some of popular internet forums like AvsForum I hear LG is horrible with firmware updates. There are also many other people reporting issues like the TV just rebooting on it's own, etc. But I am here to post my thoughts on the TV.1> I can't view a Netflix movie without the Netflix app freezing up, requiring a reboot of the TV. My old Sony TV as well as my PlayStation 3 stream just fine, so I know it's the TV. I also have 20meg Comcast/Xfinity so I know it's not a bandwidth issue. I will say one positive thing about the Netflix app is that it supports Closed Captions, which my old Sony set did not.2> Their suggested Plex media server software sucks, it freezes, and simply won't play media or constantly stops, buffers, and then plays, repeat, repeat. These video streams are from sites like Hulu, ABC, Crackle. I have used PlayOn for streaming for years, but when that is running on my computer it causes the Menu system on the TV to freeze, so I have to disable the PlayOn server, and reboot the TV. So now I have no way of streaming TV.3> Poor Korean to English translations everywhere. One thing about Sony, they may be Japanese, but they know where the bulk of their customers are, and work hard to translate things.4> An app store full of worthless apps, so much for a smart TV. Even one of their \"\"featured\"\" apps called K-Pop, is geared towards Koreans.5> No music streaming services like Pandora, Google Music, etc.6> After the TV has been running for a while, I sometimes am not able to open the \"\"Home\"\" menu to change inputs or what not. So I have to shut the TV off, and back on.7> I wrote their email support, and was told to call. Why even have email support if you're not going to support people. If I wanted to speak to someone in India, about a Korean TV made in China I would have called.8> There is no option to adjust their Trumotion feature.9> Small gripe, but you have to set the time manually, unless you connect to an Over the Air antenna, in this day and age with internet time sync why is this feature left out?10> Final last small gripe, no custom label inputs, thus my PS3 & Xbox are both labeled \"\"Game\"\"Well that's about it, hoping for a firmware update soon, but not counting on it. I seriously would suggest anyone dropping $2000 on a TV look at another brand.\"", "\"This handsome TV features a thin bezel and modern look, ease of use with attractive menus and very good picture quality.Set UpLike all other flat panel TVs, once you unbox the set, you'll need to assemble and attach the stand.  LG's stand seems a little flimsy.  There's some give when you touch the TV and the manual gives specific instructions on where you should grab the TV when you pivot it on the stand.  I've had no problems, but a more substantial feel would be comforting.When you first turn on the TV, it takes you through a few easy steps to set it up.  Pairing with the remote, joining your wi-fi network, choosing your energy saving preferences and the like.  My TV also found a software update once it was connected to my wi-fi and prompted me to upgrade.  Easy.Performance and The FlawI'm a TV production veteran of many years.  I'm really picky about picture quality in some respects, but don't care a bit about some of the things some TV reviewers seem obsessed about.  What you can see with test signals isn't very important.  What matters, in my humble opinion, is what you are seeing when you sit down to watch.  Are you watching the movie or watching how your TV performs?  The LG's picture quality is very good, but there's one Flaw that takes me out of the moment and makes me pay attention to the TV.The LG 6700 uses LED edge lighting.  It results in splotchy light leaks around the perimeter of the screen.  The Flaw is visible during dark scenes and in a darkened viewing room.  How bad is it?  It's invisible 99% of the time, but when the movie ends and the credits come up, there's those glowing globs around the edges.  When the hero goes into the haunted house with a flashlight, there's those ghosts all around him.  Turning on the Energy Saver feature, which reduces the backlight when the room is dark, lessens The Flaw somewhat.It's pretty easy to overlook The Flaw since the LG has a great picture otherwise.  Good, well saturated color, plenty of contrast and good brightness.  3D performance is stunning.  If you want to change something, you'll find every adjustment you can think of in the settings menu.  So overall, I rate the LG's picture very good despite The Flaw.This LG is one of the many new TVs that use glossy screens.  Glossy screens give a more vivid and colorful picture than non-glossy screens, but at a cost.  They are much more reflective.  Is a glossy screen for you?  Pretend your TV screen is a mirror.  If you're sitting on your sofa looking at that mirror, would you see a strong light source, like an unshaded lamp or a window?  If so, you'll prefer a TV with a non-glossy screen.This LG's audio performance is mediocre.  There is an EQ built-in the settings menu, but using it to boost the bass makes little difference.  The speakers just can't reproduce it.  While the audio is fine for dialog, I think LG assumes you'll use a sound system if you care about fidelity.3DThe LG uses passive 3D glasses.  They produce a good 3D viewing experience and have an advantage over active shutter glasses in that they are much cheaper to buy, don't use batteries, and are universal among brands.  Next time you see a Real D 3D movie in the theatre, hang on to your glasses.  They work fine with this TV.  You get 6 pair of 3D glasses with this LG.  Your local Best Buy carries additional glasses from LG and Real D including kid sizes and clip-ons and high-priced premium stylish ones.Here's the part of the review where I expected to dismiss the 2D to 3D feature.  The LG, like many new BluRay players, will synthesize 3D from regular 2D content.  Darned if it doesn't work pretty well.  It's not as good as real 3D, of course, and you probably won't use it that much.  (Are you going to start watching CNN in 3D every night?)  But for a few choice programs, it's surprisingly good.There's a button on the remote that toggles 3D on and off with one button press.  All in all, LG has done everything possible to make 3D simple to enjoy with a minimum of fuss.  Push the 3D button, put on the glasses and eat your popcorn.Smart TVThis TV has apps, just like your smart phone.  There is no longer a menu where you adjust picture and sound settings.  There's an app that does that.  There are apps to switch inputs, search for available video you can download, browse the internet, turn 3D on and off, display media from your smart phone or computer, display the user's manual and on and on.  21 apps come preloaded on the LG, and you can download more.  Most of those are gateways to other content, including a lot of children's programming.  Most are free.You can get to the apps you've installed through the My Apps menu, or through the home screen which also has a \"\"Premium\"\" menu where you'll find Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and more.  The \"\"3D World\"\" menu has a number of streamable 3D programs.  Most menu screens keep the program you were watching when you entered the home screen boxed in the upper left corner.  You can select it to close the menu and return to your program.LG's operating system seems rock solid, but some of the apps are buggy.  The internet browser, for instance, seems impressive at first with tabbed browsing and flash installed.  But some websites will lock it up, even to the point where it's difficult to make the browser quit.  And while flash is present, using it will bring a warning that you're using an old version and it won't be supported for long.  Another app, AccuWeather, gave me a face full of error messages when I tried to add Fort Lauderdale to my favorite cities.Still, LG has sent out at least one update since my set was built, so there's reason to believe the bugs will get squished eventually.Media Link allows you--theoretically--to view your computer's media files on the LG's screen.  It requires a third party app, Plex, to be installed on your computer.  I have a MacBook, and the Apple version of Plex crashed immediately when I launched it.  No Media Link for me!The RemoteLG has gone its own way with the remote control.  Instead of a wand with a zillion buttons, you get a wand with a few buttons that works like a Wii controller.  You wave it in the air to move a cursor on the screen.  It's clever, but I have gripes.First of all, the buttons are mostly surfaces flush with the face of the remote.  Also, there is no light or glow-in-the-dark lettering on the remote, so when it's dark, you're left to fumble about on a seemingly featureless wand.  I don't know how many times I've moved the cursor over the icon I want, then pressed the button only to have the muting come on.  That's the button directly below the select button.While you're waving the remote around, it stays on.  When you're still for a few seconds, the remote turns off.  So if you're perusing the menus and pause to read something, the cursor will disappear and you'll have to shake the remote to get it back.  When this happens over and over, it gets annoying.  Also, if you take a swig of your drink, then bump the remote when you put down your glass, a big red cursor pops up on the screen to spoil the mood your movie was trying to build.While I struggle with this remote, everyone else in my household like it.  Pointing at icons on a big screen is much better for them than searching for the right button on a crowded remote.  Ordinarily, I put the original remote away and just use my universal remote.  Not this time.  Everyone but me wants the LG remote.  It stays on the coffee table.  But I'm not out of luck.Even though the LG remote is an RF remote, the TV accepts IR signals, so my universal remote will work with it.  Well, up to a point.  I can navigate using arrow keys, but there is no button to call up the \"\"home\"\" or \"\"My Apps\"\" menu.  The upshot is that I'll be able to do all the non-smart functions with the universal remote, but apps and on-line content will require the LG remote.The Bottom LineThe LG is a smart, easy-to-use TV with a lot of really cool features.  Picture quality is very good and highly adjustable.  Plus it's a handsome piece of hardware with its thin frame and nearly all-glass face.  Yes, I have a few gripes, but there were plenty of cool surprises to offset them.  Five stars.\"", "\"I'm quite happy with this TV, especially the picture quality (I have the 55\"\" one). Even standard def DVDs look great (not sure if that's because of the TV, or the upscaling from the Bluray player). The automatic 2D to 3D works surprisingly well, but it's by no means perfect and isn't a replacement for genuine 3D Blurays, but it's fun to play with. It came with 6 pairs of 3D glasses which was nice (they are the simple passive \"\"sun-glasses\"\" style glasses, not the bulkier (and more expensive) active style.I was a little worried about reflections from the glossy screen in my livingroom, but reflections are hardly visible, unless you are sitting to where a lamp reflects directly from the screen (I had to relocate a lamp because of that).When I first used the remote, I thought it was great - it acts like a mouse that you move in the air to move the mouse cursor on the screen. But after using it for a while and the novelty wore off, now I'd give up the mouse cursor in exchange for more buttons - it only has buttons for \"\"Back\"\", \"\"Home/Menu\"\", \"\"Volume\"\", and \"\"Channel\"\". I wish there were an input-source select button since I switch between input sources a lot (Roku, Bluray, DVD, Cable box), so instead of as simple button press to switch sources, I have to push the menu button, use the pointer to point at the input sources iconand click, wait for the input sources menu to come up, then point at the input source I want and click.I'd rather have 4 buttons so I can just select HDMI 1 - 4. I don't use my TV as a web browser, so the mouse-cursor part of the remote is just not that useful. However one nice thing about the remote is that it's an RF remote, so you don't need to point it at the TV and even if someone is standing in front of the TV it still works.The TV supports HDMI-CEC to allow compatible Blu-ray players and other components to be controlled over the HDMI connection. This works with my Panasonic Blu-ray player, but I already have a universal remote that controls the rest of my devices, so this isn't as useful as it might otherwise be.The biggest shortcoming for me is the lack of Amazon Instant Video built-in to the TV. It has a Netflix app built in (and a whole app store of free and paid games and other useless apps (at least useless to me)), but no Amazon.I was hoping to move the Roku to another TV, but had to keep it on this one to use Amazon. I'll probably end up buying a new Blu-ray player (not LG since their Blu-ray players don't have Amazon either), and use it for Amazon instant video so I can move the Roku to another TV.*UPDATE*They've added an Amazon Instant Video App to the TV, which is nice.\"", "ProsCinema screen with thin bezel2D and 3D picture qualityResponsive magic remoteSmart TV featuresPlays multiple video formatsAudio qualityConsScreen glareInternet browser doesn't  play some video filesSometimes slow to respond to move to different screensSummaryI replaced my 5 year old Samsung TV (LNT4061) for this one and I'm an extremely happy customer. This is a fantastic TV overall with cinema screen, it's gorgeous. Great 2D and 3D picture quality with lot of details. Audio quality on this TV is not bad.  I connected this TV to Sony blu ray home theater BDV N790W that has Audio return channel (ARC). Please make sure Simplink is ON and ARC on to get sound thru' home theater. It's a delight to watch 3D movies on this TV with passive glasses with minimum eye strain. 2D to 3D conversion is superb. I would recommend to do a Google search for correct picture settings if you are not happy with your factory settings. Screen uniformity and black levels are good.Remote is a joy to use. Typing is extremely fast comparing to regular remotes. Full web browser works well for almost on all websites, but I did notice some web based video files are not played. DLNA support is good. You tube works great. Netflix streaming is good as well. There are lot of 3D contents in 3D world. Decent amount of apps are available.Screen glare may be an issue if a light source is in front of this TV. I also noticed a small lag when you switch between different screens for example, when you are watching TV and want to go to home menu, it takes few seconds. It's not a major issue, but a minor inconvenience. I would have liked to see Amazon instant videos on LG apps , hopefully soon.I've been a Samsung customer (I own many Samsung gadgets) and never thought LG would be as competent as Samsung in LED TVs, but after owning this TV for a month,  my opinion has changed.", "\"Amazon ReviewThis is not a fresh out-of-the-box review as we've had this amazing TV for a couple months now. I have never been a fan of 3D. The few movies I've seen in the theater I've seen in the theater I've not liked. So all that to say, I'm a genuine 3D skeptic.Let's start with the bad:My wife hates the remote. Understand that she still cannot figure out how to answer her cell phone and is the type that if it has more than an on-off button, she gets confused. The colors are very very vivid, almost to the point of distraction. Adjustments have not helped to our personal liking but that's just us and this is a minor issue.Now for the good:I love the remote and so do my kids. It's very similar to the Wii. It's an amazing looking TV, very svelte. Although it came with a white glove service, I was unable to take full advantage of it so I had to set it up myself. This was also very easy and rather basic. The picture quality is super crisp and almost too revealing. You can see every imperfection Hollywood does not want you to see.And now for the hard part:I love the 3D. We immediately purchased a 3D compatible BluRay player and a movie. I was amazed. It's a PIXAR movie and I've not yet purchased a \"\"real life\"\" 3D movie. However, I was blown away with the 3D and I am no longer a sceptic and anti-3D guy. This TV does a great job rendering and presenting the film with no glitches or other bugs.Final report:I'm going to give it 5 honest stars. Although my wife would give it 3 because of the remote she hates, I am giving it 5 because I am so amazed at the quality, the looks, the ease of set-up and I'm blown away at this technology. Albeit I did grow up with black and white TV in the early 60's and I am easily impressed, this is truly an impressive TV and one of the best toys I have. I'm actually proud to own a TV like this.\"", "\"I've been staunchly holding onto my old Samsung 50\"\" DLP, replacing the bulb every year or two, simply because I had yet to see an LCD or Plasma screen match the image and color quality of that old DLP.  Well, after receiving this TV, the Sammy was instantly relegated to the garage (I can watch Formula 1 racing while working on my own cars, it makes me feel way cooler than I am).The first thing I noticed was that this TV is very solidly built.  It's heavy, and it feels like a slab of 1\"\" steel plate (though not quite -that- heavy).  No creaking or flexing of plastic when removing it from the box or putting it on the stand, and it comes with handy edge guards that protect it from bumps while also giving you a more solid grip.  It's also very thin, too, certainly thinner than my old 19\"\" deep Sammy.  I'll actually need a wall mount or a new TV stand because it looks silly on the Samsung's old pedestal.Plugging everything in is a breeze, lots of HDMI ports, optical audio, and a handy ethernet port (though it's got built-in wifi).  Turning the TV on, I finally experience the thin bezel around the screen.  At sitting distance, it almost looks like the image is floating in the air, the frame around it is thin enough to blend in, which does actually make the viewing experience slightly more immersive.LG's interface software, and its cool motion-controlled remote (think like the Wiimote) is pretty stunning.  I use a Google TV box so I haven't played with the LG's software options too much, but from what I could tell it is supremely usable.  It will even stream media from your network with hardly any setup, though I can't speak to the formats it plays well with.The overall image quality is stunning, I don't know a better way to describe it.  The color and lighting is smooth, but the details are sharp, there's no grainieness, the blacks are truly black without any weird halo effects that I could see.  LG really does make some of the best panels out there.The 120hz upsampling of standard TV is...neat.  It's very effective, it really does make things seem super smooth which might be an advantage for sports.  It's hard to get used to, and it took me a while to figure out why everything felt off to me when watching normal programming, but it's easy to turn off, you can even reduce the intensity of it to get -some- smoothing without going overboard.  Higher framerates are the wave of the future (already standard in Europe), so I guess I should be trying to get used to it, but it makes everything feel like a soap opera!I didn't have a terrible amount of luck with the 3D, but I never really do.  I'm glad they're passive glasses, though, and they don't seem to reduce brightness too much if at all.  There's an option to have the TV try to convert -everything- to 3D, which is actually hilarious, things pop in and out of plane, people's faces go from normal to inverted (i.e. their facial features actually go inward toward their face), we actually had a pretty good laugh at it until the headaches started, but what can you expect from a TV trying to convert a 2D image into full 3D?  Not happening.Anyway, it's a fantastic TV, thin, thin bezel, gorgeous image quality, lots of options, built in software for all sorts of stuff, sturdy build quality...  I'm blown away.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.00034499296452850103, 0.00043990625999867916, 0.39326196908950806, 0.0019666061270982027, 0.0118837496265769, 0.0030773631297051907, 0.00293101673014462, 0.003655689535662532, 0.000598758808337152, 0.0039606899954378605, 0.05057286098599434, 0.004000090062618256, 0.0006715027848258615, 0.0023105561267584562, 0.30547213554382324, 0.09152472764253616, 0.0006288675940595567, 0.07106920331716537, 0.0029435676988214254, 0.04868568852543831]]}
