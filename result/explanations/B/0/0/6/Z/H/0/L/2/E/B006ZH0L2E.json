I bought this on sale from Tigerdirect and saved hundreds of dollars.  My previous TV was just a normal 47\"\" LCD with a low 60hz refresh rate.  I was tired of seeing all the ghosting of dark images and there were color fluctuations...so I bit the bullet on this set.  Simply put, the set is amazing!  My friend has a Samsung 55\"\" LED and this is a better image all around.  The image quality is pristine and color reproduction is fabulous.  Blur is nonexistent.  Blacks are sharp and deep.  Also, the 120hz-240hz refresh feature on most LCD/LED sets creates a \"\"soap opera\"\" image effect but this doesn't happen with the LG model.  Thank goodness because that looks ridiculous.  My friend's Samsung LED TV looks like that and drives me crazy.  Even over-the-air HD programming looks great.I have it hooked up to my PS3 and aPanasonic DMP-BDT220 Integrated Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD Playerand the images are phenomenal.  The 3D feature is incredibly realistic and makes the movies look even better.  We were watching A Christmas Carol the other night and I was blown away and how flawless the image was.  It is also nice wearing the passive glasses as they are lighter and don't need to be recharged...and if you need new glasses they are so cheap.The smart apps are great, but we only use Netflix.  I wish it included Amazon Prime streaming, but that works on our PS3 and bluray player.  The image quality is just as beautiful using Netflix.  We also use the network streaming features and it connects without any issues and streams perfectly.  We have watched hours of TV over our home network.Some downside that I experienced is that the TV broke after about 1 month of use.  The left half of the screen began to flicker and was dimmed, which shouldn't be happening with such an expensive TV.  Fortunately, LG was quick to send out repair people and the TV was repaired to perfection again.  Also, the screen is incredibly glossy and this can cause viewing problems during daylight hours because of glare issues, however, it doesn't really bother me anymore.  The remote isn't perfect and can be annoying when dealing with it going inactive or being unresponsive, but it was easy to learn how to use it.  The last complaint I have is that the audio was out of sync with this TV.  I didn't have an issue with my last TV, but I was able to fix the problem through a setting on my receiver, but it was incredibly frustrating until I found the fix.Overall, I absolutely love this TV.  It has better image quality than any of the Samsung models I have looked and the 3D feature is a giant bonus that really brings movies and games to life.  I would rather have purchased the 7600 model, but I got this one for cheaper so I cannot complain about that.\"", "I can't even begin to start on how impressed I am with this LG Cinema Screen 47 inch 3D TV! But before I get ahead of myself let me get started with the basics: The TV came shipped & packed in the LG box that you can see in the costumer photos above- My TV was packed well and was very easy to take out of the box and organize all the stand parts, manual, controller and even the batteries and screws. (The controller did come with its own batteries, and the stand had screws provided) I am most impressed with the extra plastic/safely grips on the sides of the TV- for it made removing it from the box SO much easier but also protected the sides/screen during shipment. Setting up the stand was so very easy, but I would recommend doing it with two people especially after you assemble the two body parts of the stand and then need to screw the stand to the TV directly. Hubby was so very excited about getting a new 'toy' that he wanted to set up everything himself but after looking at the manual (I do suggest you read over the manual- even for those of you who would consider yourself very tech-savvy. Hubby is the one person in our home who is the wiz when it comes to cables and hooking up new devices but he was even surprised on some of the things this TV can do. The manual goes into detail about some of the new hookups (located in the back- ie HDMI to computer etc.) that he personally found the manual to be very insightful and even had information that he didn't know) he found that it would be safer to have me help him with the stand. Total time for stand and TV setup without turning the TV on: 10min! This might seem a little long but we adjusted the screen to fit our viewing pleasure, cleaned off our TV stand, and got all of our external devices ready to be plugged in after we get the TV turned on and set up. We honestly had some trouble getting our satellite dish working with the TV- we have DIRECTV w/DVR and couldn't get any signal from our dish. Even when we went through the channel search and lineup process we were told that 'NO Channels' were found- it wasn't until we went and hit the input setting area and selected 'HBMI 1' that our satellite dish worked. Other than this snag setup of the TV and the magic wand was simple and painless. The magic wand reminds me of the Wii remote- so we were both use to the style and had no issues controlling it. The only problem we have with this style of remote is that it is not compatible with out universal TV controller. In other words- we now have to use 2 TV controllers to work our TV. It is a pain because if I want to adjust the volume I have to use this one but for channel changing I have to use the other. But I can see why you are not able to get rid of the magic wand in place of the universal controller- for it is a whole different type of remote where your hand moves the controller. Going through the set-up process of picking your time zone, daylight saving etc. was very easy and only took us another 10min or less to complete altogether. Setting up your Wi-Fi was very simple and it reminded me of when I was setting up my computer Wi-Fi for it does have the same format. You pick the name of your Wi-Fi then enter your password and you're done! It was that easy! I really enjoy the fact that this TV has built in Wi-Fi and that all my devices can be on the same network + that they can all share video and pictures while being on the network! While I was messing around with the all the extras this TV can do I was really getting the feeling of how much this reminded me of a computer and then I thought: I want to see if I can really pull stuff from my computer to my TV via Wi-Fi... so I did! I pulled some videos that I had stored on my mac, it was simple and easy! I even pulled some videos that I had uploaded to my mac from a trip I took that I had shot from a little handheld video camera- and let me just say how amazing these came out. I was worried that they would come out fuzzy because of the size but the picture was clear and now I can pull up all of my home videos onto the big screen to share and enjoy on this new TV! But that's not all: I can watch them all in 3D! Awesome!There are also tons of apps that can be added and viewed from your TV: We were giddy just looking at all the different things we can view and do! We started with Netflix and Hulu+ but I can foresee hours of looking up apps and even more hours of entertainment just from this TV alone.While watching regular TV our picture is crystal clear, sharp, and just beautiful! I am amazed at the detail that we can see and how sharp the colors are. I switched out a Toshiba LCD for this TV (the Toshiba is currently now sitting in my bedroom) and the colors are so much more vivid and sharp when I compare the two of them. One of the minor things that I have really enjoyed and 1st noticed right when we turned it on is that my Toshiba has a black bar or cover holding the TV screen in place vs. the LG is ALL screen! Let me just say what a difference this makes when viewing and if you're really in the market for a new TV I have to highly suggest you get a screen that goes out all the way without any types of bars. What is truly amazing is the fact that you can easily switch from 2D to 3D with just a push of a button. When you hit the 3D button it gives you different options on how you want to view the TV in 3D from standard to split screen. 3D viewing is just as clear and sharp as if you are watching it without 3D, so you don't lose any resolution by watching it in 3D. Comes with 6 pairs of glasses that are very light weight and comfortable to wear. We wore our glasses for a few hours and my ears didn't feel pinched and my eyes were not hurting from long use.What has truly impressed us and sold us 100% on this LG 3D Smart TV (along with all the apps, easy ability to switch from 2D to 3D, and to share a Wi-Fi network with my other devices) is the fact that I stick a regular Blu-ray movie into my Magnavox Blu-ray Home Cinema Surround Sound System and now watch that movie in 3D!!! AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! No 3D Blu-ray player needed!! Just to make sure we tried it on 2 Blu-Ray movies:  Avatar & The Green Hornet and we could watch both of them in 3D perfectly! The screen pops out just as much as it did when we were watching regular TV.  I am so happy because I was talking to hubby about going out to buy a 3D Blu-ray player but now we do not have to! I can't honestly say if this is the case on all 3D TV's but when hubby and I were at Target this last weekend checking out 3D Blu-ray players and asking about clarity of watching it on our TV we were told by the TV tech that to his knowledge when you watch a movie through DVD player onto a 3D TV it will not convert that movie to 3D. Now I'm so happy that we didn't buy that 3D Blu-ray player! But it gets even better: Yes this TV will convert your gaming (we have a PS3) into 3D gaming but when reading about the TV you're told that you need to buy special glasses. Nope! As soon as we hooked the PS3 up it asked us if we wanted to change our settings to allow for 3D and we said yes. Hubby got to play Call of Duty: Black Ops in 3D with the glasses that they provided.  Now for 3D gaming the screen REALLY popped out even more than watching TV. When he was playing the gun fire was flying so clear that it really looked like it was coming straight out of the TV at us.  Hubby said that it made the game harder to play and will take some time to get us to it, but we are excited to try out other games in 3D.Pros:Slim designClear vivid colors and pictureTons of Apps to choose fromAbility to connect other devices through Wi-FiConverts TV 2D to 3DNo need for 3D Blu-ray PlayerDon't need special 3D gamer glassesComfortable 3D glasses includedEasy to setup and customize to youGreat sound qualityCons:Wish I didn't have to use two remotesIn conclusion I am so very thrilled with my LG Cinema Screen 47 inch 3D TV! I am so very happy with everything that it can do and look forward to discovering even more apps as I continue exploring. The quality of TV with picture and sound is just perfect plus the fact that I can easily share contest on my Wi-Fi network just adds to how much I am in love with this TV. The icing on top is the fact that I don't need to go out and buy a 3D Blu-ray player! If I could give it 6 stars I would and highly recommend this brand and exact TV to anyone who is in the market. You won't be disappointed with it!", "\"Overall, I'm very impressed with this TV set, from its looks to its picture quality.  This model sits just below LG's Flagship 9600 which upgrades to full LED backlighting vs. this set's edge-lit design.  This likely gives the 9600 the slight contrast ratio advantage, and the only other notable difference (specs-wise) is that this set is 240Hz vs. the 9600's 480Hz. For me, I doubt those enhancements would make much of a difference, and in fact, I've found myself able to comfortably able to enjoy LG's G2 model nearly as well.  If you must have top picture quality above all else, and this set is within your budget, I'd have no problems recommending it.  I value usability slightly higher, though, which is why I prefer the G2 as a family room tv because of its usability enhancements in place of picture quality.  Additionally, manufacturers are split as to whether they use Passive or Active 3D.  LG LCDs use passive, which I've found more than adequate for casual usage, and with a house of kids and their friends, passive is much more affordable in letting everyone enjoy the show.Specs don't tell the full story, though!  For me, while specs are important they can be far overshadowed by poor design and user interface.  Overall, the LG's user interface is very good.  In this review, I'll cover the remote, the main apps interface and the tv's general usage controls.--------Remote:--------The magic remote is a combination IR/Bluetooth remote with motion sensing features like a Wii's remote.  This allows you to shake the remote to wake it up, then point and click rather than navigate using up/down/left/right.  The scroll wheel also serves as the \"\"enter\"\" button.  I like using this remote and the point and click is much more intuitive than a traditional remote.  The dedicated 3D button is convenient, however, I'd give up the 3D button for an Input selection button in a heartbeat.The down-sides to this remote are that it's not universal, and since only the power on/off uses IR, you can't use this as a universal remote, nor can you get the functions you need from this remote in a universal.  Therefore, you'll always be using more than one.  Additionally, unlike LG's G2 google tv's, the remote doesn't have a keyboard, so you'll be clicking an on-screen keyboard instead.  With an emphasis on Smart Apps, this is a downer.-------------Smart TV Apps-------------The included apps are decent, however they don't offer an Amazon Instant Video app.  I haven't tried using the included web browser to get to Amazon's video service yet using this tv.  I've found LG's proprietary apps like the 3D showcase to be of little value.  With the 3D showcase in particular, the shows are a static selection, and frankly they're pretty boring.  It would have been nicer for LG to provide a channel with the latest 3D movie trailers or other promo content instead.The Android apps are paltry and not worth wasting time.  You won't find things like Angry Birds, but instead the spammy-style \"\"love-meter\"\" type apps.  Hopefully the selection will grow, but don't buy this tv thinking you'll find a bunch of useful independent apps.--UI--I like that you can customize the tabs that hold the apps, however, I wish you could also place specific functions on them - such as dedicated input selections like HDMI1/HDMI2, etc.Speaking of inputs, I honestly can't believe the limited selections for custom-naming your inputs.  You can only select from a pre-determined list.  Therefore, if you have both a Wii and Xbox, you will end up having two inputs listed as \"\"Game\"\".  Yep, that's your only choice for consoles, though they've felt it relevant to have HD-DVD as a selection.  This makes things more confusing than it should be, especially when every tv for the past 15 years has allowed me to actually input my own name for a device, yet this one doesn't.The built in picture adjustment wizard works fairly well, although the choices are somewhat ambiguous as to what they actually do.  The cover the basic adjustments, but leave the user in the dark regarding the refresh rate, local dimming, ambient light sensing, and some other things that will also affect picture.  For those looking to actually calibrate your set, it has the more advanced calibration controls built in and freely accessible.-------------General Usage-------------Picture quality is absolutely outstanding!  I turned off the ambient light sensing, as it darkened the image too much, and also when you bring up menus, it would try to darken the screen - even the picture adjustment windows did this, which is not the time when you want your tv automatically adjusting the picture.The 240Hz does take getting used to.  It seems almost too sharp and blur-free, so it feels unlike watching a typical television.  If you're a big sports watcher, this is great; however you may find the effect a bit un-natural and want to turn it down.--3D--3D is really nice with the passive glasses.  I've had the fortune of being able to directly compare the 47\"\" model of this tv with the 55\"\" G2.  My observations show that this set seems a bit more natural with the 3D effect, whereas the G2 seemed to have more depth out-of-the-box.  The tv's allow you to adjust this settings, as well, so you can fine tune it to your preferences.  Additionally, I can sit at a pretty decent side-angle and still see the 3D pretty well.  It seems more sensitive to top-bottom viewing vs. side viewing.I've seen some complaints on the glossy nature of the screen.  My guess is that it's due to the passive filter on the screen.  It's not a pure glass-like reflection, but isn't a matte finish, either.  It does have a decent amount of glare from side or rear lighting, but we really haven't had much issue with it.  The set it plenty bright to overcome most average lighting scenarios.  The passive filter on the tv causes bright lights to have some rainbow effects, but you'll really only notice this if the TV is off.---------------------Physical construction---------------------The looks of this set are insane.  The bezel is simply a 1-2mm piece of metal, which doesn't overlap the glass at all.  The picture comes within about \"\" of the bezel, so pretty much all you see on 3 sides is the screen with a thin black border.  While the set is only about \"\" thick at the top, it's a couple inches thick at the bottom to accommodate the speakers.  The stand is cool looking, though a bit wobbly.  The stand allows rotation from side to side, but no tilt ability.One other point I'm not too happy with is that there's only one shared input for component and composite inputs.  These both use a small cable dongle which takes the input and combines it into a 3.5mm jack that plugs into the tv.  Therefore, unless you use optical audio, you can only get sound for one of these.  Additionally, there's no s-video input at all.  Our Wii uses the composite inputs, and our Blu-ray was originally hooked up using component.  I could only get the sound to the tv for one of them, since the red/white wires only connect to the composite jack.  Luckily, I was able to just buy another HDMI cable for the blu-ray.  If you have more than one legacy input from these sources, you'll need to switch them through a receiver or input switch.-----------Conclusion:-----------I have both this set and the 55\"\" G2 Google tv.  I chose to put the larger G2 in our family room because it's more family and user friendly even though the 8600 has a nicer picture and looks.  If I were a big sports-watcher or someone who places picture quality above user interface, my choice would have been the opposite.LG has produced a very nice lineup of tvs, however they still need a bit of improvement with the user interface.  The lack of namable inputs and direct input selection makes these sets less convenient to use.  The default settings rack way to much toward energy savings creating a dynamically controlled picture that's often too dark.Use of the magic remote is good, but the magic remote causes the need for more than one remote to use your other components, yet a universal remote cannot replace the magic remote, either.Otherwise, the Smart tv apps are a bonus, even if the Android offerings and 3D samplers are pretty much useless.  Hopefully updates in the future will bring these to be more useful.\"", "Every time I purchase a new electronic device with all the latest bells and whistles, I tend to get a bit nervous over the prospect of setting the thing up and making it work as intended.  This LG TV is fabulous!  It took all of ten minutes to set it up on it's sturdy stand, and another ten or fifteen minutes to have it up and running.  This television comes with 6 pairs of 3D glasses that are light, comfortable and battery free.  The HD picture is exceptional, and the color controls are easy to master.  I had my doubts about the conversion of standard 2D signals to 3D, but the experience was surprisingly cool; not in all instances, but in many.  The remote control is not button intensive, but is more like a mouse or a Nintendo controller, with just a few buttons and a trackball.  All you have to do is point to your selection on the menu and push the center button.  Establishing a connection to my wireless network was also a breeze and I was watching YouTube videos within a couple of minutes of entering my password for network access.  While I chose to place this television on the stand it came with, it is thin and light weight enough to mount easily on a wall.It's really refreshing to find a product that makes the most of technology in a way that makes it easy to experience.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could.", "Lots of research -Needed a 47 inch HDTV for living room - old style TV shelves built in to include TV position that was too.Based on reviews - caught a quick sales price opportunity and pulled the trigger. So happy with purchase.1. Had to search online for the best picture calibration. Out of the box the picture was not good. Comparing it to our LG 60 plasma.2. Wanted and LED/LCD type TV - but a good picture and price. Our LG plasma has been flawless.3. Wanted a thin TV with a good picture for 3D and wanted it to be passive this time. we have the active 3D downstairs.So far the 8600 has meet our expectations and exceeded some. Once we got the picture calibrated CNET review.... its all been very good.TV is lightweight - we're currently using the TV stand but have plans to mount it on an articulating bracket once we can modify the TV cubby.Remote is their magic remote. our first experience w/ the magic remote was with our plasma (2010), used it twice and stored it.since this was the only remote, had no choice. It was easy to use and get the 8600 updated (firmware), online - Ethernet and change settings for calibration. but since then we only use the remote to turn on the TV since we have DirecTV and use that remote for the channels plus have a Harman Kardon receiver that we use for volume etc. most likely we'll be setting one or both of those up as universal remotes. only make sense.we only used the audio speakers on the 8600 for two weeks, decent sounding but not going to fill the room. we use our Harman Kardon as the workhorse now. once you go HDMI and the receiver the 8600 speakers become inop.the good news - a decently strong person can lift the set by themselves to set it in position or move it to make changes. the picture is good, 3D is decent, not eye popping like active 3D does but good enough for our living room and much cheaper with almost free 3D passive glasses.con - not much we can say.... wish I had got the 55&#34; but the extra few hundred would have put me in the dog house especially when the TV would not have fit inside the tv cubby.", "LG Cinema Screen 55LM8600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 240Hz Dual Core LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glassesis a great way to display to your patients information that you were showing them on your iPad and/or Android tablets.  We can also run educational videos for them.  It looks super sharp in medical offices.  It is light enough to transport home for weekend viewing in dark home theater rooms and even though it is simple easy to set up with quickly with the different criteria, it was easier to just simply purchase a second one!  TV screens have really come a long way, baby!  Ended up purchasing a third for a special doctor friend in my life, too who can't stop expressing his gratitude and delight at the LG 55LM8600 - look at what a purchase spree this free gift from Amazon Vine and LG started : )", "This is my first 3D television.  I bought a 3D DVD player and 3D movie just to test it. Everything arrived the same day. And while I was very impressed with the 3D, it's the other things that fascinated me even more than the 3D.  This television really is a computer on the inside.It was so easy to set up the wireless network. It automatically linked up with my two computers via the network. And it is wireless N at that. I am watching home videos from my laptop computer via my wireless network.  So I can look at any shared photo or video. It has photo slide show and the picture quality is just amazing - all wireless from my computer. And the picture quality is very good.  I am so impressed with this television set.  I am still discovering things. It will take a long time to even learn all the things it can do. It has Netflix, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Vudu, Hulu, Cinema Now, and MLTV.  And they have joined the app movement where you can download applications - some for free and obviously some for a fee.The remote control is mostly an air-mouse with a cursor that appears on screen.  It is a little difficult for me to get it calibrated.  Sometimes I end up pointing at the floor or way off the left side of the television display. I think I have learned how to center it now. I have to shake it while pointing at the middle of the screen.  I really wish they offered a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse option. That would have been perfect. The virtual keyboard entry method is very slow. The more I explore, the more stuff I find. I wish they had a good user manual, but they don't.  There is a simple on-screen manual that is next to useless by the time you find it.  By then, you've already learned a lot of stuff by trial and error. They did not make any attempt to explain how to use what they call the apps (internet interface). You are on your own to discover how to use it. Many people will do just fine doing that, but there are many things for which I would like to read an explanation. Not everything is obvious. You are asked to activate things with no idea of what to expect ahead of time. But so far, so good. There is firmware update option available.  I checked and my television is already to the latest revision. The manufacturing date is only last month (March 2012), so I guess it can't be too far out of date. It was assembled in Mexico. I registered my television on their web site. It is so new that this model is not even listed yet. But you can type the model number into the apace provided.And the television sensitivity is nothing short of outstanding. I went into my garage and found a compact loop antenna and connected it to the television. The antenna is sitting on the floor on the first level and the nearest television stations are in Houston, 50 miles away.  And it picked up 30 stations. I watched a television program that was obviously a 2D image and turned on the simulated 3D just to see how well it would work.  It definitely depends on the scene, but sometimes it is just almost impressive how well this works. Obviously it is nowhere near as good as a true 3D image, but not too bad, all things considered.The LG 3D image system uses passive polarized glasses. I was pretty much in the active shutter camp until I got this television. I really cannot find any fault with it other than the 3D glasses do attenuate the light somewhat - like polarized sunglasses. The viewing angle is good. I sat on both ends of a long couch and it still looked the same. You can even adjust the amount of 3D effect you desire. Since the glasses are lightweight, I was able to wear my prescription eye glasses and just slipped the 3D glasses over the front.  It works just fine doing it this way. And it was reasonably comfortable, virtually little difference than just wearing my prescription glasses. A few weeks ago, I watched a 3D movie from a very expensive Sony projection setup using active shutter glasses. I think this LG 3D television works just as good (if not better) and without the expense and weight of the active shutter glasses. The active shutter glasses were heavy and I found them quite uncomfortable after about half an hour. And active shutter glasses are very expensive. With this LG television they really do include six pair of 3D glasses. I will not be tempted to buy a projector system because the picture is washed out in comparison to this LG 3D television. The black level is so much better with this LG.I really wish I could have gotten the 55 inch version of this television. I have a 65 inch plasma television upstairs and this 47 inch television is a lot smaller. But while it isn't lightweight, I carried by myself from the bedroom where I assembled it to the living room without much effort. I do suggest you assemble it on a bed with the face down.  The base comes in two pieces. First you mount the two pieces together with 4 screws. Then you mount the two-piece assembly onto the base of the TV with the remaining four screws. The stand seems quite sturdy to me. I tried to tilt it back and forth to test it - plenty stable. You can mount it on a wall, but that hardware is not included, as you would expect.When you find an internet site you want to keep, it does support bookmarking it. And there is a clear history and cookies option, too. It remembers your log-on ID and passwords for Netflix and other sites. Again, I really wish they had included a wireless keyboard and mouse option. The air mouse (remote control) is a little frustrating to use. The pointing accuracy is sometimes really bad. You have to shake the remote while pointing at the center of the screen fairly often to re-center the cursor.  And you will frequently be pointing well past the television set or even at the floor to move the cursor to the desired spot. Maybe I will learn how to use it better with practice. I cannot find any text to tell you how to calibrate it. It appears the documentation is seriously lacking. Maybe they were in a rush to get this on the market and hopefully the documentation is playing catch-up.  But somehow I really doubt that they even considered writing a true user's manual. I consider this a significant issue.I truly wanted to show my loyalty to LG by buying a LG 3D Blu-ray DVD player.  But the specifications and user reviews led me to purchase a Panasonic brand. Unfortunately, the Panasonic is wireless G. That really annoyed me today when I set it up.  At least the LG television is wireless N. I wish LG would have directly listed Amazon Prime streaming video to watch movies. I haven't had a chance to see if I can go to the Amazon web site to play a movie yet. I will update this review as I have more time and experience with this LG 3D television.In summary, I wholeheartedly recommend this 3D television as an excellent television value and technological marvel. I was truly amazed to learn how well they have integrated networking and internet access into this television. Televisions and computers have finally merged with the introduction of this model. The more I used it, the more it felt like a computer with a big screen - yet it is also a very good 3D high definition television.  Almost forgot to mention that there is no bezel surrounding the glass display.  I think that is a major reason I thought it looked smaller. The picture image goes almost to the edge of the glass screen, perhaps to within three-eighths inch from the edge. All I can say is that I am now a 3D believer and LG has designed a very forward looking masterpiece. If you can afford it, I strongly recommend the 55 inch size.", "\"The picture is astounding.  A few friends and I watchedTron: Legacy / Tron: The Original Classic (Five-Disc  Combo: Blu-ray 3D  / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)on this, and althought I love the movie, I couldn't pay attention to the movie the first time through.  I was too busy staring in awe at the way the clouds in the distant background moved, or the beauty of the image.  I was told passive 3D is an image quality drop from HD because it projects half the image to each eye, but I'm calling that theory out.  This picture is glorious.When it upscales images to 3D it can get a little odd.  I watched Naruto on it, and some moments were astounding, and some were just odd, as Naruto's eyes seemed to deepen into layers. Overall, I like the upscale.  It's an approximation of 3D, but it's a darn good approximation.My boyfriend wears huge glasses and these fit over them perfectly.  On a lark, I put them on over my largest sunglasses, and they still fit, so if you wear glasses, even very large glasses, and you have any concerns that they won't work well with these, stop worrying.As to connectors, there is one input for composite in, but it comes with a three-into-one adapter for that.  The same for component in.  Those are the only cable that come with it, so you will need those.  I suggestAmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (9.8 Feet/3.0 Meters) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard] as they are reliable and implement 3D transmission well. There are four specifications for HDMI, 1.4 being the latest, and not every device or cable fully implements the specification.  The signal will downgrade to the lowest component, and with a TV like this, you don't want that component to be your cable.  The difference is substantial.There are four HDMI ports, and it doesn't seem to like connecting to an HDMI switcher. If you have a lot of devices plugged in, and you often find yourself wondering which input the DVD player is using, you'll love this.  First, if a device isn't actively sending a signal, it displays as greyed out, and moves to the back of the list.  Second, you can name your inputs.  You select them from a list (I would have likes to call one Playstation 2, but had to opt for \"\"Game\"\") but it helps a lot.The remote is kind of like a Wii controller.  You wave it around and it points at things on the screen you can select.  Very cute.  If you find it hard to use, back up a few steps.  It's counterintuitive, but it works.  The cursor slows down.For streaming it has the standard YouTube, Netflix and Hulu among others.  The only tiny downside is that it doesn't yet support Amazon on demand videos.  Plug in aRoku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Playerand you're set for streaming entertainment.  I am in the process of replacing my router.  It's in such bad shape that my Pingtest results range from B- to C when connected wirelessly.  Whatever caching the set top does, it can provide perfect clarity even in such adverse conditions.  Good to know if your Internet can have \"\"off moments\"\".The energy star note that came on the TV (the yellow tag required by law that you see on all appliances these days) claims that this TV will have an Estimated Yearly Energy Cost of $14 with a range for similar models (45\"\" - 49\"\" TVs) going from $18 to $51.  This is \"\"Based on 11 cents per kWh and 5 hours use per day.\"\"I wish I could give this 50 stars.  It's perfect.\"", "This is our first smart TV and 3dTV, me and wifey loves it!The picture quality and color is awesome! I'm not a TV enthusiast, but the color and picture quality is really good. I turned of the ECO settings as I find it to dark for me. Wifi setup is zip, just selected my wifi connection, put the password, bam, I'm connected.Before, when we watch netflix, we use PS3 or PC connected to our tv. Now, after turning the TV on, just wait 5~10 secs (until the TV is connected with the wifi), and your good to go.I've seen from other users and from forums, problems like backlight bleeding, flashlighting, restarting, overheating, etc.. So far my unit is OK. No bleeding. No restart, I watched a full movie, and the TV did not restart. No overheating. I touched the back of the TV, near the center, it's pretty warm (the dual core processor must be near center), but it's not burning. Anyway, my TV is less than a week old, I'll post update if ever I encounter any problem.PROS:1. 6 glasses included (other brands included only 2, some higher model include 4)2. Got this TV from amazon with the promotion (free 3d bluray home theater + 6 more glasses)3. Passive glasses - No flicker, no batteries, lightweight and comfortable, cheap glasses4. Very good and vivid picture quality5. 3D is unbelievable6. Slim bezel = sexy!7. Slim TV - Though I was afraid I might crack something while removing from the box because of how slim it is8. Dual core9. 1080p movies in my HDD just look like playing from a bluray disc10. Two player split screen gaming - haven't tried this one yet as I don't have the special glasses, but this is the same feature as Playstation TVCONS:1. Glossy screen = lights and reflections2. Magic motion remote (for me, need time to get used to)3. No pandoraI highly recommended 47LM8600 especially if you can get the promotion.Now I need to buy more 3D bluray shows :)UPDATE:1. Removed #4 in CONS. (4. Sometimes sound becomes loud and then goes back to normal when watching 3D. Not sure if this is a problem with the John Carter 3D bluray that I watched. Will update after watching more 3D shows)- Just turn off the 3D sound zooming in the 3D settings, and the sound will not go loud intermittently. :)", "I've said it before, and I'll say it again. I'm not very technical when it comes to rating electronics, but I know what I like. Here are the likes:- The 3D glasses: Compared to my other (Samsung) 3D glasses which are active, these passive glasses are much more comfortable. There are no worries about the batteries dying mid-movie and there is no annoying flutter in my peripheral vision. They are just as effective, too. And, of course, the price is much better. The TV is in my bedroom so I'll probably never need six pairs of glasses. (Insert crude jokes here.)- The picture: Gorgeous. Both Blu-ray movies and HD TV look beautiful and crisp. I have Time Warner cable and the TV and cable work together beautifully. I've watched 3D Blu-ray movies, too, and have absolutely no complaints.- The internet: Looks great but it's hard to maneuver to sites due to the tedious input method. (Below)- The look: Nice and sleek. I wasn't happy with the stand and have since mounted the TV on a wall. (Don't try to do this yourself -- it's REALLY heavy!!)- Audio is okay for being built-in. My living room TV's audio passes through an amplifier and has surround sound; this is fine for the bedroom.What I don't like:- TiVo has an app called THX optimizer. I was unable to do much with it since the TV's menu covered the background. It was impossible to make adjustments since I couldn't see the background. It would be nice if the box containing the menu items could be moved to the side somehow.- The remote: It may be the worst remote I've ever used, and probably the one thing that takes away a star. It's hard to keep steady and is very similar to a Wii remote. Most options are reached through the menu -- the remote itself has very few buttons. So, for example, to set the sleep timer takes several steps. It's also difficult to point to the letters when inputting information on internet sites. Because of that, I rarely surf the internet on the TV. Don't feel bad for me; I have enough other options. The remote is also very sensitive and the mute button is easily accidentally activated.", "\"For my needs, this was an excellent buy. I imagine I would have been equally happy with the 55LM7600, but it was not in stock at my local MicroCenter where these are selling at insanely good prices. There are of course a few things to consider before you decide to buy this TV:Will the TV be situated in a basement, Or is most of your TV viewing done in dim lighting, Or do you care more about picture quality than brightness? If yes, get a plasma. If not, move on to the next question.Will you rarely be watching 3D content? If yes, get a Samsung 2D or even 3D TV. If not, move on to the next question.Do you live in a home with lots of storage space and outlets to keep 3D glasses charged (i.e. not a cramped NY apartment), and do you expect not to have more than 6-8 people watching 3D movies at the same time? If yes, get a Samsung 3D TV. If not, read on.If you came this far after the questions, as I did, this is the right TV for you. You might also be happy with the 55LM7600.What you should be prepared for:1. Ghosting and Flash-lighting. These defects are manifest in all edge-lit LED TVs. My previous TV is a Vizio XVT3D474SV, which was a back-lit TV. It had no flashlighting, but still had noticeable ghosting, though not as bad as this LG unit. These defects are most noticeable when watching a dark movie (think dark knight), or a movie with cinema black bars on the top and bottom. For most content, when sitting a brightly lit room, the defects are not noticeable at all. The same issue affects top of the line Samsung TVs as well.2. Poor black levels. The black levels on this TV are nowhere near the black levels on my previous Vizio TV. If you calibrate the TV for deeper black levels, brightness suffers as well. LG displays are poorer than Samsung displays in this regard. A properly calibrated Samsung TV gets both better black levels and a brighter display than the corresponding calibrated LG TV.So why would you still buy this TV:1. Very good looking. TV looks great both on and off. It has such a thin bezel that the width and height are almost the same as the 47\"\" Vizio XVT3D474SV that it replaced.2. In a brightly lit living room (which mine is), you will love the brightness and picture quality of this TV for most programming. Its only marginally worse than a Samsung TV having similar features. While videophiles would differ, I like the bright, vibrant colors on this TV much better than that of my backlit Vizio. Yes, blacks are not as deep and there is uneven flashlighting along the top edge, but the picture just feels so much better.3. Audio is much better than my previous TV, though this doesn't matter to me since I have an external Vizio bar and subwoofer that produce much better sound. But you could get by with just the inbuilt speakers. The only issue is that I now need separate remotes for the TV and sound control, so I ended up buying a Logitech harmony. I never liked the magic remote much anyway. It was very annoying whenever the mouse pointer turned up on screen when moving the remote by mistake, and what kind of remote doesn't have a dedicated input button?4. 3D is truly usable and excellent. A relative who swears by Samsung was blown away by the quality of 3D on this TV. The half-HD issue with passive 3D TVs is really a non-issue. Glasses are very lightweight and easy/cheap to replace. I don't have to worry about the kids breaking them. Nothing to recharge. Being an IPS display, 3D looks good even from wide angles. I recently watched Hugo in 3D, having previously seen it in 2D, and the experience is incomparable. The 3D in my previous TV was active-3D, and the heavy flickering glasses gave me a headache, and I never bothered recharging them after they ran out. I know the newer Samsung glasses are very lightweight and are rated at 70 hours per charge, but with a toddler around and never having enough outlets, its still a major entry barrier for me. I might consider active 3D again if they design TVs such that the glasses can be docked behind the TV.5. Excellent value. This unit set me back 12 benjamins at MC. A Samsung 3D TV with similar features was much more expensive at the time of this writing. Expense has never been the sole reason for me to choose a TV, but it definitely helps when the TV you choose based on features is also a great value.6. You can 'throw' youtube videos from your smartphone (Android/iPhone) to the TV. Probably useless for many, but very useful for me. All the other apps on the TV are redundant since I also have a Roku and PS3, but the youtube feature alone makes the 'smart' capability worthwhile.The only feature I really miss compared to my previous TV (Vizio XVT3D474SV) is the ability to connect a bluetooth stereo headset. I got so used to this on the Vizio during those occasional late night gaming sessions using my PS3 while my toddler slept in the next room. I didn't realize this feature wasn't there until after I bought the TV. I just assumed since the remote was bluetooth a bluetooth headset would be supported as well. Sadly I was wrong. A little research also showed that the XVT3D was more of an outlier with such features and most modern TVs still don't have even half the features that it did 2 years ago. I do enjoy 3D gaming more now, so I guess you still really can't have everything.Overall, this was a great purchase for me. Definitely recommend, provided you have similar circumstances.-------------------Update 2/1/2014: Over a year now and still going strong. I have since mounted the TV on my wall and I can appreciate the slimness much better. Its also very lightweight for its size, which made me less nervous about mounting it on the metal studs in my rental unit.One gotcha with this device is that it does not pass-through 5.1 surround sound from the HDMI input to the SPDIF audio output, so you need to choose a home theater system with a HDMI switch that extracts audio from source. Alternatively, you can use a HDMI switch with audio extractor, which is what I am using with my SONOS Playbar.A new welcome feature with Android devices is the ability to cast Netflix and Youtube videos to the TV without having to enter any codes to pair the TV to the Android device first. If you are planning to buy a Chromecast for this feature only, you don't have to. The TV does it just as well. Even better if you are in a highrise, since you can hook up the TV with ethernet and you can't do that with the Chromecast. My Chromecast is highly prone to interference since it does not work on the 5GHz band and the 2.4GH band is super-crowded and interference-prone.\"", "\"LG is one of the top electronics makers out there and they make great products. I'll be comparing this TV to my Samsung 46C8000Samsung UN46C8000 46-Inch 1080p 3D 240 Hz LED HDTV. I have read that it takes brand new TV's a little time to break in and most will need further calibration later. My review is for the last few days of using it and will update in in a few months. I'm no expert but just have a passion for great picture quality and try to do research online to help my reviews.The design of the TV is great. The image almost goes to the edge of the screen. It reminds me of the new Apple iMacs. The TV, is of course very thin, and unlike my Samsung there is more metal in the body of the unit. The layout of the HDMI and other ports are in the same spot on the left (when viewing the TV). After unboxing the TV, you have to attache an attachment that screws to the tv itself. After doing that you can attach it to the stand, which I had problems with on the inner left corner, the screw just didn't want to catch. I finally got it though but there may be a manufacturing issue with the drill hole.After getting the TV all plugged in and situated, I started the initial setup which was very, very easy. There is a great step by step guide that walks you thru the process using the \"\"Magic Motion Remote\"\" (which i'll get to later), and also gets you setup on your wifi too. Once the setup was done I began viewing some shows that I watch all the time to get a sense of the picture quality to begin my calibration. Out of the box the settings wer ok but definitely needed some adjustments. If you have any THX labeled dvd, there is an audio/video calibration test that does a decent job to get you started in calibration. So, after I did the tests, I did some final tweaking to get it to where I was happy with.In comparison to the color and sharpness of my Samsung, for this review purpose, I'll rate the Samsung as a 10 and give the LG an 8. I'm sure the TV can be tweaked more by a professional but most of us like to do it ourselves and do not want to pay someone. The samsung is definitely sharper and had better overall skin tones. It also did NOT suffer from compression distortion from the signal. I have Directv and use a good HDMI plug that gave me great quality on the Samsung. I do notice that on the LG that faces have a slight blur to them especially in the eyes and also most text looks jagged. The Samsung out of the box had a much sharper image but needed a few days worth of tweaking to really get the picture quality perfect for my liking. The LG was a little easier in that regard but I can say that the Samsung's image quality does still look better to me. I will continue to make adjustments as I see fit during the TV break-in. There is a built in \"\"Picture Wizard\"\" that guides you through the process to calibrate your TV but I found that in my opinion I still needed to really tweak it more using the expert setting where you can really get in there and change each color value specifically like reds, green, blue, magenta, cyan, yellow, green.For audio, there are many settings too like virtual surround etc. I liked that unlike my samsung that has a mono speaker on the back of the unit, LG has stereo speakers on the very bottom and gives it a much better sound. It does make the unit stick out further if your wall hanging because they stick out, but only slightly, most won't even notice his. The over all sound is ok, its no 5.1 or 7.1 but most would understand that.The Magic Motion Remote....well if you've played a Wii, its almost the same exact thing. The remote is just like moving the Wii controller with the arrow pointer to where you want to go/select on the screen. It takes time to get used to and I found that it wandered around the screen making me point it to the floor or ceiling to reach the top or bottom of the screen. I believe your supposed to shake it around to re calibrate the positioning. The select button on the remote is like a mouse wheel and I found it to be too small for my finger and it doesn't really feel like a button so half the time i'm pressing it, it didn't work. I also find that if you put the remote on the sofa near you and you move the motion will activate the mouse (being it works on motion) and then you get the big arrow pointer in the middle of your screen. It gets very frustrating when this happens. I also found that when I was adjusting the image quality you have to keep moving the remote to keep it active or it will time out and you have to start all over again. I much preferred LG's user interface its very Apple iOS inspired and very easy to figure out.There are also set settings that you can tweak a little but I always go right for custom. There is also an option if your a gamer where you can have 2 players play separate screens using a special pair of glasses that are NOT included.3D....even though i've complained a little about the color not being up to MY likings, the 3D is very, very good!. I watch the 3D all the time on my Samsung and there is always ghosting and the battery powered glasses make everything much darker. The LG glasses are lightweight and light tinted. No battery either! you can even use some of the movie theater glasses and it will work. The kit comes with 6 pairs and they are so comfortable not only on your face but on your eyes. I tested them out with Avatar and did a comparison with the Samsung and while they were close, the winner in my opinion was the LG. Reasons were that the glasses didn't make the movie darker and that they were lightweight and you don't see that flicker that the active glasses give. The tv also has links to online movies that are free for various 3D shows, most were underwater ones but they are fun to watch. My Directv has a few channels that are 100% 3D and are great to watch. Oh and unlike the active glasses you do not have to be right in the center of the tv to get the full effect. The LG passive glasses let you sit almost anyplace the tv is viewable and you still get the effect.LG has a ton of apps and other streaming content via wifi or wired. It has all the usual netflix, Facebook, hulu stuff so if you have accounts then your set. Blu-Rays looked amazing on this TV too. Although I watch more satellite tv, the blu-ray's really did look stunning and if your more a movie buff you'll be very happy. There also a ton of options for this Smart Tv including photo albums, and connecting your tablet, pc, mac, usb drive to the tv.The manual was not really a manual. It had no descriptions of all the hundreds of functions and adjustments this TV has on it. What is trumotion or what is mpeg de-noise? Some of us know what they are but many do not and would like to have the manual in front of you to read what things do while making adjustments. There are descriptions of all of these things in one of the onscreen apps. It breaks everything down for you and some of the selections even have a pop out bubble with the info but for me I don't want to have to go thru menu's and screens to find something and then have to go back to another menu to implement the adjustment. I like having the manual in front of me so I can work simultaneously.If your looking for a brand new tv with all the bells and whistles and that has amazing 3D with passive glasses, I think that you will be super pleased with this TV. You will have to do a little calibration on the picture quality but its quite easy.Pros:Super thinSleek modern designExcellent 3D and passive glassesDecent stereo speakersLots of options for picture controlWireless and wired WiFiTons of apps and customizable channels for streamingBlu-Ray movies look superVery energy efficient (5 hrs per day is said to cost only $14 per year to run)Cons:Color calibration takes timeMagic Motion remote is a bit of a pain (should be both a regular remote and have the option to be MagicColors on some shows especially non HD channels look muddyText at times can look pixelated\"", "\"It should be noted that I have neither owned an LED HDTV or a 3D HDTV before, thus this review will be from the perspective of a novice user and free of the technical jargon found in other \"\"expert\"\" reviews.  With that out of the way, my initial impression upon unboxing the unit was that it was sleek in design and extremely thin (roughly an inch in depth!).  The screen has a glossy finish associated with plasma TVs instead of the matte finish found on most LCD TVs.  I actually prefer the matte finish as it eliminates much of glare from rooms with various light sources.  As it is, to truly appreciate the rich picture quality of this TV, it should be situated in a room that is as close to a dark environment as possible.  A minor quibble, but still worth noting considering the high-end nature of this unit.  Mounting the TV to the stand with the included screws was a breeze and the initial onscreen setup after powering up the unit for the first time was also smooth.  In my first week of usage, I began to notice a bizarre \"\"ghosting\"\" or picture lagging effect during panning shots and fast motion (especially dimly lit sequences) when viewing blu-rays, as well as satellite transmissions (each on separate inputs).  I knew that this was highly unusual given the 240hz refresh rate so I immediately contacted LG customer service and after some troubleshooting tips via the phone, I was put in contact with a local LG technician who came to my house within 2 weeks.  He suspected a faulty mainboard (an issue with some previous LG LED models) and quickly replaced it with a brand new one.  Unfortunately, the problem persisted, and I was informed that the issue was not with the unit but instead with the equipment that I had hooked up to it, which simply was not technically adequate given the advanced specs of the TV.  He recommended upgrading from theMediabridge Ultra Series High Speed HDMI Cablethat I was using to a more high speed one.  Given the costly retail prices of such high-end TVs, I do not know why companies refuse to supply HDMI cables, are at the very least, offer up suggestions for HDMI cables that are best suited for a particular unit.  The technician also recommended that I upgrade myPanasonic DMP-BD75 Blu-ray Disc Playerto a 3D player that could output at a higher refresh rate, as well.  ***Please see the end of this review for an update to this problem***As far as the rest of the TV's features, the remote control is perhaps the most glaring difference.  It is best described as a cross between a Wii game console controller and a computer mouse.  It is motion sensitive with very little actual buttons to push.  Much of the functions are performed by an onscreen cursor which one uses to navigate through the various menus, much to the chagrin of this reviewer's old-fashioned tastes.  While I eventually adjusted to the radical differences with this \"\"magic remote,\"\" I found the incredible motion sensitivity of the remote to be rather frustrating.  The slightest jostling of the remote results in a cursor appearing on the screen, where it will remain until the remote is kept absolutely motionless for 5 seconds.  This means that if one has the remote on the bed or the couch, the slightest movement will cause the cursor to appear right in the middle of the screen.  Why LG did not think of a way to disable this feature or at least not make it so sensitive to motion is a mystery.  As far as the actual 3D aspects, let me begin by stating that the 3D glasses are virtually identical to the 3D glasses used in movie theaters.  Made of lightweight plastic and slightly dark lenses that almost give the impression of wearing sunglasses, it is easy to forget that one is even wearing them.  The upconversion from 2D to 3D is done though the push of a button on the remote, at which time an onscreen menu appears with a several selectable choices in 3D effects, depending on the source material (blu-ray, satellite, video games, etc.).  The 3D effect is best when viewing movies with bold colors and brightly lit scenes.  My viewing ofThe Dark Knightblu-ray added little to the viewing experience given the drab colors and dark visuals of the film.  In contrast, though, theBack to the Futureblu-ray simply looked amazing.  The lightning effects of the Delorean as it reached 88mph were remarkable and the shots of Hill Valley in the daylight had a feeling of depth that has to be seen to be fully appreciated.  While the 3D upconverion is not up to par with most 3D movies found in theaters or a 3D blu-ray disc played on actual 3D blu-ray player, it is still a nice treat to be able to view new and classic movies in a different light.As impressive as the 3D feature is, I must confess that I have used it less and less over time.  The reason is a combination of not wanting to wear glasses all the time but also the stunning clarity of the 2D image!  I did not think it would be so noticeable but it is worlds above my 3-year old 1080p Sharp LCD HDTV.  The black levels are indeed black and not the dark grey seen with LCD TVs and the colors are rich, vibrant, and as true to life as I have ever seen it.  This unit also upconverts the picture quality of DVDs quite nicely by eliminating much of the video noise and heavy pixelation that are noticeable when viewing DVDs on a 1080p HDTV.  My blu-rays movies have also never looked better, to the point where I am noticing things for the very first time.  While watching the aforementioned Back to the Future blu-ray, I was amazed at how I could clearly see the subtle color variations between Doc Brown's old-age make-up and his actual skin tone.  LG definitely delivers on its promise of seeing \"\"details and colors like never before.\"\"  It goes without stating that the various picture and sound controls should be adjusted to match one's personal tastes as the original factory settings are far from optimal.  I chose to minimize the TruMotion feature as leaving it on at the original setting caused the picture to look \"\"sped up\"\", almost to the point where the movement of people seemed to look like it was shot with a camcorder.  The sound is also great, but I would not state that it was as much improved from my previous LCD TV as the picture quality.  It is also worth mentioning that the actual physical manual that accompanies this unit only contains basic installation instructions and tips.  The explanations of the various picture and audio settings must be accessed through an onscreen user guide.  While this was a nice way to save on paper, it is also frustrating as one has to scroll through various screens to find out details on particular features and then exit out of the menu screens and then go into the picture/sound settings to make any adjustments.  Quite frustrating for those who may not have the best memory or would simply prefer a traditional paper manual that one could read while simultaneously making any changes.  There are also various apps that are installed on this unit, but I only accessed a few of them.  Accessing and navigating through the apps were quite easy and free from any technical glitches so far.Overall, LG has lived up to almost all of its selling points with this unit.  The TV is sleek and stylish, the 3D is quite impressive, and the truly amazing clarity of the 2D picture is perhaps the most surprising aspect for this reviewer.  The only real cons were the magic remote (which some will take to more easily than others), the glare-prone glossy screen, the onscreen manual (again, user preferences vary), and the \"\"ghosting\"\" effect during fast motion which hopefully will be resolved once I upgrade to better hardware.****UPDATE 6/16/12***I have since updated to aLG BP620 3D Blu-Ray Player Built-In Wi-Fialong withMonster Ultimate High Speed HDMI 1000 HDX cablesand, much to my dismay, the \"\"ghosting\"\" effect during fast motion persisted.  I once again called LG and another technician was sent to inspect my TV.  This technician determined that the problem was most likely a hardware issue with this model and not a result of my particular configuration.  When he telephoned his supervisor about a possible solution, he was instructed to tell me to \"\"sit 11 feet from the unit as stated in the manual\"\" and that would somehow magically resolve the problem!  In other words, LG had no hardware or firmware fix for this particular issue and was simply looking to offer me a token resolution.  The technician stated that he wished he could offer up \"\"a real fix\"\" but LG had to take the initiative to investigate the issue, and that would only happen if they received enough complaints, which could take an indefinite amount of time.  He also cautioned that the next version of this particular model (theLG Cinema Screen 55LM9600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 480 Hz Dual Core Nano LED HDTV) would most likely have even worse fast motion \"\"ghosting\"\" since it has twice the refresh rate, and the problem was not resolved with my particular model before putting its successor on the market.  So, despite the vastly impressive specs, I simply cannot recommend this unit given the quality control issues that should have been addressed long before this model (or its successor) was ever put on the market.  If LG ever offers an actual solution via a firmware update or hardware fix, I shall update this review once more.\"", "This gorgeous LG 47 inch model equipped with an array of great features arrived packed well and protected in a very portable box.It actually fit in my Accord easily despite its' considerable size.All accesories were packed easy to find,and assembly was a matter of seconds! The stand is stylish and supports the elegant thin TV in a good way.A phillips head did the stand assembly in in minutes.The stand swings easily , so accessing the back of the TV to insert cables was a cinch.The programming is a breeze,so setup was minutes,including the wireless connection.The last TV I set up the Panasonic Viera was much harder to resolve connection hurdles.The web surfing is fast and accurate.The apps are plenty.The stand is sleek and simple.The very sleek border  is not reflective,and that sets it apart from the more annoying reflective ones that are on the scene now.The sound is really good! I am excited that the apps are so plentiful and the range of uses makes this Smart tv a real gem.The color is breath taking without adjustments or tweeking.The high definition is astounding!The remote is rather clumsy and might be better off including a key board.It is difficult typing for the web surfing.I find the 47 inch screen to really compliment my simple ten by fourteen foot bedroom.All in all I am crazy about this great television with features that work intuitively and cleanly,just like the great design that LG showcases here.I advise those who want an extremely versatile product as this one to take the plunge.It is that refreshing!I do wonder if the thin models are as durable as those that were a bit more massive in thickness.I love the web surfing,the great picture and the design that makes my room look great.Do not use the energy saver! It will compromise the color too much and cause it to darken!!The three D glasses need no batteries,and do work incredibly to bring just one more great feature to vivid life!"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.00033250765409320593, 0.1770378053188324, 0.0001471363939344883, 0.015066164545714855, 0.14464840292930603, 0.16024205088615417, 0.24186375737190247, 0.0002737912582233548, 0.0002544675662647933, 0.000959196244366467, 0.05432749167084694, 0.0029458405915647745, 0.0008781521464698017, 0.2010231763124466]]}
