The Secret World by Fun Com is a very enjoyable game, I've spent two days so far playing it and I love it. The music is good, story is good, and overall gameplay and combat is good, I can't find anything at fault. The game is buy to play which means that you only pay for the client and all future updates are free, but there is an completely optional subscription fee if you're feeling generous which doesn't affect gameplay at all.I've played Fun Com's Age Of Conan MMORPG which I didn't like but The Secret World is more than passable.The Secret World is a very capable MMORPG, it suffered a poor launch but with recent updates and the pricing model changed it's starting to get a near decent population again. As a long time gamer, MMORPG veteran and Amazon customer I highly recommend this game. Come into The Secret World for thrilling adventures and mystery!", "\"Funcom as a developer has had a somewhat checkered history among gamers.  While Anarchy Online, its earlier title, had a strong yet small following, Age of Conan disappointed many due to its premature release, which was reflected in a lack of content and many bugs in various game systems.  So, to be quite honest, I didn't expect anything in particular at all from The Secret World, other than perhaps a better version of The Matrix Online.Well.Funcom has created a secret masterpiece.  The Secret World is an MMO which, in many ways, reflects the desires of MMO fans who have been playing the genre for 10+ years, and want something different from yet another clone of World of Warcraft.  And this game delivers that, on pretty much all levels.The gameplay is reminiscent of other 3D MMOs, yet the action system is different, being based on synergies between skills and weapon choices.  The game affords the player the flexibility to choose their own skills in whatever way they wish -- which also allows players to mess up their decisions with an old school approach of having to live with one's mistakes in this regard.  As a result, the game has a steep learning curve, but rewards players who want more complexity in their MMO experience as compared with most of the offerings since 2004.The mechanics of the game involve the familiar quest system, yet in TSW the focus is very, very heavy on story telling (even more than in TOR, the first MMO to focus heavily on story telling .. and it has quite better writing than TOR does as well).  And quest design is not monolithic.  There are storyline quests and main quests and then side quests -- and the main quests can be either combat, investigation (puzzle solving) or sabotage (stealth) in nature.  This makes for a very diverse gameplay set as compared with almost any other 3D MMO.  Quests advance in \"\"tiers\"\", and the story focus is underscored by a strict limit on the kind and number of quests one can be \"\"working on\"\" at any one time (gone are the days of going to a quest hub, loading up on its quests, and powerleveling through them to \"\"level as efficiently as possible\"\" -- you are following stories here that have their own pace).  And speaking of leveling -- there are no levels, either, but rather Action Points (used to purchase new abilities) and Skill Points (used to upgrade abilities in weapons and armor slots) which are rewarded based on experience and certain quest completion.  The player can allocate these in any way they wish (there are no set classes), although research is recommended to optimize one's choice -- in that sense, the degree of complexity and prep required is moving in the direction of EVE Online, although not nearly as complex as EVE is.I will say this, however.  If you are looking for a light-hearted pew-pew type game, this is not that.  If you don't want to invest time to learn the game's systems (which are not really like the familiar MMO systems), you won't like this game.  If you are looking for another game where you can rush to max level and look around \"\"to see what the endgame is like\"\", then you won't like it either.  As a result, I believe this is a niche game, similar in that respect as well to EVE Online -- a game that will appeal to a certain segment of gamers, but not the \"\"mass market\"\" of MMO gamers like WoW or TOR or GW2.So... if you're a bit of an experienced and jaded MMO gamer who is looking for something a bit different, a bit more complex, and quite a bit less mainstream, give TSW a try.  It's a great game for people who are looking for the kind of experience it offers.\"", "The Secret World could've been improved in a dozen little ways, but it still stands apart as an MMO that is not only a uniquely enjoyable setup, but it actually makes you use your brain to solve quests.The general storyline is awesome. Across 3 starting guilds (The Templar, Illuminatti, and the Dragon) you're a normal human thrust into a world of magic and mystery, spanning Heaven and Hell and the realms of the Dark Gods and the Other. You're conscripted/recruited by your guild of choice, and packed off into the wonderland behind the veil of the real world.The system is classless, meaning you can literally be whatever you please. Grinding is almost non-existant. You may play over the same area doing multiple quests, but I never had to mob monsters to get a level. Quests are scaled to provide enough experience to make it, but not make it easy.And quests are unique, inventive, and genuinely exciting. Red herrings abound as you struggle to crack a puzzle or subtle hint as to the next phase of the mystery you are exposing yourself too. Or go out and collect ammo for survivors and fight hordes of the undead. Fetch and slay quests are still present, but the mysterys are by far the best. You actually use an in-game browser to search for clues, crack passwords, and research famous historical and fake-historical figures and places. I've never had so much fun being frustrated by trying to figure out a nerd fan boys password bsed on his love of a fake horror novel serial.Graphics are a solid C-. Your torso turns so much as you psuedo skate across the landscape it looks like you should be able to hear your spine wailing in protest while you scream in terro at looking like you're going to shoot off a cliff like a hockey puck. Monsters later on appear cripser and more realistic, not to mention more visceral and gross, but overall they could've done better. Environments are a B+, with hidden findable items in at least logical locations, hidden passageways, and otherwise confusing and maze-like worlds, which I actually enjoy, as unless you're in a city, you shouldn't have quests at 3rd and main street.Audio is great, just for characters. Its actually worht it going back to lower level areas to play through the side-story of the native american shamanic chosen one whos a 16 year old high school girl who's more interested in playing her game boy than fighting a wendigo.Connectivity is a little dicey. I wasn't on the best connection in the world, but lag problems abounded at times, though to be fair I was at the mass opening, so the deluge has certainly petered off.Equipment is kind of a puzzle, and well fabrication is far more worthwhile, is still far too strange for me to figure out. Basically pick your two favorite weapons and try to group periodically. If your group mates are doing double your damage, its time to upgrade. But luckilly, this has never been a real issue for me, as you get scaled equipment often enough for it to be obvious what you should be using.PVP is awful. Unless you have purple equipment, it's not even worth the attempt until you're at maximum level.Overall, its a tragedy Funcom is taknig a bath on this. Some more polish on graphics, full voice acting for male/female main players, and this would be five stars. As it is, the uniqueness of the setup and the engaging main storyline pull this up from 3 to 4 and manage to keep it there. If I hade more money to burn, this would've been worth a lifetiome subscription.", "Wow, am I sick of zombies! I didn't even like zombies before they became the latest gaming craze.What do TSW zombies do? Yep, you guessed it! They chase you around in packs while waving their arms in the air and making wet growling noises with their mouths. Oh yeah, and of course they can tear you to shreds by doing this.You may like the game. I didn't, and I tried. Oh, did I ever try. It's just... boring.It's pretty but it's got some uuuuugly women. Ugly, like on the level of Rift ugly! Don't even try to make one pretty. It won't work. Either make a male character or go ahead and see just how ugly of a female character you can make.It isn't hard, game developers. Look at Aion. That game is how old now? Have you ever seen a game (before or since) with that level of detail and customization options capable of producing female characters that rival the beauty of most REAL girls?Didn't think so. Get your acts together. No more ugly women!", "This game is really tailored towards a certain type of person. If you like deep, complex puzzles and solid RPGs then you may fit into this category. Check it out.", "Happy i got it for only $15 and now theres no need for monthly subscription pay so its the best deal out!", "This game has untried concepts and an interesting appeal, but the mechanics are a little pretentious and the game is kind of boring to be honest. The story essentially forces you to partake in every dialog to even comprehend what is happening in the game, which is a cardinal sin of MMORPG, in my opinion. It's a half-decent game with a bit of boring bits and ridiculously high specs for a game that looks this bad...don't upgrade for this game.", "\"The Secret World is an ok game... the problem is though is that it feels more like a \"\"single player\"\" setup rather then a MMO world. unlike most other MMO worlds where the world is seamless and you can travel from one point to the next this game features areas as \"\"maps\"\" so you have to go to a hub to travel from one map to the next....and while that has worked in other MMOs like Star Trek Online...it did as such by at least making you feel like you were still part of a overall universe, with maps/star charts etc.  But th is game just feels....first of all the new york city hub is boring. the map doesnt even have any markers or info on them unlike the london map. second of all while london seems more interesting then new york is.. it just does not feel like a \"\"hub city\"\"  its only part of london a very small part. and doesnt even have big ben or anything like that. would think for a online game it would be nice if one of the hubs had big ben or another london landmark you can run by and sit and chat with others near....second of all i think the whole system is not as open as youd like. yeah there are no levels. but technically there are behind the scenes you just skill up ..and technically you dont \"\"play how you want\"\" its still a sort of grindy mmo where to get anywhere you gotta do quests and hunt bad guys.also the whole pick your weapon and your spells thing is kinda lame as well.  and you only get like a few small choices of weapons,  at the start.  and it was confusing to me to figure out how to switch from them to the spellsi think a starter class type would have been nice to start out with . you pick your first class what you want and then later on you can fine tune it ... it just is a little confusing in thatand the wheel. the wheel is overwhelimg at first and hard to see on 720p i  think that system is just too complex for newcomers. they should have just toned it down to start with then opened it up later on.also i dont like that there is no real anti allasing support. there are a few options but it does not get rid of the jaggies which is bad because it ends up making the game not look that greatkinda distracting when you have a nice world and then you see jaggie lines and all everywhere.it just to me doesnt feel like a big MMO.  it feels more confinedand the server i was on the pubs and what felt empty the only crowd i really saw was in the teleport hubit didnt feel like a real city half of the shops had nothing in it for you at least in stormwind in wow most of the places had things people were running around it felt alivethis game just feels like something is missingalso the biggest thing isyou pay 40 bucks for the game.. you have to pay a monthly fee it is NOT free to play andthey have a store in it already where you can add real world funds to by items and clothingand im like really?they should put all that stuff in the in game shops using in game money ..  and promise to add more stuff each monthbecause otherwise what are you really paying for each month?thats just poor doings and i do not like that.the game is so so . the combat is OK.. but its sometimes hard to figure out what you are shooting at and its not real time combat so it feels a tad clunky in that regaurd.having full voice and cutscenes for quests is nicebut honeslty half of the cutscenes are stupid and not really that great.. the old republic was more intertaining that way.though nice to see more voice acting being put into mmmosbottom line: its a nice game to try out for a weekend but just something that to me isnt worth a long term investment considering there are so many great free to play mmos out there already with so much content its crazy.i rather spend money on that then on a game i already paid for and pay a monthly fee on!\"", "\"Edit: Removing a star because not only did they actually find a way to increase how often the game crashes (It crashes every 3 hours or so now instead of a couple times a day) but the people at end game are really stupid. They expect you to have significantly better gear than can possibly drop in the instance you are running, meaning you would have no reason to run that instance in the first place. While I realize Funcom has no control over this and it has been an MMO trend in the past couple years, there is no real \"\"progression\"\" content in this game. It isn't just like you can join a guild and wait for new content to come out. The Nightmare modes are it... and people expect you to have the best gear available in game, which comes from badges you get from running those same instances over and over, to run them in the first place. It makes no sense, but that is MMOs for you.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit: I received an e-mail from FunCom today stating that The Secret World is now free to play. (with initial game purchase) As I stated in my initial review, this game is a lot of fun and definitely worth the 1 time purchase.I am adding a star for now and will be giving it it's 5th star later if I find they have fixed the glitches. I bought it directly on their website if you are wondering why I'm not showing as an Amazon purchase. I do not recommend doing that because their credit card verification seems painfully slow and you can't play until it is verified.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ok... first of all I am playing the 5 day trial and recommend you do the same before purchasing this. I gave it 3 stars, but it is more like 5 stars in some aspects 1 star in others. When you start out it gives you weapon choices. It allows you to test them, but since it only lets you use the basic abilities for that weapon you don't get any idea how the gameplay works for each weapon tree. Unfortunately it is important, because there is no \"\"respec\"\" but rather as you level you get more and more points, so whichever you choose is what your stuck with unless you want to waste a lot of points changing weapon tree. I recommend you spend an hour or so looking at \"\"decks\"\" (Which are premade ability combos for later in the game) and abilities in each weapon type as well.There is a lot to like about this game. Interesting gameplay, flexible skill combinations, lots control over how you play, etc. It starts out a bit boring, but the more you level the more fun it gets.The main problem with this game is the overwhelming amount of glitches. It is common for a group member to just not be able to get into the same instance version as you. There is no way to fix that since there is no instance reset option, it is supposed to be automatic but doesn't work correctly. Not even disbanding and reforming will fix it... there is just no way to run the instance when it glitches unless you want to 4-man it.  After a few hours of solo questing (After a frustrating group disband) the problem just seems to go away on its own.It is common for a quest to glitch out in one of a couple different ways and be impossible to complete. Sometimes you don't get quest credit when you complete something but the item still is no longer clickable as though it was complete... so you just cant get to the next step. Sometimes an item just isn't respawning. Etc. No way to abandon a quest and even picking up a new one only pauses that one... so you just sort of have to hope that fixes itself later and come back to it.Aside from glitches the game only lets you pick up one \"\"main\"\" quest (stories and whatnot) and three \"\"side\"\" quests. (Mainly random items you find.) The problem with this is you will often have to run back and forth across the entire zone for one quest then have to do it again and again for each individual quest since you can't do them all at once. Also the side quests are usually found in random places in the middle of nowhere, so if you \"\"pause\"\" one to pick up another you need to find that old quest to do it. (Paused quests don't stay in journal.)As for quest content, most are fairly fun, but others are literally impossible to do without looking stuff up in a search engine. (A real search engine, that isn't just an in game thing.) You are supposed to look up stuff from all kinds of places and solve puzzles based on info you find (The Bible, information on painters, random historical figures, etc.) Honestly its easier to just look up the solution. And some you can't even look up, you just have to know random things or directly look up the answer. Do you know morse code? Because for one quest you have to translate beeps in an audio recording in order to find the coordinates you need to go to. There are also some quest areas that I swear are there to troll you. For example there are moth creatures that call every single moth in the area to swarm you, which is just impossible to defeat, so you basically have to corpse crawl your way through a forest of these things.Finally graphics. i don't really know what to say about them, they are just very varied. Some things look amazing and have ultra realistic detail while other things look like automated level design or just really poorly done with that molded plastic look.The fact is if this were a one time purchase I would say it is worth the full new game price. But it is a subscription pay MMO... which costs a lot in the long run. I don't know what \"\"end game\"\" is like. (By the way your level is determined by gear which you need enough skill points in that piece to wear, so end game would be highest level gear.) But honestly with all the odd glitches I can't say this is worth a subscription. In a 5 day trial I also climbed through 5 gear levels and there are only 10. (Although there are 10.2, 10.4, etc after that.) And cleared 3/8 instances in the game as well as acquired all the damage/healing role skills I will ever actually need. So honestly other than playing around with new builds and collecting skills you don't really need I can't see there being much to do once you clear everything on \"\"elite\"\" mode. So in closing I would love to buy this game if there were not a subscription or it was significantly lower, but I just can't justify paying $30-50 to activate the game then paying $144-180 a year to play it...\"", "First off, I'm a casual gamer. I liked rpg style games, but I'm kind of sick of the fantasy rpg's. If you are sick of the fantasy story lines then buy this game. This game has an EXTREMELY good story. There were times when I was playing a quest and I just wanted to give the writers a hug for being that darn good at story telling. The investigation missions are very challenging and sometimes I had to look up the cheat and I never felt bad because I would have never figured it out. I have friends that have played all the missions with no help at all though. So it's doable. I would say this game generally attracts and keeps the more mature players playing. Most of the cabal that I have joined are mothers, fathers and well into 30s and 40s of age. This is a good thing though. It makes the chat channels less cluttered with children being immature. The leveling system is different. You don't level. You get experience, but they get you your stat and ability points. Stat points will get you into better gear, and ability points will get you new abilities.I saw a bunch of reviews where people said that the game doesn't give any instructions on how to play. This is entirely not true. Most of the missions have a quest helper tool that will even show you where you need to go. The NPCs on the game will send you on missions that will get you to the next NPC areas as well.And here is the cool thing about missions. There isn't so many boring fetch quests that plague most MMOs. You know like, &#34;Go kill 10 bears and 15 hides.&#34; There are some missions like that, but they are not common place in this game. These are the green colored quests and the completionist in me tried to do them all while playing through, but I found myself just doing the main story missions with the cut scenes because they are so much more fun to play!There are instances in this game and different difficulties. Normal, Elite, and Nightmare. You will notice that the instances do not have very many mobs in between bosses. Some of them have 0 trash mobs. I was a little bit dissapointed with that, until I got to fight the bosses on Elite and Nightmare difficulties as they become challenging with boss mechanics that you have to be mindful of, attacks that need to be impaired. Needless to say tanking in this game is by far the most challenging. The instances do follow the trilogy of a dps, tank and healer roles but you dont have to stick with that role completely. I have builds where I am a leech healer, so I dps and am the main healer. I have a tank/dps build where I am super squishy, but deal pretty respectful dps compared to the actual dps. As a dps you can do raw damage, sometimes you need to help the tank impair boss attacks that will wipe the whole party.", "This is an MMORPG, that reminds me a little of White Wolfs, &#34;World of Darkness&#34; storytelling series, in that it takes place in a world, much like ours, accept the monster stories you heard about as a child, are real. Things do go bump in the night, and that monster you thought was living under your bed as a child, is probably still there, watching you as you sleep.You choose one of three different factions, that really doesn't have much impact on your game, aside from preference. You still can interact with other factions, and even group up with them. You still hunt in the same zone as the other factions, and you even do the same tutorial level.The game it's self has a deep and involved storyline that, depending on the area you are in, is inspired from varios authors ranging from King to Lovecraft. Fans of horror games will find so much to love about this title.The controls are different from other MMORPGs, and it makes no attempt to be an Everquest clone like every other MMORPG out there. This is a double edged sword, in that it might make people who are afraid of new things hesitant to try this unique and remarkable title, but it also forges it's own identity, which is important for not just any game, but any product.The controls and combat isn't the only thing different in this game, as I said it's a unique experience, and has an identity all on it's own. Yes, you do engage in combat, though more often than not, you will find yourself solving puzzles, using google as a research tool, and trying to solve mysteries that surround you, because like in the real world, not everything can be solved with violence.The game is technically free to play, though you do have to buy the game(Sort of like Guildwars and guildwars2), so you don't HAVE to worry about monthly costs, which is a bonus if you are a gamer like me, that doesn't have a whole lot of free extra time on his hands. When you get some spare time, just hop in and play. Easy as that.Bottom line, this is a game you should have in your collection. No matter what type of gamer you are, I am willing to bet you will find something in this title to keep you entertained.", "\"UPDATE, 12/14/12:  Once purchased, The Secret World is now FREE TO PLAY:  No Subscription Required.Players of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games are used to a certain amount of consistency.  There are core components to MMOs that span most titles, and The Secret World tries to retain the most important of those things.  In every other area however, the makers of The Secret World aren't afraid to try to innovate and bring something new.The WorldThe idea behind The Secret World is simple:  our modern-day world has a shadow world behind it where the paranormal and the supernatural exist.  Three organizations vie for dominance in this behind-the-scenes reality:  The Dragon, the Illuminati, and the Templar.  Players can choose which faction to support, but it does not substantially change the gameplay overall so much as it changes the flow of individual missions and storylines.As you create your character, you are introduced to the world through a series of cutscenes, each of which features your character in them.  Your character never speaks, others simply talk to you as if you are there to listen.  The game is cutscene-heavy in the beginning to try to get you into the story clearly.  A few core events have to take place for you before you're let loose in the world and once you clear these hurdles, you're free to wander.  Because there are a lot of places to travel to (more open up as you grow your skills, and as Funcom adds new content), you are introduced to a supernatural travel hub that will allow you to hop from one part of the world to another.  This seemingly simple feature is actually the jumping-off point that gives the creators of The Secret World the freedom to create any possible kind of place they can imagine.Character CreationThe Secret World is a place where anything is possible, so character creation is also fairly open to your imagination too.  You can be a master of martial arts, good with guns, or supernaturally adept at spells.  Each category breaks down a bit more:  for example, \"\"Guns\"\" can mean \"\"Assault Rifles\"\", \"\"Pistols\"\", \"\"Sniping\"\", etc.  From there you can tweak it a bit further--for instance, my character uses Elemental magic and over time the skills shifted from just Fire and Electricity to more and different versions, plus an Air-based technique or two.When it comes to looks, you don't start off with a wide variety of faces, hair, or clothes.  The plus is that more clothes can be bought and you can always change your costume any time you like, but the downside is that the smaller selection of bodies and faces means you may regularly see other players who look a lot like you.  Just the same, I have seen some really creative characters wandering around, and I suspect many have an interesting story to tell.Bye Bye Levels - Hello Skills and ActionsAs your character grows, you won't see the typical system of \"\"leveling\"\".  Instead, you earn Action Points (AP) and Skill Points (SP).  Skill Points are spent to enhance particular sets of skills, such as \"\"Assault Rifles\"\", \"\"Elemental Magic\"\", etc.  You choose specific sub-sets, such as \"\"Assault Rifles-->Damage\"\" and plug points into those categories to make the skill better.  The downside is that some of your Skill Points need to be spent on equipment--being able to equip talismans that boost your skills or stats may require you to have your Talisman Skill at the  right level.  The upside is that as your skills grow, they grow in a direction that you control.Action Points are then used to buy specific things you can do within a skill set (e.g., \"\"Fireball\"\", \"\"Inferno\"\", etc.).  They climb a skill tree that branches off as it grows into separate tiers.  In other words, after you get all of the skills in the bottom tier, you can now choose one of three tiers above it and travel up that tier's skill ladder.  This allows for a lot more creativity in your skill picking, and while Action Points are represented as a wheel-like interface, the way it works reminds me more of the skill trees in The Matrix Online.Things you buy with Action Points are split into Active, such as \"\"you have to press a key to throw a fireball,\"\" and Passive, such as \"\"you take less damage from melee attacks\"\" or \"\"fire-based attacks do an additional 15 points of damage per second for 10 seconds\"\".  While this micromanagement of your skills may sound complicated it's all fairly well organized:  Action Points are laid out in a wheel and Skill Points are a left-to-right chart of your progress.If it's still too complicated, they've made things even easier for you by letting you select from 'decks' of skills:  pre-arranged basic sets of skills common to a particular character type that will pre-load your character's configuration for you.GameplayAs you move through the world, you will find that actions run on the same kinds of turn-based and timer-led operations that any other MMO does:  one action might take you 4 seconds to do, another takes only 2, and your opponent is doing their thing at the same time.  Where it gets different is a more action-oriented approach to the world:  if you stand still, a monster can run right up to you and hit you.  If you keep dodging out of their way, they won't be able to hit you without a ranged attack of some sort.  Special attacks the enemies aim at you might take a few seconds to achieve.  Their target path (or radius) will light up the area around you highlighting where the incoming attack is going to land.  An inner circle starts to grow to the outer edge of the radius--it represents the time it's taking for the bad guy to wind up the attack.  If you can get outside of the area of effect before the inner circle fills, you've just dodged the attack.  All your actions are in a hotbar at the bottom of the screen and can be launched at the tap of a key.  When you defeat an enemy, they may drop loot that you can collect.Probably the biggest way The Secret World departs from the norm is that it really does try to be story-driven.  A lot of MMOs offer quests that are so generic that most people don't even read the dialogue:  they click through the instructions, sprint off to do the job, then run back to the contact to collect their reward--rinse & repeat.  The Secret World makes its quests more unique:  each really does benefit from you reading the instructions or watching the cutscenes.  If you have to pick up a map and give it to somebody, you'll see the map pop up on your screen, a piece of artwork rendered as if you were holding the real thing in your hands.  Your missions have icons on the right side of the screen that not only let you quickly flip from one mission to another (some can be 'paused', others will be discarded and replaced with the mission you chose), each icon lets you go back to the steps of the mission and look them over again, even popping that map back up on the screen for another look.The storytelling branches out a bit further:  there are 'lore items' everywhere that you can retrieve, and as you pick them up they fill in details of backstory.  Collect them all and you have a nice little bit of reading you can do to add depth to the story.  The game has an integrated browser not because it's too hard to play without looking up a cheat, but because if you get stuck, you might need a quick look at the details to see where you took a mis-step.  The browser is also there for deliberate real-world interaction.  For example, I found an ID card on a body.  A nearby laptop had their user plugged into a command-line-based OS, but in order to login I needed to figure out their password.  Their password hint told me the password was their wife's name.  Taking another look at the ID card, I noticed a company website address.  I opened the ingame browser, went to the company website, and with a bit of digging I came up with the wife's name and voila, I was in.  Some of the quests are impossible without following clues out into the real world, where The Secret World have set up websites, YouTube channels, and other artifacts to broaden the gameplay.  Don't be shy about using the in-game browser.This is where The Secret World demands a lot of the MMO player:  you have to cool down the urge to level-grind to the top.  You need to be willing to slow the pace and enjoy the story.  Reading and paying attention rewards you.  The blessing is that there is rich solid writing behind your adventures.  The curse is that at times the cutscenes are just plain bad.  The worst example: a Texas-style cowboy, camping out in a forest filled with zombies...outside of a New England town.  This fish-out-of-water feels the need to throw in a line about how he's cooked up some baked beans on the fire, just in case the corny accent wasn't enough to make you roll your eyes.  But for every baked-bean-bad cutscene, or halting-dialogue boring one, there are some interesting ones, too:  who are these two strangers you're spying on?  They appear to have a dangerously dysfunctional relationship.  What is going through this guy's mind, as he tells you what it's like to feel his body overrun by Lovecraftian deep-sea horrors, knowing that when he dies he'll be reanimated into a shuffling, gurgling monstrosity?Playing missions with friends is easy:  no matter what server your friends exist on, you can play together wherever you like with a simple \"\"/meetup\"\" command.  Some servers are pre-flagged as being Roleplaying servers so people who prefer to talk in character can be in a world that's more like what they're looking for, while non-Roleplayer folk can get together without having to interact with the RPers.  The only awkward part about missioning with groups is that some missions have instanced sections that mean each player completes that section individually, then everyone gets back together after the instanced part (many MMOs do this).Can it Survive?In a time when every MMO except World of Warcraft seems to be closing its doors or converting to a free-to-play scheme, The Secret World still insists on having a paid subscription model.  The promise is that Funcom will earn your money:  they intend to release new content every month and always keep adding to the game.  How long they can sustain that remains to be seen, because right now you are also going to have to forgive bugged missions and the occasional large patch.  However, the graphics and sound quality are excellent, and if Funcom can fix the bugs as they grow the world, there are those who will find The Secret World to be worth the price.  I've uploaded a couple of screenshots here so you can see graphics quality straight off a player's machine.If you like MMOs and are looking for something new, I highly recommend giving The Secret World a try.  You may find just the right balance of the familiar and the new.  If you're new to MMOs, this might be more accessible to you because Funcom really do try to make the environment easier to understand and to navigate.  Just be patient with your progression and enjoy the storylines underneath.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.02220473811030388, 0.0025777053087949753, 0.0024847809690982103, 0.06575130671262741, 0.15340419113636017, 0.12485446780920029, 0.15582308173179626, 0.003311185399070382, 0.16909542679786682, 0.09142301976680756, 0.12969306111335754, 0.07937705516815186]]}
