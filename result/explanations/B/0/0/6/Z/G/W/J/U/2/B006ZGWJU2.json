Called customer service and they hardly spoke English and I was disconnected 3 different times, so that is why the low rating.  I returned the unit.", "\"This is the second Dynadock I have had.  The first is the Dynadock 5 USB 2.0 device.This one installed fine, but there is a trick I will outline below for best results.Very nice unit - the pros:Gigabit ethernet delivers 250mb on my Dell XPS 13 through the USB 3.0 port on the Dell, just as fast as using a USB 3.0 gigabit ethernet adapter - I have tried 2 types of direct connected USB 3.0 ethernets, and they did not surpass the Toshiba Dynadock in performance..  The XPS 13 has no built in ethernet.  250mb is actually very good for this type of device.The video is crisp and stable using the digital port built in.  There is a little slowdown over native video, but overall excellent up to and including 1080i video full screen on a 30\"\" monitor.  That's impressive.The Usual list of suspects works just fine - hard drives, DVD burners, etc.Audio sounds excellent.The cons:It seems underpowered.  If I plug in CD/DVD, ethernet, video, and a USB hard drive to the Dynadock, it will \"\"drop\"\" one of the devices, usually (but not always!) the CD/DVD.  That's irritating and costs it 5 starsThe audio is not reliable - oddly, sometimes it works, sometimes not.  If the audio is not working, going to the system tray and re-selecting the Dynadock device seems to fix it.The Dell XPS 13 is using Windows 7 professional, factory build.Overall, I recommend this device - and to alleviate power issues I just plug in the USB hard drive, DVD/CDROM, and ethernet.  I let the video play out of the computer's built in adapter which definitely increases the reliability and performance.  I suspect that the chip set Toshiba selected did not take into account people actually wanting to USE all the ports.  That's unfortunate, as if you look at the most common complaints that people have about USB it's simply no easy way to get the power to the desired number of devices.  The Dynadock could be a 5 star if it has the juice.  Otherwise, a very good device and I do recommend it.The installation trick - the first time I tried the install I was logged in as a standard user - not administrator.  Some of the drivers installed, but not all.  To get a satisfactory install I recommend logging in as the local computer admin (the one you installed Windows under). Oddly, domain admin for this domain joined computer was not good enough.  If you don't have local admin rights, you may not get all the drivers installed - Video, ethernet, audio.  That required uninstalling, rebooting, and re-inistalling.Oh, and I did buy this through Amazon.  Great service, fast delivery.Enjoy!\"", "I still haven't gotten this thing to work correctly with an external HD TV set.  So I just unplugged it and will try again in the future.  It did recognize external hard drives and other peripherals, though.  I'm sure I have gone wrong somewhere in the set-up procedure...  the instructions were not helpful and Toshiba is less so.  I have a Toshiba I7 laptop running Win8 and I suspect the drivers have not caught up yet.  In the past, I have had Toshiba docking stations (the old kind, which locked into the back of the computer) and was always pleased with them.  But they were mechinical connections and this one uses software connections... and I don't like it.  It may grow on me when I next try to install it with updated drivers, so I'm not going to return it.", "Purchased for Toshiba Qosmio laptop. It doesn't work.

I contacted their support which were clueless about windows 8 or their product... I tested this on 4 different computers, windows xp, windows 7 and windows 8 all had the same issue, I even tested a different USB3 cable just in case but same deal nothing worked on it. I returned it and asked for a replacement, I will update the review once the replacement is received.", "The device did have some issues initially (1st purchased in September 2012) which included that I could not plug in the docking station until after my notebook booted up; small problem; but after the firmware update in December that is cured.

I reconnect the Qosmio laptop to the Dynadock when returning home using it as my home desktop computer. I would recommend the Tobship Dynadock Docking Station to a friend.", "I'm using this with a brand new Windows 8.1 computer, and it works great.I'm quite impressed by the way this thing works. I am able to plug in my USB 3.0 laptop with one cable (well, two if you count the laptop's power cord), and my desktop is instantly spread across three high-def monitors (counting the laptop itself). The picture on the monitors is great: Sharp, clear digital picture even when playing high resolution video games.There is a small amount of CPU power being used to get the images compressed and transferred down the cable to the dock, but so far it seems like the drivers for this are written well and they use very little CPU to get the job done. I notice no data compression artifacts at all in the video picture.I had an important question about how this thing works, a question that many gamers might want to know. It just so happens that I have an acquaintance who works for DisplayLink (the company that makes the dual-monitor technology that this dock uses) and he answered the question, so I'll post it here in case anyone else had the same question:When playing a 3D game full screen, does it use its own video card drivers, or does it use the 3D Nvidia or ATI drivers on the laptop? The answer, at least on Windows systems, is: your 3D video card that's built into the laptop is still responsible for doing the 3D rendering, and the drivers for the dock will essentially &#34;scrape&#34; that already-rendered video output and squirt it down the USB cable to the dock, to decode it and put up on the attached monitors. So, in other words, it does the right thing. In my initial tests in this area, it all worked as expected and I did not notice a performance or image degredation. I haven't had a chance to really stress it yet, but I think it'll work fine going forward.This dock also works as a USB hub: It has two USB 2.0 ports, and four USB 3.0 ports. Having two of its USB ports be &#34;2.0&#34; ports seems weird, but it is actually kind of nice because it helped me with ruling out some things when I was diagnosing problems that I was having with one of my USB devices.Having two of the USB ports be on the front, for temporary plug-in items, is a nice touch.My only problem: I wish it could have had more USB ports total. As it stands, I had to plug in an additional USB3 hub to get everything plugged in that I wanted to plug in. I mean, think about it: This is a docking station, so its purpose is to make your laptop into a desktop. So that means, at a minimum, most owners will be plugging in:- Keyboard- Mouse- DVD/CD drive- Backup hard disk or backup memory card- Phone/tablet sync/charge cable- USB printer... and that's it, you're maxed it out at that point. Me, I still had other things to plug in after that! So I had to get another USB3 hub and daisy chain it in. I'll bet you will too.On the good side, I did not need to add any external power to the hub that I plugged in. Everything worked when it was just the hub connected directly to this docking station. So that's one less wall wart!"], "Gamma": [0.022855088114738464, 0.022871658205986023, 0.022871658205986023, 0.08142182976007462, 0.06473462283611298, 0.007386861369013786, 0.022871658205986023,
