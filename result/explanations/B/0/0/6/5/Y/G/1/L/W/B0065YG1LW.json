No, I'm not that old, I just have access to past issues.  This beginners toy is for a beginning explorer.  The magnifying glass is the best part - big and rugged.  The lights for the shoes - cumbersome and awkward.  The compass...meh.  All great for teaching a curious 4 year to 6 year old, but not much to sustain them after the first backyard exploration is over.The good thing is is that there is more than enough room in the enclosed explorer bag to add other tools for exploring...say, bug collection boxes or newspaper for wrapping rock samples.The packaging is quaint - it is a cardboard box with a crate look. And there are helpful cards with each tool that offer creative suggestions for budding scientists' parents.Over all, not bad, but geared for 4 - 6 year olds.", "\"This item is a toy, not a science kit. If you know a child who likes to explore (which is probably nearly all children), this pack is great for pretend-play. What's odd is that the price seems a bit high, but I think that might be because of the shoe lights that are like little flashlights on the feet. Chances are, most children aren't going on night expeditions to see those lights in action, but they are fun for playing in a darkened room. Each shoe light requires 3 AAA batteries (total of 6), so be ready for that.The 3-in-1 magnifying glass is a little over 6\"\", with 3\"\" of 'glass' diameter. Btw, it's not real glass - it's plastic. The entire thing is plastic, but since it's a toy carried by little children, less weight is a good thing. The handle of the magnifying glass includes a plastic pick and a brush. Again, they're plastic, so don't expect to do serious archaeological experiments. Besides, they're only 2 3/8\"\" long. The pick is particularly useless, but the brush is fun for dusting off stones.The 4-in-1 navigation tool has a thermometer, compass, whistle and mirror. All these components work. The mirror which acts like a cover to the compass often pops off though. The tool has a carabiner-type hook and can work like it, but it doesn't have a real hinge because it's one piece of plastic - the \"\"hinge\"\" is purely decorative.The drawstring bag is about 15\"\" x 12\"\" and has plenty of room for other items.It's fun for playing around in the house or finding stuff on a walk in the neighborhood. As for using it on a hike, there aren't any useful tools. This has tools requiring more advanced concepts like direction and temperature, but the toy itself seems more appropriate for younger elementary school-aged kids. Maybe this shouldn't have tried to cover too broad of a range because it's not satisfying for either age. Well, the younger ones like it though pricey while the older ones wouldn't like it very much.\"", "This consists of a bug catcher, several booklets with information about the outdoors and challenges or ways to use the equipment, night lights to put on your shoes and a magnifying glass with some other odd tools. The magnifying glass handle unscrews so you can store your brushes for excavating. There is also a compass.The magnifying glass and the compass have a bit of a childish look to them. However, my young son, age 9, was captivated with them and promptly put them to good use outside. They are made of plastic and they have the feel of something that might break easily. However, they haven't broken yet with use so they must be sturdy.The shoe lights are the best part of the whole kit. You can hook them onto your shoe and use red lights or white lights and the little booklet that comes with the ligths have a few outdoor games you can play with them.I think overall that htis would appeal to a younger set of children than my nine year old. In general I would suggest that this would be a great set up for a 4 or 5 year old. However, my 9 year old completely enjoyed this set.I believe, based on seeing the 'stuff' and playing with it and handling it and inspecting it and seeing it put to use, that this seems overpriced. If you are familiar with Uncle Milton products, this would be a typical Uncle Milton product that does not live up to the National Geographic name brand.Enjoy.", "\"This set includes 3 products: a navigation tool, a magnifier, and shoe lights. We gave these to our kid, ages 9, 7, and 4, during a recent camping trip. The most popular item by far was the navigation tool. My kids were very interested in learning how the compass worked. There is a mirror that flips out and allows you to \"\"signal\"\" to another person to show where you are. On the opposite side of the compass is a thermometer. There is even a whistle on the top to help signal (which my 4 year old loved).The magnifier is interesting because it has tools hidden inside of the handle. One is a little tool that looks similar to a screwdriver and allows you to \"\"chip\"\" away at the dirt surrounding a fossil or some other found object. The other tool allows you to dust off the fossil or object. These are tools for a budding archeologist.The last tool, the shoe lights were not as popular. The reason for this may be because the kids didn't really run around at night. There are two settings for the lights. One has a regular white glow and the other has two small red lights. Each of the lights takes three AAA batteries (which seems like a lot of battery for such little lights).\"", "\"My 6-year-old son, at present, wants to be an archaeologist. Of course, he also wants to be a football player, a fireman, and a couple of other things. As a parent, I want to encourage him toward learning the skills for anything right now. Except I don't really need him starting fires to practice putting them out...but that's another discussion.I gave him the Uncle Milton NGO Explorer's Pack to play with. Here are the observations:1. The bag is average quality. It has help up for several weeks, which is better than I would have expected. Has it been on many a rugged hike in the wilderness? No, but it's survived several weeks of 6-year-old handling. It's about average.2. Magnifying glass: actually works and not fragile. That's good.3. \"\"Dig tools:\"\" in the handle of the magnifying glass. Useful for fulfilling the activities on the sheet, or for finding the lost evidence of the \"\"Tonka Civilization\"\" that apparently left behind both plastic and metal vehicles in the yard last summer.4. Shoe lights: right. Not impressed with these, but they're fun.5. 4-in-1 Explorer Navigation tool: the compass is almost right most of the time. This is not for turning your kid lose in a field and telling them that food is north. This is for simple usage and found (as in \"\"NOT LOST\"\") direction seeking.6. Activity Guides: provide some suggestions on what to do with the tools. Moderately educational.In all, this is fun stuff. There is a good educational value. For the kids, basic understanding of simple tools like these. For the parents, a good gauge of when your child might be ready for something more real.It is not solid. I expect to see these all worn through by the end of this summer. It will be a lot of fun until then, and already has been. Especially since he already had the hat: Kids Deluxe Indiana Jones HatI would not have a problem giving this as a gift in terms of quality for a child under 8. One going through a \"\"serious\"\" phase, as some kids do, would probably scoff at it, but those who are \"\"playing\"\" at archaeologist would like it.(Amazon prices fluctuate a good deal, so see what you think it's worth to you. Right now, I'd say it's pricey at around forty, but at half that it would be a good bargain. I have bought cheaper incarnations of these types of toys, but they have not lasted near at all.)\"", "\"My kids are 5 and almost 3, and this set of explorer tools is perfect for my 3 year old, and ok for the 5 yr old. The biggest surprise to me is the little instruction and activity pamphlets that come with each item. They are printed on brown paper to look like hand written notes from another explorer, and the suggestions of activities in them are actually things my kids and I enjoy doing. These little pamphlets make the difference between a box of plastic junk your kids will probably ignore, and a box of tools you can use to have fun with your kids. If you expect this to be a toy your kids can enjoy alone or around the house you might be disappointed, but for a family activity I love this.I like the box this comes in, cardboard printed to look like a wooden crate. Usually I put toys in plastic toys for storage but this box is cute enough and the right size that I can just keep it. The backpack is useful, when you follow the suggestions in the instruction booklets you will need it to carry home all the interesting leaves and rocks your kid collects. The magnifier handle comes with two \"\"excavation tools\"\" in the handle, actually a pointed stick and a little brush, but if your child loves those plaster fossil and gem digging kits the way mine does he will be thrilled. We buy one of those kits every month almost and the magnifier will get a lot of use for those as well. The 4 in 1 compass has a compass, thermometer, mirror and whistle. Unfortunately the pamphlet with the compass includes a map making activity which doesn't make any sense, and I had to ding the set another star for that. The shoe lights are cute and offer red light, which is easier on the eyes in the dark and doesn't scare away wildlife the way white lights do, but do not come with batteries. The instructions say they take a button battery but as I learned in another review they actually take 3 AAA's each. It's kind of a big battery investment in my opinion, it would have been nice if they were included, especially for the price of the kit.For preschoolers and kindergarteners this kit is a 3 star item. It's cute and well made. If you've got a Go Diego Go or Magic Tree House fan at home this will probably thrill them. For 6 to 8 this is probably a 1 star toy, kids that age will (rightly) feel like these are toys and not tools.\"", "\"I thought this kit was perfect!,if priced a bit on the high side, but many of the possibilities it opens for the hours of play and imagination made it \"\"priceless!\"\".  Here's a evaluation of the contents of the Box:1. The Explorer Academy Bag..... It works as a child size drawstring duffle bag or backpack. It is roomy, another reviewer felt it too large.  On the contrary! this makes it perfect to slip in the \"\"tools and a lunch/snacks and drink and a jar and ziplock bags to \"\"collect\"\" treasures or artifacts!2. (2)Shoe Lights.....These are awesome! adjustable flashlights for your shoes! I would have loved these as a child at night when we used to go hunting in our yard and the neighbors for worms (to go fishing) and bugs (for our bug collections). They have some adjustability and are well constructed, your child will need help putting the batteries in and possibly getting them firmly attached to shoe laces/velcro straps.  They remind me of one of the Gadgets that the boy \"\"Data\"\" Wang popped up with in the movie \"\"The Goonies\"\"!!!! These come with a small activity guide of ideas's of what to explore with them and how to attach to shoes.3. Large Magnifying Glass..... Perfect item to have in the kit, has two levels of magnification. It also has a base clip so they can attach it to their belt/belt loop, or on the strap/cord of the backpack. You can unscrew that base clip and inside there (2)tools, a small brush to brush off artifacts and a little poking tool. (If I had some input, I would have changed the poking tool into a tweezer's so that you could also pickup bugs/leaves with as well as poke into dirt).  It also comes with an activity guide with ideas for use in exploring their environment.4. 4-in-One Navigation tool.....This is pretty awesome, I it has a Temperature Gauge and Whistle, flip open the backside to revel a compass and mirror (to signal friends...another \"\"Data\"\" gadget!) It has a attachment clip and activity guide also.  I think the Manufactures Age recomendations is off.......I feel it is more for the 5 to 10 years of age.  Anyone much over ten would not appreciate the imagination time this kit provides.\"", "\"To be honest, I agreed with the top reviewer here when I opened the box.  My initial reaction was \"\"junk!\"\".  It seems like a lot of plastic.  But my kids grabbed ahold of the parts and had a blast with them, so I need to be objective in this review and let you know what you're getting here so you can make up your own mind.The whole thing comes in a cardboard box that looks like a wooden crate - so it piqued my kids' attention immediately.  You get a drawstring pouch with rope straps to carry it on your back which my kids emptied and ignored.  There are 3 \"\"field guides\"\" included in the bag.  The photo on Amazon makes these look like fun little books, but in reality they are small tri-folded pieces of paper with about 1 paragraph of useless text on them.  There is really nothing to read, so calling them \"\"activity field guides\"\" in a bit of a stretch.My kids instantly took to the magnifying glass.  It is a normal plastic magnifying glass with a smaller area for higher-zoom on it, but it is a kind of cool looking tool with a plastic handle made to look like wood.  The base unscrews and there is a small plastic chisel and brush.  They are basically useless for excavating anything, but my kids thought they were cool because they were hidden in the handle.  There is a fake carabiner on the handle as well (a plastic loop with a cut in it that looks like a carabiner).You also get a multi-function compass.  The compass has a flip-up signal mirror over the compass surface.  The compass itself has no liquid inside - it is dry, but seems to work fine for finding north.  The compass also has a loud whistle on the side which was a hit.  The back of the compass has a hard to use thermometer, which is marked in Fahrenheit and Celsius.  For some reason, the markings in Fahrenheit are 41, 59, 77, 95.  So when the needle was halfway between 77 and 95, my kids didn't instantly figure out it was 86.  Why they designed it like this, I have no idea.  The compass also has a fake carabiner on it.Finally, you get two lights that clip on your shoes.  They don't come with batteries, and the instructions say to get coin cell batteries.  Good thing I didn't listen to the instructions, because they actually take AAA batteries.  You'll need 3 each or 6 total, so don't give this as a gift without buying batteries because none come with the set.  Also, you will need a screwdriver (not included) to install the batteries, so bring one of those as well if you are gifting it.  The lights are reasonably bright and feature a white light or red LED.  Outdoor survival lights have red LED's so you don't ruin your night vision.  I expected the field guide to explain this, but instead it just had a game where you run around the yard with different color lights turned on.  Once again, the field guides were useless.  The lights themselves have clips on them to clip on the tongue of the shoes, or the shoe laces can be looped through.So is it junk?  I certainly thought so.  But my boys were having a blast with it, enough so that I bumped it up to 4 stars, but decided to write this overly descriptive review so you know precisely what you are getting here.  Personally, I recommend you buy a real magnifying glass, compass, and flashlight for the adventurer in your life.  But for a gift, this might just light up someone's day.\"", "For exploring the great outdoors kid-style, this pack present some fun projects.Our early elementary aged children love the outdoors, and we encourage it.  There's absolutely too much time that children are staring at some form of an electronic screen.  We need a revolution!  More time in the natural enviroment, even if it's just the backyard, a patio or a park.Contents: a light pack to hold stuff or snacks; a pretty good magnifying lens with some simple tools inside, a working compass with a reflecting lid to send signals, a whistle, adjustable lights for the feet for seeing where one's headed in dark places, a thermometer, and a few projects to do, e.g., map out your backyard, do some digging/foraging to see what's in the grass or dirt, record temperature changes different times of the day, etc.The lights attached to the kids' shoestrings or velcro straps and require 2 button batteries, not included.  They move up or down to direct the light, and the kiddoes think they're pretty cool.  The items are made out of hard plastic and have held up.  The bag is more vulnerable and is likely to tear someday.The educational value is what you put into it.  We read over the projects and helped them with the instructions, and then just let them go to play and discover as they see fit.I have no problem with this Explorer's pack except the price.  Great idea, need to drop the price $20.", "Because of the name 'National Geographic' used on this toy, that doesn't necessarily mean this is some kind of great quality product; I realized this after purchasing many toys based on their brand name. This is basically cheap toy for 5 or 6 year olds they can bring when hiking or camping. Due to the weather conditions these days, we haven't tried this pack outdoor yet, my son (6 now) is anticipating bringing this to hiking/camping this summer. The items, including magnifying glass, whistle, two shoe led lights (that don't come with six aaa batteries,) compass/thermometer, bag, brush, and a small plastic screw driver are all functional (maybe except the screw driver), and my son actually really liked them and enjoyed playing even indoors. He got to learn about compass and played shoe lights. The quality is, I would say, typical plastic toy quality. It might feel cheap, but these are toys. It might not last a lifetime, but I'm sure it can last a couple of years.If you're thinking a high quality outdoor stuff from this pack, don't bother. This is just a  plastic toy set. Nothing more. And if you take this as a toy set, you will be satisfied. This is nice toy set, but it's just the name that implies and give potential buyers false expectation.", "It comes in a bag with draw strings. It includes a compass, mirror, and thermometer; a magnifier with little tools in the handle, and lights that can be put on to your shoes. The bag is fairly big for what comes with it, but I think that is so you can add to it. It is not very good for a backpack, but it does close tightly and it might be easier to have it over one shoulder. My daughter finds it lots of fun and wants to bring it with her where ever she goes. It is definitely worth it.", "\"My daughter loves this explorer's pack and rates it as \"\"awesome\"\" and \"\"definitely 5 stars.\"\" She's had a lot of fun using them outside in our large backyard (several acres) and really feels like an explorer. As a mom, I'm not certain it's worth the price, and the quality makes it most useful around the house instead of \"\"in the wild.\"\" However, I do have to say that my daughter has gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this, so I'm rating it as she wishes. :)\"", "I have to say I was disapointed in this product. When I read other reviews of it I thought that other people where being overly critical and picked it up anyway. I mean for the price, I thought my expectations would be in line. But it's just cheap."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.07704497873783112, 0.08468896150588989, 0.08089278638362885, 0.07743760198354721, 0.07045097649097443, 0.0801713839173317, 0.05217726156115532, 0.08269234746694565, 0.08316109329462051, 0.0718015804886818, 0.0823146253824234, 0.07376710325479507, 0.08339931070804596]]}
