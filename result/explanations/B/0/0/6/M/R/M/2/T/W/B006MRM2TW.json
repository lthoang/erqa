"], "reviews": ["I'm going to start off by saying that I think this would be a great curling iron for hair that is mid-back length. I, on the other hand, have hair the goes a little past my shoulders. The curls were tighter than I prefer them to be and I was hoping for more of a looser, beachy style of wave. Although, I didn't care for the hairstyle this created on me, someone else with longer hair might really like it.", "The design  of the new Goody Heat Wave Creator is not only beautiful but it allows you to make perfect loose and free flowing curls. This curling iron heats up really fast and allows you to style your hair in a hurry without any frizzing of your hair. The rod doesn't stick to your hair even with styling products on it and this is so important because it won't damage your hair.The only issue that I had with the Heat Wave was the clip was too short and you had to hold the hair to curl and it was somewhat difficult because you had to use both of your hands.I really like the Goody Heat Wave and love the way it makes my hair look.", "I was a little skeptical of this iron, because I've tried alllllll kinds, and not many do much for my hair, but this was a delightful exception. I was amazed at how well it worked, and how natural (and gorgeous!) my hair looked afterward. One caveat: The heat goes up pretty high, so my hair smelled slightly fried afterward! Try it on a lower temp before you crank it all the way up. I used this for waves, but it also makes really cute sausage curls (if you're in the demographic that that looks good on -- I'm not!).", "My teenage daughter has been using this.  It heats up quickly and is easy to use.  She has medium-long hair.  The waves are beautiful and last well.  She really likes the Goody Heat Natural Waves Curling Iron.", "I have freakishly long, straight, fine, color-treated hair.  If this gadget works for me, it'll work for just about anybody.It works really well.  I followed the suggestions provided--beginning the wave halfway down the strand of hair and then working back up.  The waves look natural and summery.  It doesn't take all that long to use on your whole head, and is lots faster than blow drying with a round brush.  I always air-dry my hair and sometimes it gets kind of bent at weird angles.  The Goody is great for evening things out.Count me very pleased!", "The first time I used this curling iron, I burned myself.  Not badly, but I haven't burned myself in a ages, so it was quite a shock!  However, it's mainly because I was used to using my old standby curling iron - the kind that clips down the ends of your hair, and that you roll up the hairs with.  With the Goody Heat Wave, there's an inch clip at the very bottom, then you twirl the hair around the iron - it's much easier said than done!  I have a little over shoulder length hair, and it was a challenge for me!  I ended up holding the tip of my hairs, and held the curling iron with the end pointed down towards the ground to effectively twirl it around the barrel.  My sister, who has mid back hair, could clip the end of her hair to the clip at the base of the iron, and literally just twirl her hair around the barrel.Either way you hold it, the curling effect was awesome - practically perfect spiral curls.  I loved the look much more than my conventional iron, but there was that period where I had to play with the iron to get it right!  This is definitely an iron you'll have to play around with to figure out how to hold it and use it, but the results are worth it!  The Heat Wave does heat up quickly - quite the added bonus.  All in all, I loved the look, but didn't love the learning curve.  Recommended, once you figure it out!", "This has the potential to be a great product for medium to long hair, but its extremely hard to use.If the manufacturer would have made the clip the size of the iron (like a regular curling iron) it would have been fantastic.In order to use the product you literally have to wrap your hair around the wand which is very hard and extremely awkward.  The clip is so small it doesn't hold hair very well and the hair constantly slips out.  I have long hair so this should have been easy for me to use, but it wasn't.  The only way I could get it to work was to wind my own hair on the wand, which is very time consuming with long and thick hair.  I have had just as good results just twisting my hair damp and then clipping the twists until they dry.  This takes a lot less time and the results are basically the same.If you have the patience for this, you will get a nice soft curl that really stays.  The other thing I did like about it is that it takes the frizz out of your hair while curling it.I am hoping this product has not hit the shelves as the manufacturer realized they made a huge mistake in not making the clip bigger.  If this is the case this is a product that I would buy and recommend.", "I normally either use a large curling iron (without a spring )to straighten my hair (in place of flat iron), or I curl my hair with the last couple inches left out of it so that it gets that beacy windswept look.  I thought the Goody Heat Wave Creator Styling Iron would be perfect for me to use on the days I wanted my hair curled like that.  Therefore, I tried using it without the clip and just wrapping my hair around the iron.My hair is probably about 8 inches or so below my shoulders.  I found that this iron definitely isn't good for hair as long as mine, at least not how I tried using it.  I would have to either double back (left a weird kink), or actually wrap a couple times in the same locations.  The shape of the barrel made this difficult, and I just couldn't get the style I was trying for.  Maybe it would be good for somebody with medium length hair, but I think I'll stick with my regular non-spring curling iron for now.", "My wife and daughter have been using this. Here are their notes and observations on this product:>It took them a while to get familiar enough with the device to make consistent curls.>Heats up quickly>Dont expect curls like in the product description images, but overall it gives a decent curl that lasts", "I really like this curling iron. It heats up quickly and so far after over a week of of use - no damage at all to my hair.There are really two ways to curl your hair. You can simply wrap the hair around the iron and hold it with your fingers, or you can secure the hair with the clip and then wind it around your hair.The iron makes beautiful tight  curls, and at first I thought it was limited to that. But if you spread the hair more loosely (pulling the hair further so it doesn't cover all of the iron but leaves gaps) then it's a looser wave.Highly recommended. I am usually terrible getting the right curl with these type irons but this one was easy.", "Creates great waves more so than actual curls. Works better on longer hair -I have medium length and I can't picture anyone with shorter hair having an easy time with this iron. Does heat up quickly and takes a few minutes to get the hang of it but so far so good. Not the best or convenient iron around, but for quick, every day styling it works!", "POSITIVES: It heats up very quickly. It does a good job of creating loose, natural curls and I received many compliments on my hair.NEGATIVES:This curling iron works best with very long hair. I say this because I had trouble keeping my shorter locks of hair from falling off the iron. As you can see from the picture, the clip is very short. Compared to my older curling iron, which sandwiched my hair between two identically long clips, you must twirl long tresses of hair (like spaghetti round a fork) fully around the appliance to keep the hair from falling off. Otherwise you have to be careful not to accidentally touch a hot area when you're holding the hair in place (ouch!)When using the clip, it is so short that it forces you to put your head very close to the heat of the iron, which I didn't find comfortable.I'm guessing it was designed this way because a clip tends to flatten the volume a little.OVERALL SCORE: Good but let your hair grow out for best results!", "\"The point of this device is to quickly render soft, flowing supermodel curls and waves. Think Heidi Klum rather than Heidi the Swiss orphan. Honestly, the last thing one wants is to look like an extra in Gone With The Wind and with this type of curling iron, things can go very, very wrong very, very quickly. It is for this reason, I have to admit, that prior to trying this styling iron, I was more than a little skeptical.As other reviewers have mentioned, there is a bit of a learning curve here. The instructions are basic and leave many questions unanswered. Unless you live with a professional hair stylist, trial and error is the only way. I recommend you practice winding your hair (front, sides, top, and back) around the barrel of this curler before you plug it in. Get comfortable with it while it is still easy to handle, because once it gets hot, you want to work fairly quickly and with little hesitation.Since I have just revitalized my hair with Nature's Way Organic Coconut Oil, 16 Ounce, I wanted to make sure that the heat of this curler would not burn or do any damage. I set the curler on to a heat setting of 5 out of a maximum 10. I found that was plenty hot for my hair.The instructions indicate that for loose, flowing curls, one's hair should be wrapped around the larger parts of the barrel. The wand should be held vertically with the end facing down. This is only possible with very long hair, 7\"\" - 8\"\" or longer. Shorter hair can only wrap around both the wide and narrow parts. This turns out not to be a problem but one goes through several aborted winding attempts trying to accomplish the impossible.I highly recommend a back mirror to get the back of the head done. It's very important to see what you are doing.I sectioned my hair in 2\"\" sections. Starting at ear level, while holding the ends of the hair, I wound each section around the larger parts of the barrel and held it for no more than a second or two. I did the sides and as much of the back as I could comfortably reach while holding the wand vertically. I then very carefully did the hair around my face.The biggest problem is that you need to be very careful not to burn yourself while you are wrapping your hair around a very hot metal wand that you are trying to hold vertically. You can easily burn your fingers, your nose, your ears, or the back of your neck. Luckily, I only burned myself once. It was left wrist. It hurt but did not blister. Beauty is savage.The end result was fairly decent beachy, bed head waves that have lasted all day. My wrist is healing nicely.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.07839446514844894, 0.07963761687278748, 0.0796806812286377, 0.08612777292728424, 0.05815204232931137, 0.08136652410030365, 0.0884544774889946, 0.07333900034427643, 0.08113420009613037, 0.06460072845220566, 0.08191318064928055, 0.07808361202478409, 0.06911575049161911]]}
