Overall these were just what I wanted, fairly light weight, easy to adjust and small enough to throw in a suitcase.  I've had other small binoculars before and let me say that these are much better!  I'm pleased with these and very glad I purchased them.", "I am very pleased with my new binoculars. I had done a lot of research on lower priced glasses and these binoculars came up to my specifications. They are clear and although they may weigh a little more than the more expensive ones I expected this. I wear glasses and I have had problems in the past viewing from binoculars without taking my glasses off. With the H20's I do not have to.  I bought them also because they are advertised to be waterproof/fogproof. I guess I will need to wait to see about that.", "Very nice, solid feel, small enough to be easily carried. Less than 2 pounds, comes with a case, strap and generic lens cleaning cloth. Front lens protectors are kept on by separate rubber rings, rear ones attach to the strap.Has an excellent image, very bright, even in low light (which was something criticized on some bird watchers' forums). Easily focused. I was considering the 8x42 instead, but the 10x is easily held, and very stable. Can focus as close at (at least) 12 feet.", "These compare very favorably with the binoculars of my youth. They have a nice heft and feel to them. I'm not someone who uses these often and I don't have anything recent to compare them to, but I was very impressed with the optics and clarity. I haven't used them in inclement weather, nor am i likely to, but it's nice to know they are built to handle the elements. This fits about midrange amplification-wise compared to the two sets we used to have, but for general use I would think these are a good choice. Somewhat compact but with enough power to make a real difference in what you are looking at.", "I give the binoculars 5 stars for the price and the accessories 4 starsI bought the glasses for a trip I will be taking to Alaska and am very pleased with them.  I am sure there are better lenses, but I don't need to see the gnat on a bear's tail, I just want a good look at the bear.  With these glasses, I am confident that is what I will get.Instructions come with the glasses for adjusting them for your eyes.  It is worth spending a little time making them.  Out of the box they weren't bad, but I was able to make some very helpful adjustments.The glasses feel light in your hands and they are comfortable to hold.  The rubberized armor covering gives you a good grip even, I'm sure, when the glasses are wet.  They are waterproof, so no need to keep them in the case on drizzly days.The strap is adequate, but not what I want around my neck for an extended period.  I replaced it with a strap off a camera bag I am not using that is wider, softer, and has a little spring to it.  Much more comfortable.  In the future, I may try a harness if I find I don't like to have my neck taking the weight during extended use.The case that comes with glasses is well made, but it needs to be larger in order to hold the glasses as well as a decent strap or harness.  It barely holds the glasses with the supplied strap attached.I have not marked the glasses down for the case or the strap because it was the glasses that I wanted.  And for the price, I figure I got a good buy  even without the case and strap.", "Read all the good reviews here and decided to make the purchase. Needed them for my trip to Maui and Oahu so I could view the distant sites.  They worked great. Were small so easy to fit in my luggage. Focus was easy and magnification was all I needed. Just a great pair of smaller binocularsIt does come with a case and neck strap which was nice.", "We bought two pair of these binoculars for bird watching and we're very pleased with them.  They're relatively light and well constructed.  We find they're easy to line up with the object you wish to see.", "These are not toys nor are they cheap binoculars. They are the real deal. If your into watching sports up close or bird watching these are for you. Their 8X42 focal length brings images up close and personal. They are worth the ticket. Recommended. 9/24/12 Update. Two weeks ago my girlfriend and I were on vacation on Chincoteague Island, Virginia and these Binoculars were the hit. My girlfriend has another model of Bushnell Binoculars and she was using mine the whole time. We got them wet, dropped it in puddles(not recommended) but they took a licking and were still extreme. Bald Eagles look terrific in the eyes of these binoculars.", "Top notch quality, a great price, crystal clear optics, fast focus, great weight and feel, attached lens covers that can't get lost, what more can you ask for?", "These were fantastic on an Alaskan cruise I was just on. Perfect strength and range. Being water and fogproof helped as it was foggy some days, and the camera lenses were fogging up but these weren't. Nice portable size made it easy to travel with.On some of the excursions I took, the tour operators had binoculars for the guests to use. The size they used was 7x35. I tried them out and they were not as nice as the H2O's. These are stronger and have a winder field of view. I was definitely glad I brought these along.", "I have a few in the past but none of them is as good as this one. This binocular is crystal clear and brings the image so close from a far distant. The size is perfect, not too big and the weight is right. It is well built and should last for many years.", "I have never bought an expensive pair of binoculars in my life, and I never will. I have always been pleased with Tasco, Bushell, and Celestron. Based on the price and the reviews, these Bushnells seemed like the top-choice shelf for my needs.I bought these binoculars because I needed an extra set for travel. While reasonably compact, they are sort of an odd design. They are rubberized with a black and blue-grey rubber. The cap covers on the front lenses are great because they remain attached and hang down (once you adjust the rings that hold them). The cap covers on the back are not attached and so you have to hold them or put them in your pocket (a minor issue, I know, but a classic annoyance with most field binoculars).Using the binoculars, the picture appears sharp and there's plenty of light, but I honestly feel a bit like a cyclops when using them. The eye pieces are so very narrow, it makes my eyes feel strange while using them. I feel like I'm being forced cross-eyed. You can adjust them outward a bit, but not nearly as much as on a standard full-size pair of binoculars. Whenever I pick them up, I immediately go to widen them and realize that they are already as wide as they'll go.I'm hoping this pair of compact binoculars will grow on me, but I can see that I'll be using my other Bushnells or Celestrons for most occasions, and will only take these when space is a real premium. I would say that these binoculars are about the size of two 8oz cans of Red Bull side-by-side. I've compared this with my other Bushnells and Celestrons and the field-of-view at distances is considerably less. To put it another way, these would be poor binoculars for star gazing a wide area or terrestrial landscape viewing of a large group of birds or vegetation, but they would be good for an outdoor concert or sporting event where you're looking at one person or one fixed point.", "I've had a few pairs of binoculars - cheap, lightweight ones that didn't really give that great of a view and heavy, more expensive ones that worked well but were a pain to lug around. These manage to capture the best of both worlds - they're light and easy to carry around (especially once you attach the included strap) and they offer a pretty incredible distance view (up to 8X magnification, according to the box - and I believe it). The rubbery material is easy to grip without slipping and the distance between eyes is easy to adjust, as is the focus. My wife and I can pass these back and forth and adjust the focus to our differing eyesight and eye placement in seconds. The fact that they're waterproof is an added bonus. I really can't recommend these things highly enough."], "Gamma": [0.032556500285863876, 0.0325540192425251, 0.03251132741570473, 0.032557740807533264, 0.032557740807533264, 0.032557740807533264,
