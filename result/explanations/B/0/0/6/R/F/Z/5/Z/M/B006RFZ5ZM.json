"], "reviews": ["I have been looking for a face scrub that is not too harsh on my skin, but one that also does not leave my skin feeling greasy like the Neutrogena one I have been using. This scrub really seems to deep clean my skin and unclog my pores, all while leaving my face feeling clean. It arrived on time without any issues!", "I used the Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub a couple of times, and it gave my skin a scratchy, irritating feeling. My face did feel clean after each use, but my face was very red and irritated. I would not purchase this product because of my sensitive skin.", "Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub feels nice on the skin. It's not too harsh like a lot of these scrubs where the granules have a sandy texture. This is smooth, but just rough enough that you can feel it digging more deeply into the pores than other facial products.It has a slight scent that I can only compare to milk. It's not unpleasant, but I could do without it.", "At first I was pretty skeptical of a product that has magical blue beads in it to help scrub your face clean.  But after using it and having my son use, it has indeed made a difference for both of us.  His face has cleared up and mine just feels clean.My face also felt a little dry/tight after using this so if your skin is sensitive you might want to try a little less to start.", "Since my skin is both ageing and oily, I am always delighted to find a scrub that does not irritate or excessively dry the surface. This scrub has excellent exfoliant properties, with no irritation, redness, or scaling. Highly recommended.", "the wife and daughter loves this stuff.  it cleans their skin squeeky clean.  they say it gets the dirt and makeup out of the pores and your skin just feels cleaner.  so girls if you trile on the makeup this product is for you.  it cleans all that makeup off so you can reapply it the next day with a new layer.", "This product is used by me (70 years old), my daughter (50) and her two daughters (13.)  It works well on all our various skin types which range from my dry-and-fragile to a granddaughter's young-and-oily.  It has a nice, fresh, light menthol scent.  We all like the texture -- not gritty and coarse, because the tiny, round beads make it surprisingly smoother and creamier than most exfolients.  Sometimes this type of cleanser can feel like clay, but not this one.  It rinses easily and leaves skin fresh and clean without feeling sanded or dried out.", "\"I routinely use products with salicylic acid and they keep my skin clear.  I did not have any breakouts while using this, so in that respect it was a success.  However, calling this a \"\"scrub\"\" is misleading.  The scrub particles are few and far between.  Further, they are suspended in a lotion that has a very unpleasant feel to it.  I can't decide if it's muddy, slimy, waxy, or what, but I don't like it.  The fragrance, while not especially strong, is also unpleasant.  Another thing I noticed is a burning or stinging sensation around my lips and nose after I rinse it off. The Biore isn't so bad I'll throw it away, but I won't buy it again.  I will go back to the Neutrogena pink scrub I was using before, which is a bit more expensive, but much more pleasant all around.\"", "Cursed with problem skin since pre-adolescence, I've definitely tried my share of products. I was pleased to try this scrub. It's fresh-smelling and leaves your skin feeling tingly clean. Also, you only need the smallest dab - put it in the palm of your hand and add a little warm water! I'll definitely be buying this again.", "I wasn't blown away with this face wash.  I've used Biore in the past with decent results, but the reason I gave it only 3 stars is because of the long term experience.The face wash certainly delivers on its promise to be pore unclogging.  The little gel balls inside the face wash are invigorating, cleansing the skin, and effectively washing away dead skin cells with its scrubbing power.  The good thing about the face wash is that the scrubbing power is not too intense (some face washes feel like you are scrubbing your face away).  This product doesn't do that, instead it leaves you feeling fresh and revived.  It has just about the right amount of scrub power.The reason I gave this only a 3 was because of the long term effects.  I used the product for several weeks and at the beginning of my experience my skin was primarily clear, but after a few weeks my skin seemed to revert and the product was less effective.  I'm not sure if that is because of outside influences or the face wash.  But in hindsight I would use this product a couple times a week in order to exfoliate your skin and follow up with a gentle cleanser in the interim.", "I can always count on Biore for a great face wash. This scrub is no exception. It really does work and I feel as if the dirt in my pores have been lessened from using this. I like the way it tingles as I use it, which makes me believe it's working fast.I would recommend any Biore product, including this one, for those who want a successful face wash/scrub.Katiebabs", "This is a good scrub for a slightly oily complexion, helps to keep pimples down, and moisturizes just the right amount. Biore always makes quality products, and this one is no exception.", "I received this product through the Vine Program as I wanted to try a deep cleansing scrub.  I don't wear heavy mnakeup and am out doors a lot with golf and other activities.  My face seemed to need a face scrub and wanted to give this a try.  After I remove my makeup in the evenings I use just a small dab of this scrub on each side of my face.  I work the scrub in and around my nove and mouth keeping it away from my eyes.  It has a small blue bead and I can feel the scrub working as I move slowly around my face.  You get a very clean feel and a simple wash off your face with water and you feel refreshed.  My skin has aged with wrinkles and grooves from my 87 years of sometimes neglect.  This scrub leaves it soft and refreshed.  With just a small dab of face lotion it keeps my face feeling clean and soft.Letta Meinen", "Putting a few blue beads in a heavy, waxy cream is not a &#34;scrub.&#34; A true scrub should have a very dense quantity of grit in an emulsion of cleanser. I also think this does the opposite of clearing your pores. It's full of wax and though your skin feels soft after you use it, what you're feeling is that wax coating your skin. You'll definitely need Biore Pore Strips if you use this regularly.", "I have a blackhead issue. I am working hard to combat it and I feel that this works, but not quite as well as I like.  It is a mild exfoliator (sparse scrubbing blue balls. Gentle isn't always bad, but it is too weak for me so if you also have a real issue with your pores this may not be best for you. Additionally, it just feels kind of greasy going on and feels a bit filmy when i wash it off. Usually I love Biore products but this one was just not right for my skin. I would recommend for sensitive skin with mild pore issues and no aversion to cream cleansers. It should be noted that while I don't think it worked well for me it did not cause irritation or break outs which was great.", "This is the first time I've ever used a scrub with salicylic acid and I think it's a great innovation. I was worried that -- while it would exfoliate well and help reduce breakouts -- it might be too strong for my no-longer-teenage-skin. So far, that has not been a problem and there's no incremental redness. Also, a little scrub goes a long way. I just wish there was a little less fragrance.", "I have fairly typical combination skin -- some areas are oily, some are normal, a couple have a tendency to dryness. My usual facial cleansing routine is a foaming cleanser likeAveeno Clear Complexion Foaming Cleanser, 6 Ouncein the winter and a scrubbing cleanser likeSt. Ives Blemish & Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 ozin the summer, with a light facial moisturizer likeSimple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounceyear-round, and that keeps my complexion pretty clear as long as I useBiore Deep Cleansing Pore Strips, 24 Counta couple times a month.This was my first time trying a cream-based scrub. I thought it would be gentler than my usual apricot scrub, so that I would need less moisturizer in the summer, and it does in fact moisturize my skin in a way my usual scrub doesn't. However, it completely fails as a scrub! It takes forever to rinse the cream off my face because it's so heavy and waxy, and two days after I started using it the hollows under my cheekbones broke out like they haven't in years.I guess this'll teach me to mess with a system that was already working. . .", "I work in a factory and I routinely shower directly after coming home from work. Still I experience blemishes. I started using Biore Pore Unclogging Scrub and watched the blemishes reduce to really nothing. How could you go wrong with Biore?", "Im in my mid 30's and going through this weird adult acne/ seriously dry skin phase all of a sudden. I have to be really careful about what type of cleansers I use because I don't want to irritate my skin and make it worse. After finding the right cleanser I realized that I needed a good exfoliant to get the dry flaky skin off. I started using this only in the mornings (while I shower) and I love it! The texture is of course gritty, but it doesn't have an offensive smell and most of all it's not tingly on the skin. Don't you just hate those tingly feeling cleansers? Ugh! It's like they're supposed to make your skin feel clean all for the purpose of convincing you that your skin if officially clean, haha! It has no actual benefit to it whatsoever. Ok back to this scrub! I use a dime sized amount and work it into circles all over my face. There is no residue or icky after effects. It gets the dry skin off without irritating my skin and that for me is huge!! So far I'm hooked and will repurchase this scrub once I'm out.", "\"My skin is actually pretty clear except for a tendency to develop whiteheads (or blackheads on rare occasions) on my nose. In the past, I have used Biore strips to remove them about once a month, but the strips tend to tear a bit at my skin (sometimes breaking fine blood vessels or leaving some read patches) and I can only use them irregularly. I wanted to try this as a way of dealing with this problem with more regularity and less potential damage.At first, I tried this on my entire face, but I found it left some red patches on one of my cheeks. The little blue beads that act as gentle \"\"pumice\"\" for exfoliating are a bit too much for skin in some areas, but it doesn't seem to be too harsh for my nose. After the first two days, I just focused using it on my nose and thoroughly (though not excessively) rubbed it in. The first day, I didn't see much change, by, by the fourth day, I could notice a difference in my pores. It is, slowly, starting to unclog them and clear out the whiteheads.One thing I noticed, however, is that just after scrubbing, the skin can actually look worse, but it looks better the morning after using the scrub (I shower at night). I think the alcohol in it causes mild swelling that can make the pores look worse in the short term. That being said, it's supposed to help dry out the oiliness and help clean skin more thoroughly of sebum (the build-up of which causes the whiteheads). It also produces a pleasant and mild tingle on your skin after using this scrub.It's important to keep in mind that each person has different skin with varying properties. I can talk about how this product interacted with my skin, but that's no guarantee that others will have the same experience. I think that regular use will likely result in cleaner skin, but each person's mileage may vary. This might be too weak or too strong depending on your skin's properties.\"", "I've always used many of Biore's Skin Care Products, my favorites being the peel strips and pore unclogging scrubs. Using this basic pore unclogging scrub was quite a surprise, as Biore has obviously changed it. Instead of a nice deep cleaning from the product, I now got a deep burning from too many chemicals, alcohol and acids.I don't know why Biore changed the old deep cleaning scrub, as it was a wonderful soft cleaning that left your skin nice and soft, in comparison to this different one leaving it burning and irritated. At least they haven't changed the cleaning peel strips. As for deep cleaning, I'll use a nice refreshing clay mask that won't burn my skin with chemicals."], "Gamma": [0.04347870498895645, 0.04786093160510063, 0.04269339516758919, 0.043256063014268875,
