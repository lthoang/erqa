"], "reviews": ["I've been impressed with every cleanser by Biore I've tried, and have tried several now. This one is excellent. It has no fragrance, rinses away cleanly, foams gently, and leaves my skin smooth and glowing, with no residue. It also makes my T-zone look good, and shrinks my pores in that area. It takes off makeup easily too. I can't find anything bad to say about this. I would definitely purchase this when it runs out, although the bottle is a generous size so that may be awhile.edit:I upped this from four to five stars.  I decided I love this.  I have oily skin and large pores in my T-zone and this shrinks them down to nothing.  I love the lightweight foam this dispenses, the lack of any scent, and best of all, my skin looks and feels super smooth, firm and amazing without any dryness.  This rinses away very easily and cleanly, but I can't stop touching my face after I use this.  It's like I gave myself a great facial mask that tightened and smoothed.  I'm hooked on this and so glad I tried it.", "On days when I wear makeup, I need something with an exfoliant in it to help scrub it all off. The foundation I wear is a strong color-stay version, and between it and all the mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, etc, I need something with a bit more texture to it to help scrub it all off. However many days I don't wear any makeup, or just a light layer of Bare Mineral powder foundation and some eye liner and mascara. On those days, this Biore cleanser works well for washing it off.The foaming formula feels as light to wash with as the powder is that it washes off. It feels refreshing to the skin and is easily rinsed off with a splash of water. I find washing my face with this an effortless task, so I'm much more likely to wash my face before going to bed when I don't wear makeup using this, rather than just skipping it and going to bed with the day's oils still on my skin.", "First off, I'm not a huge fan of foaming face cleaners (or any cleaning treatment).  This one is no different.  This one in particular feels like it's drying out my skin every time I use it.  It really does not feel very good.  I haven't noticed any lowered amount of pimples or other flaws.  No real effect on tone.  Nothing.Not recommended.", "This cleanser is a foaming cleaser, which I love. I just think there is something so cool about pumps that aerate things and make them all foamy. I tend to be a little heavy handed when I'm dishing out products, so foaming cleansers are great for me, because you are less likely to use too much. This cleanser is very light, which is generally the case with foaming products. It has a neutral smell and leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I couldn't really tell a difference is skin healthiness between this and the many other over the counter cleansers I have used in the past.", "This is a foaming cleanser. It has a nice pleasant fragrance with just a hint of a chemical smell to it, but overall, was nice. it did a good job of cleansing my skin and did not leave it dry or irritated. It is a `deep cleansing' cleanser so I don't use it as my daily cleanser, but just once or twice a week.", "\"I'm more of a Neutrogena fan than a Biore fan, but the performance of this face wash has got me thinking of switching brands - it's a very nice product all-round.It's packaged as a foam-type dispenser that meters out enough for use without any waste. Given the price of face cleaners, being able to stretch the amount used is never a bad thing!But regardless of how it is packaged, the reason for using it is performance. For me, it works very well. My face feels clean and a little \"\"tingly\"\" after use (with the latter due, I image, to the menthol in the soap). It does dry my skin a bit, but not to the point where it is at all bothersome.The scent is hard to describe. It's not at all bad, but just hard to put my finger on. Not soapy, not perfumy, but it certainly is not unscented either. I guess the best word is \"\"interesting.\"\" Regardless, the scent does not linger after rinsing (another plus for me) so even if you don't care all that much for it, you won't be smelling it all day.I haven't used Biore products in quite a while, but this is working so well that my next purchase will be Biore rather than Neutrogena. Highly recommend.\"", "Generally speaking I usually like most Biore products. This would probably be my least favorite product so far. It has a light scent that smells nice and foams really well. I feel  like it does a decent job of cleaning my face but also dries my face out too much. I have tried quite a few different face cleaners and this is the only one that has dried my face out so badly. I have somewhat oily skin to start so I would hate to see how badly it would try your skin if it wasn't oily. I am really not big on foam cleaners as well and it needs some grit to it or something to give my face a little scrub. This face cleaner isn't bad but it's apparently not a good fit for my skin type and I won't be using it again.", "I love the Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser. It's a foaming cleanser that smells and feels refreshing on your face from the eucalyptus extracts. It cleansed my face wonderfully but still left my skin feeling incredibly soft and not dried out in the least which surprised me since it's an oil-free deep cleansing formula.The best facial cleanser that I've used in a while.", "Biore is a name that I trust in skincare so I was excited to get to try this new 4 in 1 detoxifying cleanser.  It is a foam cleanser with a pump dispenser.  One pump provides more than enough to thoroughly clean my face and neck.  The foam is very light but has a silky texture as you rub it on your skin.  I didn't detect much of a scent or fragrance at all and I have a pretty sensitive nose.  After cleansing my skin feels clean and tingly fresh.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it can be a bit drying if you have dry or combination skin.  My daughter, who is 15, has a more oily complexion and it is perfect for her.  Overall, I'd recommend this product especially for anyone with oily skin or occasional breakouts.", "i recently used a Biore product designed for combination skin and ended up very disappointed. So I was surprised that I liked the Biore 4 i4n 1 Detoxifying cleanser. I still get break outs but now I also have wrinkles (oh, the humanity!). Finding a product that manages both well is very difficult.The Biore detoxifying cleanser felt nice on. It was not irritating at all. It rinsed of cleanly. I did not get that tight dry feeling that often follows washing. While I am not at all sure that my face needs to be detoxed (it doesn't get out much) this did feel like a good product. I used it over several weeks and it did not irritate my dry old lady skin or my cause more annoying acne.I recommend this for combination skin.(and obviously any skin that has a drug problem and needs to detox)", "Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser is my favorite among all of my skin care producs for daily use. I feel like the foaming cleanswer is really helping. My face feels cleaner and refreshed after use without the drying that I have with many other face products. I still get breakouts about monthly (probably related to hormones) so I have to supplement its use with salicylic acid containing cleansers as well.The cleanser foams which makes it lather well for quick and easy distribution, scrubbing, and then rinsing.It has a very neutral scent, which is neither attractive nor repulsive. This is a big plus for me as most of the scents in skin care products drive me nuts.So I recommend without reservation Biore 4 in 1 detoxifying cleanser as a daily use scrub.", "I have sensitive skin, but not overly sensitive to where everything breaks me out. I also wear a full face of makeup nearly every day. I am giving my intial thoughts, because I've only used the product twice so far. I will come back at the end of a week and compare. If anything is wrong, by the end of the week...I will know it!I chose this and the Biore Daily Cleansing wipes. The first evening, I removed my makeup with the wipes first, and then I washed my face with the detoxifying cleanser. (normally I wash my face twice, once to remove makeup, once to cleanse skin.1. You do not need a lot of the product2. The consistency was fine with me, it wasn't very foaming, but good enough (no mess)3. It has a pleasant smell, almost like a peachy smell to me which is a plus!4. There is a tingling sensation (menthol to give you the feeling that wow this stuff really works! But for me it actually does. I was able to remove the remainder of the makeup that was left after using the wipes.I did use it the next morning first and then I used the wipe just to see if my face was clean and it was. My only thing thus far is after washing, I recommend using your moisturizer. I don't know if it was the cleanser, but after washing and applying my moisturizer and makeup I see a bit of a glow.UPDATE AFTER ONE WEEK:verdict is in..I love this product!! I have no complaints. It works well, it doesn't dry out my skin(I do use a light moisturizer) and I can tell the differencein the overall appearance of my skin.", "Well, it does the job. It is keeping my 15 year old daughter's face looking great. I tried it but it was a bit drying on my skin (though I have very dry skin). My teenager hasn't been complaining about it so I am thinking she loves it. I would recommend this to people.", "\"This cleanser is billed as \"\"detoxifying,\"\" and I have no idea exactly what is meant by that.However the packaging suggests that the product will leave skin feeling \"\"refreshed.\"\" Apparently this sensation is meant to be accomplished by the addition of menthol to the product. When I first tried this product, I noticed it gave my skin a tingling, slightly burning sensation that I did not like at all. Reading the ingredient list, I found menthol which is a known skin irritant that I am quite sensitive to. Had I know about the menthol in the product, I would not have wanted to try it. On the plus side, the cleanser does have a mild, fresh fragrance and a light, pleasing lather. If you are not sensitive to or actually like menthol, you may like this inexpensive cleanser. If you find menthol irritating, you should avoid it.\"", "\"I used this twice before looking too deeply into the ingredients list. Both times, I felt it has a slight medicinal/chemical smell to it-- not disgusting, but not my favorite. It's a decent amount of foam and it glides across the skin easily and rinses off cleanly. Unlike several others, I didn't feel it was drying-- maybe because I'm used to a different foaming cleanser that strips away oils even more. Anyway, I was left feeling like it worked fine and was pleasant and priced fairly, and I'd use it as a \"\"back-up\"\" to my favored product. Until...I read the ingredients. Like reviewer Amanda Devon, I care about the ingredients in my health and beauty products. Unlike her, I don't necessarily understand what all those terms mean. I know I've heard that certain things are bad (PEGs, parabens, SLS, etc.) and I just try to avoid them, without looking too deeply into what each one is or does. But this time I decided to read just a little further because her review interested me. I read about each concerning ingredient on the nonprofit Environmental Working Group's Skin Deep database. And what I read made me decide to throw this product away... just not worth the risks, in my opinion. There are too many known irritants here, and potential carcinogens.Interestingly, using dangerous products on your skin or hair may be MORE dangerous than eating the products because your digestive tract has enzymes to break down chemicals and excrete them from your body fairly quickly, whereas when your skin absorbs them, they can get into your bloodstream and stay there for a long time. I didn't consider this until recently, so I was more concerned with eating organic than worrying about things like shampoos and face washes, which I figured couldn't do me much harm. Now that I know better, I'd rather make safer choices.\"", "This is indeed a refreshing face cleanser.My face felt really clean after using it. I particularly enjoyed the light herbal scent.All in all, this is a great product if you want to give your face a deep cleanse.", "I have used Bior&eacute; nose strips off-and-on over the years so I was curious how good their cleanser would be. As it turns out, it will clean your face, but then leave it a bit dry, requiring the addition of a moisturizer.", "\"I have used Biore&#8242; products for several years off and on.  I was disappointed when Biore discontinued the self-heating masks.  I always got a kick out of having a blue Smurf face.I am not really sure what the 4-in-1 part of the name is referring to.  To me that would suggest the product does four different things in one product.  The product cleans your face.  I guess one can argue that it cleans, stimulates, detoxifies and refreshens.  That's four things.  The one thing it doesn't do is moisturize.  But it doesn't claim to do that.The ingredients in this deep cleansing, oil-free formula are listed in order as follows:-Water-Sodium Laureth Sulfate (SLE and SLS are the bane of my existence!)-Coco-glucoside (a foaming agent which is not toxic like SLE or SLS)-Glycerin-Betaine (used in facial products for its ability to reduce the irritation effect of surfactants  [SLE and SLS], anti-inflammatory and anti-aging properties)-PEG-7 Glyceryl Cocoate (Another surfactant!)-Sodium CocoAmphoacetate (Yup, a surfactant).-Eucalyptus Globulus Leaf Extract (skin conditioning agent)-Camellia Senensis Leaf Extract (green tea used here as a \"\"detoxifier\"\")-Coco Nucifera (coconut) Water-Withania Somnifera Root Extract (Root plant originating from India: Withania Somnifera taken orally is known to have anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, anti-stress, antioxidant, mind-boosting, immune enhancing and rejuvenating properties.  It is also said to be an aphrodisiac.  I am not sure what it achieves used topically).-BHT (Butylated Hydroxytoluene.  This is BAD, BAD, BAD.  Research this and avoid it!).-Polyquaternium-10 ( a \"\"coating\"\" ingredient most often seen in hair care products)-Diazolidinyl Urea (antimicrobial preservative that acts as a formaldehyde releaser in cosmetics and personal care products.  This ingredient may be derived from animals. From PETA's Caring Consumer: Excreted from urine and other bodily fluids. In deodorants, ammoniated dentifrices, mouthwashes, hair colorings, hand creams, lotions, shampoos, etc.)  YUCK.-Disodium Edta (Chelating and binding agent)-Menthol (ingredient that gives the slight tingling sensation after using)-Citric Acid (preservative)-Propylene Glycol (used to absorb extra water and maintain moisture in certain  medicines, cosmetics or food products).-DMDM Hydantoin (DMDM hydantoin is an antimicrobial formaldehyde releaser preservative. People exposed to such formaldehyde-releasing ingredients may develop a formaldehyde allergy or an allergy to the ingredient itself and its decomposition products)-Benzophenone-4 (Benzophenone-4 ingredients absorb and dissipate UV radiation, which serves to protect cosmetics and personal care products. It doesn't protect your SKIN from UV, it protects the PRODUCT.  I don't store my facial cleanser in the sun.  Benzo-4 is a known allergen).-Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate (Used as a preservative, it is acutely toxic by inhalation.  High allergen warning).-FragranceOk.  Those are the ingredients.  Not a pretty picture.  But let's ignore the horror listed above for a moment and talk about how the product works.Instructions say to wet face, pump out product, massage gently and rinse off.  With the amount of surfactants in the ingredient list I thought this product would be foamier than it is.  The application was smooth and easy.  I used it with full makeup on because I wanted to see how well it performed as a makeup remover.  It did a great job with the foundation/blush and eyeshadow.  It sort of failed in the removal of the mascara (I don't wear waterproof formula).  I had to use a cloth to remove the mascara but the rest of my facial mess rinsed off nicely.After thoroughly rinsing, I pat toweled dry.  I immediately noticed a slight tingling sensation (the menthol in the product) that was not unpleasant.  I don't really know if this ingredient really benefits the skin or if it is just a psychological benefit.I did notice after 5 minutes of air drying that my skin starting feeling tight.  I fought with myself about applying my favored night time moisturizing cream because I wanted to see if the cleanser itself would cause any irritation to my semi-sensitive skin.  It did.  After ten minutes the tingling sensation was gone but the dryness prevailed and my cheeks felt hot.  I looked in the mirror and there was noticeable redness.In my opinion, this product cleans but the DEEP CLEANSING claim is really saying it will strip your skin of all moisture.  I had to double the amount of my nightly moisturizing cream to negate the effects of the harsh ingredients in this cleanser.If you are even a teeny bit sensitive to products I would really avoid this product.  I overall was a fan of Biore but honestly, after researching the ingredients found here I am just going to have to say \"\"Good Luck and Goodbye\"\".\"", "Bior&eacute; 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser is a thin foam with a moderate scent of eucalyptus.  It is very effective at cleaning the face, even the oily areas.  It rinses thoroughly and leaves the skin feeling fresh and taut and even a little tingly for a minute or two.  It's very refreshing and the smell is relaxing.", "The cleanser removed make up and any impurities without problems. One pump is enough for the whole face.My complaint is that some of the ingredients are harsh and not suitable for sensitive skin (for instance sodium laureth sulfate). I have a normal complexion and realized that after about a minute skin was getting tighter (pores where shrinking ok, but the feeling was annoying) and I had to apply moisturizer.At the same time skin wasn't very dry, and I had a feeling that cleanser didn't stripped the moisture. But tightening effect was so strong in comparison to other cleanser I've used in the past that I think it actually did stripped all the moisture and there was some kind of film left afterwards (from one of the ingredients).Overall I wouldn't recommend it for dry/normal skin.", "Biore is my go-to drugstore brand skincare line, and I love this four-in-one cleanser. It cleans all the daily grime and makeup off my face easily, leaving my skin refreshed and unirritated. It's affordable and one bottle lasts a long time. What's not to love?!", "This is a very nice foamy cleanser that left my face refreshingly clean and tingling. The scent is clean and neutral  I did notice a slight tightening but my face did not seem dry.This definitely deep cleans and would recommend especially for young women.Update 4-18-13....After numerous uses this did dry my skin, recommend for oily complexions.", "I've enjoyed using the Biore Detoxifying Cleanser. I have skin that is more on the oily side and this product is excellent.I think the container is nice looking not that that really matters in how it works. The cleanser is dispensed by a push pump. It's not very easy to pump if you leave the container on the counter and just go to push it like you would a typical hand soap dispenser. You do need to hold the container in one had to pump it, at least that's what worked easiest for me. A single pump delivers more than enough for cleaning my face and neck.The scent is subtle and pleasing. It is not an exfoliating cleanser and seems gentle on my skin. What I like is the feeling of my skin afterwards. It is smooth, no oil and feels tighter. It's a great feeling.This may not be for all skin types, but for my more oily skin type, it works very well and I would definitely purchase this again. It seems like it will last quite a while as well.", "I always use face wash, instead of soap, in the shower. I thought this was a mild foamy face wash that was easy to rinse off. My face feels clean and fresh and the wash was slightly invigorating. This is a quality face wash and I will continue to use it, although it's not quite as fun as the steam activated Biore face cleanser, it is a close second. Plus, this one doesn't have to be used in the shower, it can be used in the evening over the sink or whenever. Good product and I will continue to use it.", "This is the strangest cleanser I've ever tried! I've used a lot of Biore products over the years and have found that most tend to be geared towards oily or acne-prone skin. I expected that this product would be stripping or drying to my combination/dry mature skin, but it really wasn't!It doesn't take much for my skin to feel tight and tortured with cleansing products, but surprisingly this light and foamy cleanser just made my skin feel refreshed. It has a nice menthol-y and pleasant aroma and it makes my skin feel invigorated. It doesn't do squat to remove eye makeup, though. So I use my MAC Cleansing oil on my face first, and use the Biore on top to remove everything. I really like how fresh and clean it makes my face feel. Surprisingly it has not broken me out, burned, chapped, or made my face itch!If you have oily or mostly-combination skin, you'll probably like this. I have some areas where anything short of a cream just won't do well, so I'm liking this Biore as a spring/summer cleanser for drier skins but not in winter. I wouldn't pass this up for myself as a summer cleanser if I found a bargain, but with my very dry areas it wouldn't be something I could use comfortably all year. Still a nice product and one pump does your whole face. Very economical.", "\"Not clear what \"\"detoxifying\"\" this is supposed to do.  Skin does feel clean -- some minor irritations that cleared quickly but not overly happy with product.  The name Biore has a good  reputation however did not find it all that thrilling.I would highly recommend Simple products if you have sensitive skin.\"", "This foam smells and feels nice enough, but I can't say that I find it all that effective. The foam itself is also very limp and tries to slide off my hand before it reaches my face.The design of the pump is pretty nice, but I don't like the lid. I don't leave it on because it's fair impossible to get the lid off with wet hands.Foamy face wash is nice to use, but I recommend sticking with the other Biore cleansers, such as theBiore Blemish Fighting Ice Cleanser, 6.77 Ounce.", "I find that Biore products are targeted most to young people, who often have issues with oily skin and acne.  In that vein, Biore 4 in 1 Detoxifying Cleanser is a harsh cleanser that is hard on oil and contains typical soap ingredients like SLS.  I have pretty sensitive skin, but my only reaction was lightly burning eyes and dry skin.  The former felt very much like menthol, which was confirmed when I checked the ingredients.  The latter was not too bad, and my skin is normally dry, so using a harsh cleanser always has that result.  On the bright side, the scent is relaxing and the foamy suds wash off cleanly.Biore has created another decent product for oily skin, and if the price is right and you have issues with oil, I think it is worth a try.", "I really like this Biore Cleanser.  I blew off the 'detoxifying' and '4 in 1' verbiage as marketing-speak and focused on how it made my face feel.I like that it's foams gently. And I was absolutely surprised at how smooth it left my skin.  That said, it's going to have to be my Summer cleanser as it's a bit too drying for Winter.Definitely recommend --but with caveats.  It left my face clean and very smooth to the touch, but was drying.", "this made my skin feel tight and itchy I have combination skin and this product was far to harsh for it. perhaps a teenager with high oil could use this but I do not recommend it for anyone else", "\"The detoxifying angle of this seems to be tied up to some extent in green tea extract, but I'm not sure what makes this special as a facial cleanser beyond that point. However, it does seem to do what soap does and it can be applied more simply and is more enjoyable to use. The product comes out as a rather loose foam that is easy to rub on your face. It's just at the point of holding together enough to not slip out of your hands. This is surprising as I expected a tighter foam.Some people have said their faces feel \"\"tight\"\" after using it. This was not my experience. Though I felt tingling (from menthol in the cleanser), my skin felt good after using this. It was soft and clean without being too squeaky and didn't feel stripped. That being said, I didn't feel that I was getting the same level of deep cleaning that I get from the other Biore products I've used. However, it could be that I'm used to using the scrubs (especially for the pores on my nose) and I'm unfairly comparing something with scrubbing beads in it to a foam.I think this works fine, but I'm not sure if it is worth the added cost relative to a good bar of soap. The foam is convenient to apply and it gives skin a nice tingle and left my face feeling good, but no different than using other cleansers. If you're not happy with how soap handles your face, this is probably going to be a little better, but this also will cost more and creates more material waste with the plastic dispenser.\"", "I was exciting to try this 4 in 1 Biore facial product. Even though I enjoyed the foam consistency, I was truly disappointed with the after effects of the product.  It left my sensitive skin dry and irritated.  It cleans but it striped my skin of moisture which is not a good thing. Definitely not a product for me, but if you have acne or oily skin, I would recommend giving this product a try. I gave it to my 16 years old niece; and, it has cleared her skin. If your skin is sensitive or dry, I would not recommend this 4 in 1 cleanser."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03137225657701492, 0.025748800486326218, 0.03232664614915848, 0.033490054309368134, 0.034529730677604675, 0.01748621091246605, 0.032914601266384125, 0.027384888380765915, 0.03194398432970047, 0.032494526356458664, 0.027176721021533012, 0.035236161202192307, 0.03292042762041092, 0.031741831451654434, 0.03447066619992256, 0.03363887593150139, 0.031914059072732925, 0.03016923926770687, 0.029155949130654335, 0.031750112771987915, 0.029079066589474678, 0.0348605178296566, 0.03228022903203964, 0.03271489217877388, 0.03303806111216545, 0.033029526472091675, 0.03400258719921112, 0.02712908945977688, 0.028586432337760925, 0.03274725750088692, 0.03230680152773857, 0.03235980123281479]]}
