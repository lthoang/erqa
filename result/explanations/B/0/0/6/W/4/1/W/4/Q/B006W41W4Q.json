These are not inexpensive so I would steer clear if you are an occasional user and just put on a headset when you want to chat lightly in-game, or shield others in the room from game sounds.What's in the box?* XP400 Wireless Headset* XP400 Transmitter* Digital Optical Cable  (approx 4 feet)* Headset Charging Cable (12 feet)* Bluetooth Chat Adapter* User Guide* Turtle Beach StickerThe speakers in the XP400 are 50mm, 20Hz - 20kHz with Frequency Response.  The amp 27mW per channel ch, THD &lt;1%. The built in microphone (removable, by the way) has a response of 50Hz - 15kHz.Set up is fairly simple.  If you can play Call Of Duty, you can do this!  Just charge the unit, connect it to your Xbox (or PS3), and away you go.  The connections are a fiber optic cable and a transmitter/power (USB) cable.  If you have an older Xbox, you will need an HDMI adapter (not included).  Or if your TV has a digital optical output, you can connect that to the XP400's transmitter.SOUND:Incredible!  The surround sound on these things is full-bodied and reproduces every slight sound, every nuance in the game.  You may hear things you never noticed before.  I play primarily COD/MW, and the sound is fantastic.  You can play around with different Surround Sound \"\"angles\"\" on the XP400 to get just the kind of sound you prefer.  There is an equalizer, which has 4 presets (Flat, Bass Boost, Treble Boost, or Bass and treble Boost); you cannot adjust equalizer settings other than this.  I had no issues with sound quality whatsoever.  I have a few other wireless devices, including a phone and router about 5' from where I use the XP400 and had no interference.  The headset can select 2.4 or 5GHZ bands though, so if you do run into interference, hopefully one or the other works for you.  Wireless range is about 30 feet, which should work for most folks.COMFORT:This product is fuller than your typical lightweight Microsoft Xbox headset.  It is not overly heavy, but it is noticeably heavier.  It is, however, very padded and adjusts to a wide range of sizes.  I have found it to be very comfortable.FEATURES:The ability to switch to Bluetooth to take an incoming mobile phone call is very neat.  Pairing is simple.  As far as controls, they are all well-placed an intuitive.  There are controls on the transmitter for surround sound and pairing, while the headset itself is used to control (left ear cup): power, volume, tone, and mic, and (right ear cup):  Bluetooth, bluetooth volume, and mic mute.Chat Boost is another nice feature.  The feature adjusts the chat volume so that spikes in game sound do not make the chat harder to hear.The battery is lithium polymer.  My initial battery charge took a while (a few hours).  The battery is advertised as \"\"more than 10 hours\"\" in the manual and \"\"up to 15 hours\"\" in ads.  I've found I get close to 20 hours of gaming on a charge, and recharge can take place while gaming!  The battery does not appear to be consumer-replaceable, which is a drawback.Overall, the XP400 headset has beautiful sound and works very well.  It is easily the best gaming headset I've used.  It is pricey though, so you have to weight cost versus value.\"", "\"I have to admit, I had a few reservations about this coming out of the box. For one thing, the fit was tight. But after stretching out the headband its much better. The ear cup sits on your ear, doesn't cover it fully which adds to the discomfort. I guess they thought a cup large enough to go around an ear wouldn't look cool. Too bad, it would feel better. The ear cover is not a soft material like velor, so not as comfortable as it could be but seems durable. I am using this with my PS3, but it works with the Xbox 360 too. Setup was pretty simple, and it didn't take more than an hour or so to charge.  All initial problems I've had have disappeared. The one thing I can say about pairing, it says that you need to have your headphone at least 2 feet from the controller. I'd say more like 8ft because mine wouldn't pair until I got it back more than 5 feet apart. Overall, the best thing about this headphone is the excellent \"\"TRUE\"\" Dolby 5.1 that does not have the hiss of simulated surround AND it works on movies on the PS3, not just XMB games and apps like theWireless Stereo Headset. The quality is shockingly good. I played someCall of Duty: Modern Warfare 3and that game really doesn't have that great of a surround experience because of all the explosions going off. So I put inSaving Private Ryan (Sapphire Series)  [Blu-ray] and my jaw just dropped. The beach scene, while still on the boat, I could tell that firing was coming over my right shoulder on the beach, toward their boat. There are several settings that simulate different speaker placement. I just left it on the one it shipped with, number one. Now I know people will say, true Dolby 5.1 needs 5 speakers and a subwoofer. I don't know how they did it, but these sound as good, when it comes to telling where things are around you, as a physical 5.1 system. And you can even tell the difference in a lossless and lossy soundtrack with the XP400 because I compared Dolby Digital Plus titles on NetFlix with TruHD version on Bluray.To use this headset on the Xbox with a device like a wheel, you will need a wire from the Turtle Beach website for chat.ProsWorks with PS3 or XBoxEasy setupTrue Dolby 5.1 SurroundOn the PS3, surround works with movies too, not just XMB gamesExcellent frequency rangeEqualizer PresetsSurround PresetsOptical cable is included and longUSB Charge cable and one that is for the controller seem longSeems well builtYou can use it while charging, battery is supposed to last 10 hours between charges, more with Bluetooth off.Replaceable ear cushionsConsNo DTS decoderTight fit for those with larger headsThe Blutooth adapter for the Xbox only works on controllers, not other devices like wheels so you'll need tobuy a cord to chat.Price may be a little high.Ear cups are a little too small, sit on your ear and uncomfortable after a couple hours.Comparison with theTurtle Beach Ear Force XP300 Wireless Gaming HeadsetBasically the two headsets look identical except for the model numbers and a few difference in buttons. The XP300 didn't seem as tight a fit as the XP400. Using the XP300 with my XBox I find that instead of using an optical out cable, it uses an RCA connection. The XP300 has simulated surround vs the Dolby 5.1 surround of the XP400. The simulated surround though is very good with 4 presets, like the XP400 has, to change the simulated placing of the surround speakers.  The XP300 does a good job with simulated surround. I used 5.1 Dolby NetFlix movies to compare the two models with the XP300 used with the XBox and the XP400 with the PS3. It doesn't seem as precise as the XP400 where you can pinpoint exactly where a sound is coming from. Instead, the soundstage of the XP300 sounds bigger than stereo to create a 3D effect.  But if you get the XP300 and want to upgrade to Dolby surround, Turtle Beach sells theTurtle Beach Ear Force DSS2 Dolby Surround Sound Processorthat you can use to upgrade it. The best thing is that the XP300 doesn't have the hiss that the surround of the early wired Turtle Beach P21 model had.UPDATE 6/13The inside of the left band, about 2 inches above the ear cup cracked. The outside started to crack. I contacted support. I had to give them the serial number and after doing so they gave me a Returns Authorization. I paid for shipping and they sent it back Fed Ex. Took about 5 business days between shipping it to them and getting a new pair back. I consider this excellent customer service. Highly recommend.\"", "I must admit I was slightly surprised with the XP400 Digital Headset from Turtle Beach.  Normally I play games with my xbox (and playstation) hooked up to a fairly expensive full surround sound system. I didn't think the XP400 would quite live up to the experience I was used to but it did.The headset delivers full dolby digital and is very crisp and clear. It's extremely easy to setup on both the Xbox and the Playstation 3 and comes with a dual band connection so that it does not interfere with your wireless network (2.4 and 5. I chose 5 as my network runs on 2.4).  Low bass noise as well as high treble and the ranges inbetween are very sharp and not tinny in the high range nor distorted in the low range.The in-built microphone works well for chatting whilst playing games and hearing other players' chat is much better than using the chorded Microsoft headphones that come with the Xbox.There are a couple of downsides to the XP400, hence why only a 4 star rating rather than 5.  The first of which is the tight fitting of the headphones.  Over time and use however I expect this to loosen slightly and be more comfortable.  The other is the actual padding on the earpieces. Out of the box it feels quite solid and abrasive however again with time and use I think this become more tolerable.The XP400 headset isn't exactly cheap, weighing in at nearly $200 however they are fairly comfortable to wear and the sound quality is excellent.  If you have children (or a spouse) who likes to play games loudly in one room whilst you are trying to watch TV in another, I can definately see the XP400 being worth the investment.  Even if that is not the case, you may wish to consider these for the excellent sound quality.Recommended.", "This headset, although not cheap seems to have nice features.  Problem with mine is that it won't pair to the wireless adaptor.  My headset seems to have a number of issues and as result will be returned.  After many attempts the headset will just not pair to the wireless adaptor.  In addition, when trying to pair I have tried to turn the headset off but it will not turn off.  I press the power button to turn off and it won't until the battery runs down and then it starts to beep for the battery warning.  So obviously a defective unit that needs to be replaced.  If mine had worked the headset has nice features and would probably be a nice headset.", "Buy other Headset. This is my last turtle beach. I spent about an hour last night not playing GTA 5 but trying to pair these dam things...  The seem to never come ready to go.  You always have to pair them to the transmitter and the manuel gives wrong instructions.  Got on the website for support and found everyone was having the same problem... They gave the &#34;right&#34; instructions and many found that it work but Im still not able to pair it.. Will try again today before I return them and never buy Turtlebeach head sets again.  I had the x41s and they were awesome just bought these ones because I buy tons of games and extras but no more of my money going to turtle beach.  If these dont work buying a50..", "\"I've had and been playing with this headset for about 2 weeks now and I must admit, TurtleBeach finally got it right. Last year I bought the PX5 which I had to return due to background noise and crackling sounds, plus interference with my 2.4GHz router. So this time around, I was a bit hesitant, I've been looking for a decent headset to use during late night hours, so I don't keep my wife up. I looked into Razer, but heard complaints from many gamers about the overall comfort of the headset, so I kept on looking. Finally, I stumbled upon these cans and the first thing I noticed was that it now works at a 2.4/5GHZ Dual-Band WiFi frequency, which is a big plus, specially for those who have a standard 2.4GHz router. I will go into more details..Package contains the following:1 XP400 of course, 1 receiver, 1 VERY cheap optical cable, 1 bluetooth chat receiver for the 360 controller 1 set of instructions. What I wish we had gotten: replaceable batteries instead of built-in, a better quality optical cable and a stand for the headsetNow the features and performance....Frequency:As I already stated, these cans have a dual band frequency, which so far has done its job. I have not experienced any of the issues I had with the PX5, the sound is clear, crisp and there's no background hiss or noise. The headset will chose the frequency that best suits the environment; if you have a wireless network with a standard 2.4 router, then you will benefit by getting the XP400 instead of XP500 which uses a single signal frequency at 2.4GHZ, which is the same as last year's PX5 that had the same crackling and interference issues. Anyway, back to the XP400... these use a dual bluetooth signals for voice, meaning, you can place/receive calls while gaming; one of the chanels opens up and the other closes while the call is ongoing, once you hang up, the chat chanel re-opens, making the entire phone call private. Nicely done.Design:The design is exactly the same as the the PX5 and now the newer XP500. Padded head strap & ear cups, plastic construction. The receiver is about the size of a dish washing sponge. The mic. as with the other models, can be removed. Also, the cups can be swung side ways, so if you must rest in between sessions, no need to take these cans off, simply put the cups on their sides and let them rest on you. It includes a wireless chat adpater, which uses Blue-Tooth signals, both the chat and headset come already paired; if this is not the case, pairing is explained and simple to do. The receiver also comes paired. Chat quality is clear and I did not notice any signal drops. There's an option to have wired chat, in case you use the Xbox chat pad, which can't be used (won't fit) with the wireless option. You will need an OPTICAL output from your Xbox, PS3 or whatever you are using these for. An optical cable is included, but its quaility is questionable. Get a regular quality 6 footer instead.Sound Quality:Much much better than previous models, you have 3 pre-setttings, bass, treb and bass+treb tweaks. So you can chose to have more bass, treb or both. I like the latter one personally. I tested games such as Max Payne 3, 50 Cent (for bass purposes) and BF3. I was quite pleased with the results, directional sound wasn't 100% accurate, but I'd say 90%, but then again, it also depends on the game you are playing. I did however, noticed that the max volume wasn't as loud as other models, I guess after years of blasting my surround sound system, I was expecting higher levels. Still, the sound from these cans, is superb. The receiver has options to turn the surround on/off and it also comes with surround paramaters, 6 in total; the instructions booklet explains them more in detail, they're basically positional parameters (side, rear, etc). By the way, the sound tweaks can only be done from the headset itself and the surround from the receiver only. All in all, the sound is great, however, consider this: this cans have only ONE driver in each cup, wich is used for all aspects (bass, treb, etc), so don't expect surround sound system quality.Pairing with the PS3.The XP400 does not come pre-paired for chatting with the PS3, you must do this from the PS3 menu, pairing is easy, but the signal output was a bit tricky to get. I have a home theater system, so if you do, make sure that in the PS3 audio options you chose \"\"Dual Chanel Output\"\", or you won't hear anything on your XP400. Once that's done, they work flawlessly.The headset however, has its flaws and here they are:First, built-in battery, so if the case that yours die after numerous charges, you can't replace it without sending the whole unit in to Turtle Beach.Second, NO STAND. nothing. I would've settled for a stick with a hook on it. You must leave this cans wherever you can think would be a safe place, so your kid, your cat or mother nature won't knock it off and smash it on the ground. A simple stand with no connections would've been fine. But instead, we get nothing.Third, as with the PX5, the signal on these puppies dropped at a range of only 20 feet, there's a half wall where I was standing, so I wasn't at the other side of my house. The signal starting to crackle and finally dropped. This time around however, once I got back in range, the signal came back on its own without any issues. Unlike the PX5 that would suffer from signal hiss and popping.In conclusion, you may be tempted to get the XP500, because honestly, its base does look great, but it doesn't have the dual band that the 400s have, which can be a major performance factor in a wireless network. And, just as I said on my previous review of the PX5s, the XP500's reciever has only 2 digital plugs. One in, one out and at that price, more should've been included.So that's my experience so far with the XP400s, so far they have exceeded my expectations. With it's dual band frequency, improved sound and comfortable design, this headset delivers where others lack.\"", "Let me get this out of the way first: this headset has the best sound quality of any gaming headset I have ever used, period. Everything from high-pitched whines from spaceship engines in Mass Effect 3 to the deep bass of dragons crashing to the ground in Skyrim shine when coming out of the earpieces here. I was also incredibly impressed with the array of features, especially the ability to determine how directionally-oriented sounds are projected through the headset (like having a sound coming from 7-8 o'clock be projected as coming from 9 o'clock so you would clearly know to turn your head to the left).I was also impressed that the headset uses the optical-out port, but anyone with an older-model 360 will be forced to buy an adapter. I would have liked to see that included. I was also a bit peeved that the battery that powers the headset is not user-replacable, especially because my particular unit was giving me low-battery warnings even after I had left it charging for a few hours (these warnings came within the first 10 minutes of play with no chat). I also (rarely) got some beeps and drops *while* it was charging, which leads me to believe that they were getting some interference, possibly from the router in the next room. These problems got less frequent after I re-linked the headset to the transmitter a few times and used it more, so I'm not sure if that was just the system working out the bugs (much like the Kinect's calibration does over time) or just bad luck on my part.I'm still supremely impressed by this headset, and if my problems disappear I'll give this headset the fifth star, but the issues I've had, combined with the lack of an included adaptor, are annoying enough to me to keep this otherwise steallar product in the four-star range.", "I have to start by saying that I have never used any other headset than the one that comes with Xbox 360, so I don't exactly have much to compare Turtle Beach XP400 to. I have used smaller bluetooth devices with PS3 as well, but again, no other headset. That being said, I thought this headset was amazing.Firstly, it is really easy to set up and get into playing. The dual frequency for wi-fi is a huge plus and I had no interference at all and no buzzing ir hissing noises. There were no disturbances in reception. I used these in 2 different rooms on separate ends of the house. (PS3 is in one room & Xbox360 is in another). The reception was great in both ends of the house and the headset worked flawlessly on both systems.The headset itself seems very well made and durable. The ear cuffs are comfortable to wear, even for lonng periods. You can adjust the band to a perfect fit and have the mic in optimal position. As the Xbox360 is the only headset I have to compare this to, I will say that the Xbox set got really uncomfortable even after just a short time of use - 20 mins or so - and actually became painful. It also seemed like the mic was never quite positioned right and I was just constantly re-adjusting the whole headset. With the Turtle Beach, I just put them on, adjust them once and am good to go...I don't have to re-adjust them at all. They are comfortable.The headset seems all quality and is worth the price. There is no aspect that seemed cheap or cheesey. They didn't skimp on build quality anywhere.The receiver is small and won't take up much space at all.The sound quality is of course amazing. You don't realize all of the little sounds and impacts that you are missing, until you try these out. I really was amazed. The surround sound is just amazing. There is no cutting in and out either and sounds/noise from around you will not cut out the sound in the headphones. These are excellent if you want to ignore everything and everyone around you lol, as you will only hear what is going on in your game or your phone call, whichever you are doing at the moment. They provide true noise isolation. It is like you are actually in the game.Answering calls during gaming is simple and efficient. I had no problems whatsoever with that aspect either. I was using these with my Nokia and they paired easily. The call/sound quality is better than any bluetooth or earbuds I have ever used. There was never any interference with calls. It almost sounds like you are sitting right next to the person, talking to them.I really jumped from one extreme to the other with these - going from the (cheap) Xbox360 headset straight to the Turtle Beach. I had no middle grounds to compare, but I will say I definitely recommend these. I wasn't sure what to expect in any aspect - build quality, sound quality, ease of use - but I was more than pleasantly surprised. They more than surpassed any slight idea I had of how they would sound and operate and are definitely worth the investment.", "\"UPDATED: 2012-03-21: to include more details about the sound quality, and clarify the wireless device interference trouble:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been testing theTurtle Beach Ear Force XP400 Dolby Surround Sound Gaming Headsetfor several weeks now mostly with my XBOX 360, and to watch TV with, and I am ready to write a review based on my experience.On the whole, I found the headset to work fairly well.  The sound is good, the base is good, the directional sound levels are very good.  When the headset wasn't sputtering, popping, or cutting out, the sound was rich, and warm, and certainly sounded like \"\"true\"\" surround sound. If the sound was supposed to be behind me, if I turned away from it while playing the game, it became quiet, if I faced it, it got louder, and as I turned, it moved from ear to ear. I am not a sound expert, but the headset seemed, to me, to provide rich, full quality surround sound, when it was working properly in my setup at home.Setup was a breeze, you just plug in the base-unit to a USB power source (our TV has several), and plug in the supplied optical digital cable to the TV-out, and the base-unit IN ports, and you are all setup!  To connect the headset, simply hold down the power button until it beeps and starts flashing green, and you are good to go.  Volume is controlled with a simple roller wheel, and sound equalizer settings are controlled by a button which cycles through the various presets -- which tell you what setting you are on by the number of beeps (not the best design, but it works).I setup the system to work with my XBOX 360, and have done several Halo multiplayer sessions using the built-in microphone, and communication worked fine. I didn't test it with the PS3, but there are instructions for doing so -- I just don't have any PS3 games to play multiplayer with =)  The microphone can be unplugged and put out of the way, if you aren't using it.I setup the Bluetooth link to my Android (Galaxy Indulge) phone, and tested taking a call while using the headset.  It works fine, but I didn't like the Bluetooth connection draining both my phone and the headset's batteries, so I turned it off.The headset unit itself is sturdy, solid construction, and the padding is a nice slick mesh.  The whole unit just FEELS expensive and luxurious, if that makes any sense. I did feel warmer wherever the headset touched my head, after wearing the unit for more than 15 minutes, but not uncomfortably so. The unit charges with an included USB-mini(B) cable (a LONG cable (about 3 meters/15 feet), so you can charge and play at the same time).So, with all of those positives, why the 3 stars?  Quite simply, the sound keeps cutting out for me -- a lot.  Now, your mileage may vary, but in my household, we have a lot of wireless devices (here is a short list for you to match your own devices up with, to decide how closely your setup is to mine, and thus may provide the same problems mine did: internet router, wireless landline phone, wireless home security system, microwave, wireless laptops, our cellphones (which aren't on the same frequency, but contribute to the \"\"noise\"\" in the air), wireless blu-ray player hooked up to Amazon Instant Video, and the wireless video game consoles)  At any given time, at least 80% of those devices are broadcasting or listening over the air on their various communication protocols.  What that translated to, for me, was a lot of stops, stutters, pops, and occasionally outright cut-outs in the sound coming from the headset. I am willing to forgive the occasional stutters and pops, but when I actually miss dialog in a game (or when watching a movie, or TV), then I have to dock the product points.  I *DID* find out that the more devices I turned off that used wireless communication, the better the sound I got from the headset.  But, it is kind of a major bummer for me to have to turn off a bunch of stuff, in order to use a headset.Like I said earlier, my household has a LOT of wireless signals crowding the air, so much so that the dual channel nature of the headset was still being interrupted.  Your household may be setup entirely differently, and thus not suffer from the audio connection problems I had. In that case, add a star to the review for yourself.But, overall, for me, it was a 3 star experience.\"", "I've used the X41 and X32, which are great (all way better than any old school analog wireless headphones), but the are my favorite.  What you get her is the crisp clear sound of the X41/X31 with the 2.4/5ghz functionality of the X32/X42, which can eliminate potential interference issues with most WiFi networks.  That along with the lightweight comfort is really all anyone needs, but this ads pseudo 7.1 sound, bluetooth support (mono) for phones, PS3, and the 360 with included dongle.  It also throws in rechargeable batteries (last long enough), and a removable mic (I don't chat, so I have no need for that or the bluetooth).  The set comes pre-paired, but pairing is easy.  You get two inputs (one 3.5mm stereo jack and another TOSLINK input for stereo/surround).  It seems to favor the TOSLINK is present (doesn't play audio from both simultaneously), which is nice.  My TV only has stereo output, so I have these hooked up directly for most sources and also use the TOSLINK for my 360 (for surround).Range is good, but not great.  I can walk 15 feet into the kitchen with perfect results, but turning the corner causes issues).  In a perfect world there would be a bit more range, but as it is, I can't complain.  I uses these equally for gaming and TV/movies, and it excels in either regard.  I honestly hear details via these I don't otherwise, and I often forget they're on (causing me to confuse those subtle details with ambient noise in my environment).All in all, I love these.  To save a few bucks, get theTurtle Beach Ear Force X32 Digital Headsetif you don't need bluetooth or pseudo surround, as the audio quality is comparable (and excellent).", "\"About 2 years ago my fiance was complaining about the noise from my surround receiver and my gaming habit. I took the plunge and bought theEar Force X41and couldn't have been happier... except for the near constant popping and clicking I heard. Moving the receiver away from my wireless router fixed some of this, but still, I would get the pops at random intervals and it could be quite annoying. Don't even try to use the microwave if you have the X41s turned on and on your head!I then received aSteel Series Spectrum 7xBvia Vine and did a comparison to the X41s. The 7xBs were only marginally better at keeping down the interference and the extra features over the X41s really didn't make me want to move into using them day to day, so I went back to the X41s not long after my review for the 7xB.Now I'm comparing the XP400s to the X41s and I think I'm going to be sticking to the XP400s this time around.First, there is NO interference to be heard on the XP400s. You read that correctly, NONE. I put the receiver almost on top of the wireless router that caused all my issues with the X41s and the 7xBs and not once in 4 hours of playing like this did I hear even a faint pop or click! I even tried to use the microwave and... still, no pops or clicks! For many people this alone will be the single best reason to upgrade from previous Turtle Beach models.Pairing to the wireless controller communicator was done at the factory, so it really was a matter of: charge the headphones, plug in the receiver to the 360 (I used optical and replaced the X41 receiver), plug the headphone puck into the controller and power up the headphones. Powering up the headphones also turned on the wireless puck.You can control the volume of game chat with buttons on the right headphone, mute is also on this headphone as is the Bluetooth pairing for cell phones. Being able to pair via Bluetooth is also how this headset also works with the PS3. PS3 chat isn't bad, but not as nice for me as the 360 chat, for which these headphones seem to have been designed. I paired this to my phone and made a few calls - everyone thought I sounded OK, just a little tinny.Another nice feature is the mic gain control. This is what changes the mic sensitivity. With it turned all the way up, I hear a near constant hiss and those in my party commented that they could hear a lot of background noise, such as the heater running and family members talking in the background. I dialed this down, which eliminated most of the hiss, if not all, and my chat partners all commented that I was then quite clearly heard, however, I was still described as sounding \"\"tinny.\"\"One feature I really liked about the X41s was how no matter what volume I had the game volume set to, I could always clearly hear my party's conversations because they had some algorithm to figure out and volume match in game audio and raise chat volume when explosions and other loud audio is heard in game. The XP400 do as good a job as the X41s, which means it's quite a solid experience to hear conversation clearly as well as in game audio. The 7xBs had a similar feature, but it would actually audibly turn the volume down of game volume, which was kind of distracting, which was another reason I went back to the X41s.The detachable microphone is nice, and seems to be about the same as the X41, though the XP400 is a bit thicker and beefier. The connection seems to be the same, though I haven't yet tried swapping mics between the two. I preferred the 7xB due to the retractable mic, but that feature alone wasn't a big enough reason for me to use them all the time.In terms of sound quality, since the XP400s can use digital audio output from the 360 (and it can also take analog, that red and white connection), you get very clear audio and darn good surround sound as well. In terms of the X41 vs the XP400, I think the XP400 has a little bit of an edge in terms of sound quality. In game surround just sounds better with the XP400s to me. The XP400 also has the ability to change the surround configuration to 4 different presets, all changing how it mixes each \"\"channel\"\" of audio in headphone. I've tried all 4 presets and each does change surround configuration subtly. I find the original surround mode works best for my ears.Another nice feature is the preset \"\"equalizer\"\" modes. You can enhance nothing (what comes from the 360 is what you hear), you can enhance just bass for bigger explosions, you can enhance just treble for some dialog enhancements and other higher pitched sounds and then you can enhance both. I find I prefer the \"\"both\"\" option as it makes the audio sound a bit richer. All of these settings sound better, to me, than the 7xBs.There is one feature, however, that I am completely not happy with on the XP400s. The battery is rechargeable, which is good, however it is built into the headset. It is NOT user replaceable! This means that in 2 years or so, after many recharge cycles, I'll either be forced to buy another pair of headphones or send these to Turtle Beach to pay a fee to have the battery replaced. I absolutely hate this about modern day electronics. Absolutely detest it - built in obsolescence so that people have to spend more money with the company releasing the product. iPad, iPhone, many Android phones, other MP3 players, etc. It's a huge load of horse patoot in my opinion. I like the X41s because I can field replace the AAA batteries on my own. 7xBs, same thing, replaceable batteries. Not so with the XP400. Thankfully you can still use the headphones while they are charging, however this means they aren't always wireless. Nothing is more annoying than having the headphones die mid game and then have to plug in. Of course, this isn't a completely different experience over having to replace the batteries mid play either, just different. I understand the need for a more powerful battery given the added features - Bluetooth eats battery, being completely wireless eats battery and so on. Just because I understand the need for more power than a few AAAs, doesn't mean I like having to have planned obsolescence and not being able to purchase and replace the battery on my own.One thing that is an improvement is the XP400 actually gives you beeps to tell you the headset needs to be recharged. There was nothing more annoying with the XP41s to have them just die mid game, especially during multiplayer fighting as you stop hearing game audio AND chat when this happens. At least now I have about a 10 minute warning before the battery completely dies.Turtle Beach claims 10 hours of battery life on a single charge for \"\"normal\"\" use and 15 for \"\"optimal\"\" use. What I've found is I can actually pull off about 12 - 13 hours if I turn off the Bluetooth function and just use it for game audio when I'm playing on my own. Adding BT and chat all the time and I'm down to around 11 hours.Over all, the XP400s are a great improvement in every way to the XP41s in everything except for the battery being non-replaceable by the end user. Of course, the MSRP on the XP400 is about $20 higher than the X41s so there is that to remember.Pros:Great surround soundTrue surround sound, not simulated when using optical audioChat and game audio equalization (chat isn't covered up by in game sounds)Completely wirelessNo interference360/PS3 compatibilityCan be paired to your cell phone and used while gaming - no fumbling to put headphones down to answer a call10+ hour play timeCan be used w/ third party controllers (see Con below)A step above the X41sAdjustable microphone gain - if you want to hear yourself louder in the headphones, turn this up. If others in your chat can't hear you clearly, turn this upBT pairing to cell phoneCons:Tinny chat sound during party chat on 360 according to those in my partiesBattery isn't user replaceableThird party (or 1st party wheels) require a cable for chat, which is NOT included (THOUGH THOSE w/ THE X41s, the cable that came with those headphones DOES work)PriceyWhy 4 stars? That battery thing does really annoy me. IF you don't mind not having the ability to replace the battery and don't mind the price, these are a solid 5 stars.\"", "Turtle Beach has created an excellent Xbox 360 headset.The most amazing thing about these guys is the dual band WiFi to the base (2.4ghz and 5ghz) thus eliminating any interference that would cause hissing, popping, and or crackling.Sound quality is near perfect!The sound is as you would expect - explosions, gun fire, and choppers all sound perfect; the bass does not overpower you; it is present and it is clean/crisp bass (no distortion or overpowering).  If you haven't guessed yet...this was tested with Call of Duty (Black Ops and MW2) for war gameplay.  The bass does not remove the detail that would normally be lost; i.e. footsteps behind you; gun fire; etc...Xbox live communications were greatly enhanced, offering great voice quality for listening; the mic offered great quality to the recipients on the other end with my rather deep raspy voice.I also tested with my favorite racing simulators and the sounds were on par with what I would expect from headphones that were wired to my Xbox.  These games are where the surround sound stands out...you can actually pin point the direction that the intended sound is coming from.  Awesome.5/5 stars - excellent quality.  Price could be better - but not going to remove a star for that.", "Ever since I got into gaming, I have been a headset junkie. When you spent most of your PC gaming time playing co-operative games that require VOIP, it just seemed to work better for me than to rely on speakers and a standalone mic. As such, I've gone through more headsets than I could probably describe. Some have been awesome, others not so much. Since I've used and reviews plenty headsets in my time, I've kind of come up with a guideline for reviewing. When I use a headset, I grade it by four things: comfort, sound quality, mic quality and durability. I'm not really used to using headsets with my consoles (except for the mic/headset for my Xbox 360 when playing multiplayer games).  I didn't know how I would like using a console headset when I have 5.1 surround in my room already.  But let's get into the specifics.In terms of comfort, this was easily the most comfortable headset I've used in awhile. I have a large head and a lot of times headsets can give me a headache when first using them because they scrunch my skull.  That's not the case with this headset.  It fits comfortably and will be even more comfortable as time goes by.The sound quality is fantastic. The psuedo surround sound sounds good, though it can't compete to my receiver.  But it does a great job of balancing talking with game sounds, so that I'm never constantly changing settings (of which there are 8 presets).  It's very nice and sounds great.Durability is another area that's important, especially when you're spending over $200 on a headset. The XP400 is very durable. I like the way the mic works and bends.  It's also detachable.Mic quality is also very important to me because I use it to communicate constantly with my friends who are spread out across the nation. Mic quality is also something very hard to review. No one complains when I talk and it pairs well with my cellphone and no one complains with that sound either.Pairing the headset with everything worked really well.  It has about 15 hours of battery life.  If you're looking to spend in the neighborhood of $200, then this is a great choice in headset.  But I would recommend the XP510 if you're looking to spend this kind of money.  It works even better.", "I absolutely loved this headset until I quickly learned that I had an issue hearing some other users who have wired Turtle Beach headsets.  I use this headset on my PS3 while playing online shooter games.  I strictly play with a group of about 20 different guys.  2 of these guys have wired Turtle Beach headsets and there is some sort of issue that prevents me from hearing them.  I hear everybody else just fine and they hear me.  The first night I used this headset I noticed that I was having troubles hearing 1 of these guys (the other guy wasn't on that night) but didn't think much about it.  The next night I had the same issues and everyone was confused as to why I couldn't hear him when they could.  He could hear me just fine but I'd maybe catch 1 out of every 10 words that he said.  I'd never had an issue hearing him before so I didn't really get it either.  When we realized that we were both using Turtle Beach headsets he switched to a different brand and we both heard each other just fine.  I thought this very odd and stated that when the other guy that had a different Turtle Beach wired headset came online that it would be the true test as to whether there was a compatibility issue.  Sure enough, when he came online I couldn't hear him either when everybody else could.  I switched to a different brand headset and heard them both clearly.  I emailed Turtle Beach about this issue and the reply that I got was that there must be a problem on the other users ends, not mine. They tried to tell me that there isn't a compatibility issue because it doesn't work like that but nothing else makes sense.  None of the other individuals have Turtle Beach headsets so I'm curious as time goes on if I will come across other Turtle Beach users that I can't hear either.  Maybe it's just the wired ones, maybe it's all other Turtle Beach headsets.  I'm not sure yet but I'll update this review if I find out.I wish I didn't have this issue because aside from that, I really love this headset.  The headset was pretty easy to get started for the most part.  The User Guide is very user friendly and I had no problem pairing the headset.  I did however have a small issue at first after hooking everything up as the manual states, I wasn't hearing game sounds through the headset.  I called my husband up to see if he could figure it out and immediately he unplugged the Digital Optical Cable from the back of the PS3 and plugged it into the TV.  He said it was because of the HDMI cable.  After doing that everything was perfect.The surround sound is awesome.  It's neat to hear footsteps and know exactly which direction they are coming from.  I've found this feature to be very helpful.The sound is very clear through this headset.  The people that I do hear, they are crystal clear and I don't hearing popping sounds like I do with some of my other headsets.  Everybody says that I sound fantastic as well.  I like the fact that I can manually adjust the volume of the game, the chat and the my own voice in the headset all individually.  This is very useful.The battery life of the headset is pretty incredible.  Right out of the box without charging the headset I was able to use it for about 15 hours.  When the headset needs to be charged you are able to do it while playing.  It comes with an extremely long charging cord that I also find very useful.Overall this headset is great.  My only problem is the issue that I described at the beginning of this review.  Hopefully by some miracle this issue will fix itself but I've had the problem for 3 weeks now so I'm not hopeful.  As mentioned, I'm not sure if I'll come across this issue often but it's quite an issue when you play with friends for many hours and can't hear them.  I would recommend this headset with the warning that I described above."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.020749004557728767, 0.2165164202451706, 0.027133062481880188, 0.21262122690677643, 0.04333347827196121, 0.03430236876010895, 0.022685585543513298, 0.031234590336680412, 0.04146755859255791, 0.036023810505867004, 0.13103914260864258, 0.09645981341600418, 0.0827813670039177, 0.0036525875329971313]]}
