I have been gaming since I was 7 years old, but I've been losing my hearing a little at a time since I turned 30 - over a decade now. I own a nice pair of Sennheiser headphones, but I hate being tied to my stereo by the spiral cord - that is only 6 feet long. I've been less than impressed by the sound quality of other cordless headphones, and so I've been turning the stereo up and using the (not-always-available) subtitles option on my games. Nice to be able to read, but darn distracting during hours of Mass Effect.These headphones, however, blew me away. The response is excellent, and the stereo effect is incredible. I've only experienced a few scattered moments when the headphones crackled or briefly lost connection, but those have only ever been minor annoyances. The sound settings (tone and effect) offer many options depending on the particular game I'm playing - even if it is a little annoying switching to the best options each time I switch games.The charge lasts a long time, and the USB cable is plenty long to allow me to game and recharge at the same time. The microphone can pop off when I'm not using it, and I can walk quite a ways from the game before I lose the wireless signal.Overall, these headphones have been a wonderful addition to my gaming, and I don't ever want to go back.", "\"The XP300 is a fantastic headset that gets almost everything right.Pros:* Immersive high quality sound, comparable to the X12.* Mobile phone bluetooth integration works perfectly. When you receive a call,* Set up is painless.* Chat audio quality is excellent.* Battery life is decent--should get you through all but the longest sessions. Best to recharge every night, though.Cons:* Chat bluetooth turns itself off too frequently.* Difficult to tell if you have chat bluetooth activated/on until you go five minutes without hearing anyone speak.Tweaks/Other issues:* I played Mass Effect 3 entirely using this headset. At first my heart sank because the dialogue was utterly incomprehensible. A press of the \"\"sound field\"\" button made the voices sound perfect. Whew.* Turning the bluetooth on the controller on before turning on the headset appears to give a more consistent connection.* Be careful of leaving your headset on, walking away and answering a phone call on your paired mobile! The range is spectacular. Your phone will default to the paired headset if it is on.* You can get away with a few sessions without recharging the headset, but its better move to plug it in every night.* If you are connecting your xbox to your tv via HDMI, you probably need an analog work around to get sound to your headset.Here's Mike's original post (located here, if you want to mark helpful:Hdmi Cable and Adapter for Xbox 360)on how to do this:\"\"The cable that came with my xbox would block the hdmi port when plugged in, so I couldn't plug both an hdmi cable and digital audio in at the same time (my receiver doesn't have hdmi). However, it is a fairly easy process to remove the plastiic casing around the cable with the digital audio and then both will fit - and it works like a charm.Just take a flat edge screwdriver to the crease in the side of the casing, give it a light tap with a hammer if necessary, and the plastic casing will pop off. Once this is done, both cables fit without a problem. You may want to wrap with electrical tape once the casing is removed.\"\"Overall, I am very pleased with the xp300. It provides excellent sound quality while eliminating tethering wires. The design decision to have chat bluetooth turn off with inactivity in order to save battery life was not a good one by Turtle Beach, but overall this headset is as good as it gets.Highly Recommended. Less one star for the bluetooth chat issue, otherwise perfect.\"", "\"This is my second experience with simulated surround headphones from Turtle Beach. My older set is the wired P21 model (for PS3) from several years ago. For those that have had the older model, I have great news. This new model improves on both the quality of the build and has much better simulated sound. Gone is the hiss of the old model, this new simulated surround has hardly any sound artifacts and does a very good job. It comes with 4 presets for both surround and tone. Set up was pretty easy, using the RCA outputs of my TV. The device for Blutooth that attaches to the controller was easy to set up and you don't need the controller on so if you want to use something like a racing wheel, the controller doesn't have to be left on.ProsUse with PS3 or XBoxVery good surround effect, no hiss of older models, 4 presetsLightweight and fairly comfortableEasy to set upUpgrades to Dolby 5.1 with the Turtle Beach Ear Force DSS2 Dolby Surround Sound ProcessorSeems well builtLong battery life (I have used the near identical Turtle Beach Ear Force XP400 Digital Headset for 8 hours and didn't need a chargeYou can use it with MP3 players using the AUX inputCan be used while chargingEar cushions can be replacedConsSometimes you get weird sounds from the surround processor. I found changing the preset fixed it on the headset itself fixed it.Price? For PS3 users the Official Sony Wireless Stereo Headset does the same for half the price.If you decide to upgrade with the DSS2, it costs more than just getting the XP400.If you use it with an Xbox and a device like a wheel you will have to purchase a wire for chat.Comparison with the Turtle Beach Ear Force XP400 Digital HeadsetBoth can be used with the PS3 or XBox. Basically the two headsets look identical except for the model numbers and a few difference in buttons although the XP300 fit looser and was more comfortable. Using the XP300 with my XBox I find that instead of using an optical out cable, it uses an RCA connection. The XP300 has simulated surround vs the Dolby 5.1 surround of the XP400. The simulated surround though is very good with 4 presets, like the XP400 has, to change the simulated placing of the surround speakers. But there is a definite difference with the XP300 expanding the sound stage for a surround effect while the XP400 gives you \"\"real\"\" surround in that you can pinpoint direction of sounds in 5.1 Dolby encoded games and movies.  The XP300 does a good job with simulated surround. I used 5.1 Dolby NetFlix movies to compare the two models with the XP300 used with the XBox and the XP400 with the PS3. It doesn't seem as precise as the XP400 where you can pinpoint exactly where a sound is coming from. But if you get the XP300 and want to upgrade to Dolby surround, Turtle Beach sells the Turtle Beach Ear Force DSS2 Dolby Surround Sound Processor that you can use to upgrade it. The best thing is that the XP300 doesn't have the hiss that the surround of the early wired Turtle Beach P21 model had.I did have to pick up the accessory cord for chat from the Turtle Beach website so I could chat using the MadCatz wheel. The Blue Tooth adapter that works with the XBox controller will only fit the controller so if you are using this headset with the XBox and a device like a wheel, you will need to get the wire from the website. The wire with shipping was around $15 and for whatever reason they will only sell you up to 3 so don't lose your wire. It includes an on off switch and volume. With this set up, turn off the Blue Tooth on the headset, you won't need it, and that will increase battery life for a couple of hours.UPDATE: I am going to have to get the cord to use chat with my Madcatz wheel. Its $15 from the Turtle Beach website, including shipping. Without it, I could hear people chatting but the mic didn't work or even show that I was using one in the room.Comment Comment | Permalink\"", "\"A couple of months ago I reviewed theSennheiser X320 Xbox Headsetand came away very pleased with them, once thing I loved about these was that it didn't need batteries to operate as it got power from the XBOX 360 console itself.  I had the opportunity to get these Turtle Beaches with similar features, but unlike the Sennheiser these are wireless.  Even though they are wireless they still do not require batteries because the wireless transmitter itself connects to your console to get power.The first things that drew me to this headphones was the fact that these are fully compatible with both my XBOX 360 and PS3 console.  With it being PS3 compatible that means it uses Bluetooth as well and Turtle beach took advantage of this Bluetooth feature to make it compatible with your Bluetooth phone, meaning that you can receive and answer calls while you are playing the game.  When you receive a call, the headsets automatically mute your in game chat and allow you to answer and talk to the person on the other in through your headphones while still playing the game.  This is a very cool feature because it's very frustrating being in the middle of an intense game having to stop to answer a call.Another cool feature of these is that there is an AUX in jack on the wireless transmitter that allows you to connect your IPOD, phone, or other music device and pipe music into your headphones while you play.Sound quality may be slightly better than the Sennheiser's but I noticed in NBA 2K12, that the announcer volume was quite muffled and drowned out by the crowd noise.  No problem, I just pressed the sound field button and it switched to a different sound mode, and then I could hear the announcers clearly.  This is a great feature because some games seemed to be mixed differently than others and the sound field button helps you get the best sound available for the game you are playing.  There is also an Tone button as well that allows you to switch between different combinations of treble and bass.  It should be noted that I didn't have the same sound issue with the Sennheiser so I am not sure why I did with the Turtle beaches before changing the sound field.  I think the basic sound produced by these headphones is good especially, but if you want true surround sound, then you have to shell out another 70 or 80 bucks to purchase an adapter.  To me, it's not that serious and I only use these headphones late at night when everyone is trying to sleep or when I don't want to be distracted by outside noises.In game chat works well with both the PS3 and XBOX 360 and the fact that the PS3 uses Bluetooth and the XBOX 360 does not is not a problem, instead of creating a brand new interface to work with the XBOX 360, Turtle beach just made the Bluetooth compatible with the XBOX 360 by using an included wireless chat adapter that plugs into the bottom of the XBOX 360 controller and connects via Bluetooth to the head phones themselves.  Pairing was a bit of a pain because sometimes it doesn't always work, but when it does it sounds great.  If you don't want to use the wireless connector, then you can use a wired adapter instead. (sold separately, of course)When fully charged, your headset provides up to 15 hours of gameplay before needing a recharge, but if you run out of a charge, not to worry, you can connect the included extra-long USB cable to the headphones and then to your console or any other USB enabled device and play while you charge.  Keep in mind you don't have to have the headphones connected to your console while charging, in fact I was using these headphones on my XBOX 360 while charging them via the PS3.These headsets are quite comfortable much like the Sennheiser's are, and considering how much time a person will spend wearing them during marathon gaming sessions they SHOULD be comfortable, and where the Sennheiser's  succeed, so do the turtle beaches.  The button placement and volume controls on the headphones do however take a lot to get used to, there are two volume controls for the game sound and in game chat, but there are also other buttons for Bluetooth pairing, power button, chat level, mute button and a couple of others, until you get used to the button placement you will more than likely finding yourself taking off the headphones because you can't remember where everything is.  One area in which I prefer the Sennheiser over these is that to mute your all you have to do is rotate the microphone up over your head; with these you have to physically press the mute button.  However the mic arm itself on the Turtle Beaches is flexible and can be moved around in virtually any position you want, with the Sennheiser, the mic arm is rigid, and may be prone to breakage if you are not careful.While I am impressed overall with the sound quality and extra features there are a few complaints I have that prevent me from giving these headphones a perfect score.First, while I had no issues when playing the PS3, I would notice that the XBOX 360 controller would sometimes randomly disconnect from the XBOX console itself causing the \"\"Please reconnect controller\"\" message to appear on the screen.  Every time this happened I seemed to remember the controller reconnecting itself automatically, but even still, if you are playing a game that requires split second thinking, then these random disconnects will almost certainly mess you up.  I am guessing this may have something to do with the controller trying to work with the Bluetooth transmitter, but I am not 100% sure.  It's only happened a couple of times, and hasn't happened since. (crossing fingers)Secondly, on both the XBOX360 and PS3 the game sound occasionally gets lagged and garbled and sounds absolutely terrible.  This more than likely could be caused by interference with my other wireless devices in my home.  Which is another reason why I prefer wired whenever feasible.Finally, when using the in game chat, you can slightly hear your own voice echo while talking to others, the Sennheiser didn't do this, and neither did the standard XBOX 360 mic or PS3 Bluetooth microphones.  It gets rather annoying, and I haven't figured out any way how to turn that \"\"feature\"\" off.  To add to this, even with Mute on,  I can still hear outside sounds coming through the mic even though people in the game cannot.Speaking of Mute, Turtle Beach decided it would be a good idea to \"\"notify\"\" you with an ear piercing beep every few minutes or so, when you have Mute turned on.  This is a good example of them trying to do too much.  I KNOW Mute is on, I don't need to be notified with this constant beep.  I hate my answering machine for the same reason, the constant beeps are extremely irritating and to me are almost akin to the sound of someone clipping their nails.I also need to mention that in addition to the mute notification, I have also noticed other occasional out of the blue annoying beeps and tones that sound even when I have everything hooked up correctly and my battery is sufficiently charged and I haven't figured out what was causing these sounds.  On quite a few occasions, there also seems to be a persistent buzzing sound that is audible especially when the game volume is down and I have yet to figure out what causes it and and it comes and goes.  Recently it became real loud; even noticeable during game play, and I finally went to the transmitter, unplugged the line jack and reattached it.  I also moved the transmitter away from my consoles and that seemed to resolve the issue.  In any case, with my Sennheiser's, the only sounds that come from them are from the game itself and other players and that is the way I prefer; just do what you are designed to do and do it well.All in all a great set of headphones that work well and produce great sound on both the XBOX360 and PS3, but expected issues with wireless rear their ugly head possibly during the most crucial times of your games.  The voice echo and the occasional buzzing that comes from the headphones can get very annoying.  The button layout on the headphones themselves will not be very user friendly when you first use them.  Finally, the random R2D2 beeps can also get irritating if you are super sensitive to certain sounds like I am.While I like these, they are definitely not a 5 star product in my opinion.  They do produce great quality sound and when they are not buzzing constantly, I am quite pleased with them despite the other flaws.  I went back and forth between three and four stars for this product but decided to bump it up to a four because perhaps I figured out how to resolve the buzzing issue. Even still, I haven't used my Sennheiser's since I got these, but may switch back to them from time to time when the beeping, echoes and especially the buzzing become unbearable for me and I need a break.UPDATE 01/09/2013Over the past month or so, I noticed an annoying buzzing coming from the right headphone.  At first I thought it was due to interference of some sort or a result of the 3.5 mm stereo cable having a short in it, but I replaced that cable, and I still experienced the buzzing.  I later discovered it wasn't electrical, but a mechanical problem from within the headphone as if something has came loose and is vibrating.  I discovered if I squeeze the right ear piece while the music is playing the buzzing stops.  So in order to make this permanent, I just folded up some electrical tape and put it between the ear piece and the bracket that holds it.  (see picture for what I am talking about).UPDATE #2 11/04/2013The buzzing issue has become unbearable, even with the tape fix I described earlier this year, it still occurs.  As a result, I no longer use these headphones and have gone back to using my Sennheisers's exclusively.  These headphones lasted for a little over a year, and of course right after the warranty expired.  Dealing with products that only last for the warranty period is frustrating and as a result I am forced to bump my rating down to 3 stars instead of four.\"", "I love this headset. Being rechargeable was a big selling point for me. I use it to watch movies, and play games on my Xbox One. I also have the Turtle Beach DSS 7.1 (I have the DSS 2 as well, but I prefer the sound from the DSS 7.1 a lot more). Because this is just a stereo headset the DSS 7.1 and DSS 2 enable surround sound. If the headset dies while you're using it you can plug it in and still use it while it's charging. The charge cable is more than long enough to do this. Overall this is a great headset for a casual gamer. I got mine on black friday for $89.99, and I have zero complaints.", "I thought there were more cables than I would have liked, which left my entertainment area more messy than I would have liked. But that is my only complaint. Otherwise, I thought this sounded GREAT!! I've got a decent stereo system but sometimes it can be distracting to others in the house when playing video games. So I got this for my son and I to wear while playing video games.I was amazed and how well this sounded. In fact, the sound was so rich I had to take them off my head from time to time because I was thinking the sound was coming from my theater speakers and not this headphone. And they are very comfortable and I've yet to play longer than the charge, though I don't play as often as my son does, I must admit.I never used the bluetooth feature so I can't comment on that. I've got other bluetooth devices for my phone and didn't want to go through the hastle of re-pairing or anything afterwards.", "I was super excited to receive my XP300 because it seemed to be the headset that would finally fix the wireless headset dilemma on the Xbox 360. That in itself is worthy of a purchase, but thankfully the XP300 has so much more to offer. I have purchased headsets that claim to be wireless in the past but somehow they always manage to involve wires. Doesn't really make sense to me. I had all but given up on a wireless Xbox 360 headset when this brilliant piece of technology came around. It is TRULY wireless, involving plugging a small adapter into the top of your 360 controller (where a traditional wired headset would plug in) and the adapter communicates wirelessly with the headset. It's beautiful perfection. If you happy to be 360 AND a PS3 fan, you're in for a treat. I don't even have to get up to switch from 360 to PS3. Turn the PS3 on, the bluetooth detects the XP300 (after initial setup) and I'm golden. I can even use the XP300 with my PC, although it is a wired connection. Not sure why they couldn't offer a wireless option for the PC as well and even though I don't really NEED wireless for my PC, it would have been a nice touch. I'm not going to knock a star off for this minor gripe because it outperforms all my expectations in every other capacity.Sound is full and crisp and completely engrossing. Paired with the noise isolation, the XP300 REALLY puts you in the game. A high quality headset might not be on the top of most gamers peripheral list, but it's amazing how sound like this can completely transform your experience. I was immediately hearing things in my games I had never detected before. I had been using the cheap standard 360 headset which only conveys voice chat so this is the first time I played my 360 and PS3 games with a headset and it's just as amazing as the first time I used myLogitech G35 7.1-Channel Surround Sound Headsetwith my PC games. I had purchased a few headsets for the 360 trying to find a high quality wireless set, and there just simply aren't any other options out there. If you want TRUE wireless with your 360, you need the XP300. As for voice, my friends claimed that they could hear me more clearly with the XP300 over the standard headset and I would expect no less considering the price difference between this and the cheap headset. Incoming voices were much clearer and louder and I don't miss having to lower the volume on the TV to hear voice chat with the standard headset. The XP300 automatically turns up chat volume to compensate a higher game volume.Comfort is also high on my list as after long gaming sessions, a heavy or uncomfortable headset will make you miserable. I once had a simple behind the ear style headset for my PC and my ears would ache after an hour and I had to take it off. The XP300 is lightweight for it's size and supremely comfortable. The padding around the ears successfully blocks out most surrounding noise while being very comfortable. Some headsets tend to put too much pressure on the ears and sides of the head but that is not an issue here at all. I wore the headset for over 2 hours and I was still just as comfortable as the moment I put them on. The padding on the band that goes on top of the head is amply padded as well and has plenty of room for adjustment so that it will fit absolutely anyone.The rechargeable battery is invaluable as well. Since my son's obsession with Skylanders, I'm really done with battery powered devices that have to be replaced at least once a week with moderate use. There's no reason high end devices like this can't include a rechargeable battery and I'm glad Turtle Beach recognizes this. I can recharge the headset right from the console while I'm playing and I can't imagine a better setup. It ensures no interruption to gameplay, which isn't something most wireless headsets can brag about. This paired with the ability to talk on my iPhone while I'm playing makes this purchase a no brainer for any gamer. It's even replaced my bluetooth headset that I use for my iPhone because now I can listen to music through my 360 with the XP300. If you want a wireless headset that works with your 360, PS3, PC and bluetooth enabled phone, there is no better solution and it's well worth the premium price given how many uses it had.", "This wireless headset is easy enough to set up and use. They work for both Xbox 360 and PS3. I really like the treble/bass modifier. Unfortunately they are too huge! My hat size is just under 6, and my head swims in these things! The sound is nice. If you have a large head then these are for you.", "I wanted to upgrade from my Turtle Beach Bravo but waited til it dropped under $100. It's basically the same but this has bluetooth which makes this totally wireless. Lot of the Turtle Beach headsets requires a talkback cable from the Xbox 360 controller to the headset which can get annoying so the bluetooth connection is a welcome addition for me. I use this mainly for my Xbox 360 but also my PS3, Wii U (minus chat), smartphone (music and phone calls), PC, and TV. Had no problems so far. I already own the DSS for surround sound so I didn't need to get the XP400. The XP500 is an older model which required 2 AAA batteries which is a deal breaker for me. I've previously owned the X31 so it annoyed me. The XP300 has an internal rechargeable battery which can recharged from the bundled charge cable. It can be charged while still in use which is a bonus. For the price, I recommend this. If you want surround sound, get the XP400.", "I have used Turtle Beach headsets before and they never disappoint. This one is no exception! I have recently tried this product with my Xbox 360 and my PS3 and it is just beautiful. It hardly has any interference (if any at all) and the sound is just fantastic. If you want a Turtle Beach headset without the hassle of wires and possible static issues, I'd suggest you invest in this product!A great gift for the gamer who wants great sound quality. It is definitely worth the 100 bucks I spent and I may end up buying another one fairly soon for my friend!", "If you're a late night FPSer with a family sleeping nearby then at some point you're almost certainly going to have to consider a headphone solution as the loud guns blasting from games such as COD and BF3 et al wake folks kipping in the wee hours. As a person in that scenario I was happy to receive Turtle Beach's XP300 for review and I must say I'm incredibly impressed.Every set up is slightly different but the cables and equipment supplied in this package had me running in no time. As with most people these days I connect my 360 to the TV via HDMI and use the TV set's speakers. The Xp300 comes with pass-through RCA red/white cables which allow you to add them to your TV or receiver without taking up an existing output. So if your audio connections are limited, say because you have a roku, DVD player, apple tv etc you won't need to lose one or have to swap out the connections each time you want to use the XP300. In my case, I connected the RCA to the audio OUT on my TV. If you have a TV less than four years old then it most certainly should have the same output and is probably the easiest way to get your 360's audio to the headphones.The other end of the RCA is connected to the wireless transmitter which derives its power from a USB port on your 360. With that done you're ready to pair the headphones (if necessary) to the base transmitter and then finally pair the mic on off dongle which attaches to your controller and talks to the phones to mute team talk. Finally, hook up the other supplied USB cable to allow the phones to recharge during downtime. One nice thing I noticed was the 360 supplies power for recharging even when switched off so the headphones are always ready to rock. If it's all set up correctly you should hear game sound both through the headphones and the TV and then it's simply a case of muting the TV's sound.If all this sounds complicated it's not and I had the phones working in about five minutes. You can individually control game sound versus chat too which is an important touch when both are being fed to your ears from the same phones.The phones themselves are very comfortable and feel well made - not cheap, weightless plastic toys. And audio quality is stunning and strolling through the marketplaces in Assassin's Creed has never sounded so realistic and atmospheric. You know you can hear flies and insects buzzing about! It adds so much and really is quite remarkable. Thankfully, there have been zero interruptions in the audio, delays or dodgy static or any issues that have plagued some wireless headphones that I've had in the past and the EQ settings add a lot to the appropriate games.I didn't try pairing my cellphone with the set although that's a really nice feature to have, but if I had one complaint it's that the mic is only on one side - I know it shouldn't matter with stereo headphones but for some reason I prefer a mic on the right and you can't do that here.Aside from that I couldn't be more happy with this bit of kit. It's revitalized my late night gaming and the family is grateful too. At the price it's a must-have device for every 360 owner."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03872637450695038, 0.24155288934707642, 0.14756464958190918, 0.06486286222934723, 0.16534972190856934, 0.12193720042705536, 0.015062515623867512, 0.17787262797355652, 0.014540417119860649, 0.006725209765136242, 0.005805401597172022]]}
