I previously tried a balancing lotion from Nivea and oil control washes from other brands, but they did not seem to work.  I've been using Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash for a week and I notices less oil on my face and fewer breakouts.I am a bit concerned that ingredients sound like they belong in a chemical lab, but the bottle says it is gentle enough for daily use.  I trust the Cetaphil brand, so I assume it is OK to use this wash, plus it works for me.", "I have been using this product for three months now and I don't think that I'm even a quarter of the way through the bottle. I use it in the shower pumping 2-3 squirts of foam on to a cheap soft bristle face brush I picked up at Sephora that makes a world of difference. For those that have more oil or break out prone skin this is a real help. I rarely have a black head show up now which I couldn't say for the Simple brand I was using before. And while I still get the occasional pimple ( maybe once a month) I can keep it very much in control. I also treat my face with a great natural tea tree oil pad which I think is made by Jason.", "I am a fan of Cetaphil cream. I love the way it works! When I saw the Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash, I knew I had to try it.I LOVE IT!I like the foam. I like the way it smells. It smells like it means business. I also like the way my skin feels afterward. You know how some cleansers make your skin feel like it's stretched too tight? Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash doesn't do that. My skin feels clean and refreshed after using it.I recommend Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash!", "This stuff rocks.  For teenage breakouts and oily skin, nothing has worked better.  My teen reports that this does not leave his skin feeling too tight or too dry, just super clean.  The scent is pleasant and best of all it really seems to control breakouts - both the appearance and the intensity.  great stuff.", "The face wash is a foam and it takes 3 pumps to cover my entire face.  Unlike with the Cetaphil liquid, the foam feels like it is actually cleaning my skin and I get the satisfaction of having the suds wash away the grime.  I wash with this every morning and then follow up with the Oil Control moisturizer.I read complaints about the smell being medicinal or overwhelming for both products, so I was unsure about trying it since I am sensitive to smells.  Fortunately I had no issue with the smell at all and find it rather nice.  It smells subtly clean.  It does linger and probably more so in my case since I follow up with the moisturizer.  I like that the foam does not leave my skin feeling tight yet it feels completely clean at the same time.After I wash my face I put on the moisturizer.  The moisturizer smells a little like sunscreen, but I find it nice since it reminds me of the beach.  It absorbs quickly and is light and non-greasy.  If I wear any makeup that day, I put the moisturizer on first then my primer.  I have had no issues wearing it under my makeup.I like that it contains an SPF so I don't have to worry about adding an additional step to my routine. I have fair skin and burn easily, yet when I have been outside in the sun for several hours my face did not even get pink even though my arms did.I have used these products for several weeks now and there is a subtle change in the oiliness and shininess of my skin.  I have extremely oily skin so the true test will be when it is the middle of summer and it is 90+ degrees outside.  But after living with seriously oily and acne prone skin my entire life any improvement is awesome, especially at what I consider a reasonable price.Overall, the two products do seem to control oil.  Keep in mind that control does not mean eliminate, which the product does not claim to do.  Actually I don't want to completely eliminate the oil since that will help keep wrinkles at bay just a little longer than it would with someone that has dry skin.  I also like how simple they are to use and they are what I consider products with no-frills.  As a mother of four I do not like a high-maintenance routine since I do not have the time or desire to keep it up.  So this fits rather nicely into my morning schedule and still manages to work pretty well.", "I'm older, but still suffer breakouts now and then, especially during the summer.The wash does have fragrance, but I like it.  It smells clean and fresh and that is how my face feels after using it.I always apply a moisturizer after cleansing my face, but didn't think the wash left my skin feeling excessively dry or tight.  The foam is very light and sort of melts as you massage it onto your skin.  It's easy to rinse, which is a plus and the pump bottle makes it very easy to use.While I may use a different wash for winter months, this one fits my needs for summer months.", "\"My skin is what we call \"\"combination\"\" nowadays - dry in some spots, oily in others. My nose is especially oily, and while astringent keeps it under control, it's pretty harsh. I used the Cetaphil cleanser once a day for several days and it really did help on my nose and above my eyebrows, the oiliest parts. For a while it was fine on my dry skin, too, but eventually got a little too dry and moisturizer alone couldn't keep up. It's okay for every other day use for me as long as I stick to only the oily parts. The scent is too strong, and the foam is just unwieldy. It gets everywhere, though I do pump it into my hand and let the bubbles pop for a second before using it. This isn't a terrible wash, but there are such better ones around for the same price that I can't recommend this particular brand.\"", "This is a really great face wash.  It has a very pleasant light floral scent similar to baby wash.  It cleans well and leaves skin feeling soft not dry. It works well for me at 53 with oily skin, my 14 year old with oily skin and my 11 year old with sensitive skin. I have eczema on my hands and regular soap aggravates it, but this did not affect my hands. I would recommend this to everyone who needs a gentle to the skin face wash.", "Love using Cetaphil, and just reviewed the moisturizer. I got both the foam wash and moisturizer together and started using them together too.... Just love it. I have had no bad reactions even with my sensitive skin and I really like the smell - not too strong at all - and the feeling of the foam on my face. I've had some before that feel so oily and thick. This is perfect, and after a few weeks, I am still enjoying using it. Highly recommend the Cetaphil line.", "Our family has always been very enthusiastic about Cetaphil products - we consider their product line to be dependable, reasonably priced and most often very effective.  A particular favorite at our house is the Moisturizing Lotion.However,this lotion did tend to dry skin.  I very  much like the idea of a foam wash - so easy to use and rinse off.When the dryness began to occur I tried folowing it with the Daily Advance Ultra Hydrating Lotion but this  simply tended to exacerbate the problem for which I was using the foam cleanser.  Do think it would have been effective if it had not brought on dryness.Everyone's skin is so different and reacts in various ways to the same  product.  I may very well be the only  one affected by dryness.", "I've been using the liquid version of Cetaphil for years, normal to oily for myself and my husband, and gentle for my 8yr old daughter. I'm in my mid 30's and suffer from hormonal acne which seems to have been getting worse in the past few months. I had tried several other brands of cleansers formulated for acne control and they just dried out my skin and made my breakouts worse. I decided to try the Cetaphil foam wash even though I never liked foam products in the past. I'm thrilled to report that this one rocks! My skin is cleared up and has remained clear all month. My husband even commented on it and then started stealing the cleanser from under my side of the sink. My skin didn't dry out and the foam actually removes my makeup really well leaving my face feeling fresh and clean.UPDATE: I've been using this for over 2 months, around the same time I also switched my moisturizing to Avon Anew so while I can't be certain which made the biggest difference in my skin I can say that this has really changed things for me. I used to get monthly breakouts around my cycle... in the past 2 months I haven't had a single breakout!!! My makeup goes on smoothly and looks great. I'm still using my original bottle of this wash, it's not even empty yet and I use it 2x per day! Great product and I'm back to buy more before I do run out.", "This is a gentle, yet effective cleanser suitable for all skin types.  It does a good job of cleaning skin, but does not leave it feeling stripped.  It rinses easily.  The product is liquid.  The foaming is a result of the pump mechanism.  You may want to use more than one pump.  I do because I wash my face, neck, and decolletage.This product contains no sulfates, but does contain a masking fragrance.  The masking fragrance is the last ingredient listed, and does not adversely affect my skin.  I mention it for those who are very sensitive to fragrance.I could not smell the masking fragrance.  The product seemed unscented to me.  I would recommend this product for the entire family, except very young children and infants.No anti-acne ingredients will be left on the skin after rinsing; however, due to its ability to clean so gently and effectively, I do especially recommend it for acne sufferers", "\"I have slightly oily, acne-prone skin that's been kept under good control for about a year with Skin Effects Gentle Foaming Cleanser and semi-regular peels. Still, it's not perfect, and I figured I'd give this a try. My facialist had recommended Cetaphil as a good brand.I didn't have the problem with the scent that others had. I'm prone to migraines triggered by scents, so I'm very sensitive to any sort of scent on my face-- particularly floral-- and this didn't bother me. I thought it was very light and unobtrusive. The foam itself felt fine going on.When it washed off, my face didn't feel stripped-- which is sort of a negative for me. The Skin Effects does make my face feel totally oil-free, whereas this one left it feeling sort of moisturized. I thought, \"\"Well, that's probably better for it as long as it keeps the acne under control.\"\"On day 3 or 4 of using this product, my skin broke out... and got worse for the next 2 days. It's one of the worst breakouts I've had in years. I'm still battling the breakout, but wanted to give my skin a fair chance to get adapted to this new product. Now I'm giving up and going back to my old routine.\"", "I love the smell of Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash. It's got an old school scent that reminds me a lot of the creams and such my grandmother used to use. It's not exactly medicinal, but it's also not overpoweringly feminine. This is definitely a product both men and women alike could use.I found its claim to be oil controlling true. My skin is less oily and therefore I have less breakouts. It didn't do much to speed up the healing of current blemishes, but is obviously preventing new ones. I especially like that it doesn't dry out my skin. For some reason, most facial cleansers make my forehead extremely dry to the point of peeling and moisturizer can only do so much. I haven't had that problem while using this foam wash.", "This is an excellent light face wash.  I've used similar products to this before, but this product is different in a few ways.  First it is a foam face wash, so its very light, which I found after time to be quite pleasant. The face wash also does not dry out your skin too significantly.  I have found with other products that at times they can dry out my skin, this product was a little better in that regard.  It also leaves your face feeling fresh and clean after use.As far as the cleansing power of the face wash I found it to be on par with other similar products.  It certainly made my face feel fresh and clean, and after a few weeks of use I found it to be equally effective on providing a clear complexion.I'd recommend this product to others, its made by a brand that you can trust, and delivers on its promise to cleans moderately oily skin.", "I have that icky kind of skin that sees a bar of soap and starts breaking out into blisters. A one-time adventure with an exfoliating cleanser (that swore it was for delicate skin!) left me red and sore for over a week. Paradoxically, my skin is also oily and prone to zits once in a while, especially on my chin.Until now, I've had to choose between a cleanser to remove the oil and a cleanser that babied my skin. Happily, I need no longer worry about scouring my face just to remove the oil.Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash, 8 Fluid Ounceremoves every speck of oil without leaving my face look like I used sandpaper. I can clean my face as often as I wish without it getting sore and red. I don't have to explain to people that yes, I'm all right, I haven't been crying (red face), I just gave my face a wash a few hours ago.The generous bottle pumps out foam, not goo, and the container seems to last a long, long time. The foam smooths over your face has leaves a very pleasant scent, which is surprising in gentle facial products. (If you're very sensitive to scents, this might not be the answer for you) Although I love the cleaner, gentle almost always equals unscented, and I don't want to confuse anyone buying this sight unseen. It is a perfect match forCetaphil Dermacontrol Moisturizer SPF 30, 4 Fluid Ounce, a light and fluid moisturizer that gives you the SPFs and keeping your face as soft and comfortable as the cleanser left it.", "Most products I have used that are supposed to clear up your skin tend to smell medicinal and usually leave my skin feeling dry.  This product smells lovely and the gentle foam leaves my face feeling silky and smooth.  Lately I have been having some random breakouts, especially on my cheeks and jawline.  The eruptions were red and angry looking, so much so that I worried I was going to need a trip to the dermatologist to get a prescription to take care of them.  I decided to give this product a go instead and it has saved me a trip and a co-pay.  All I do is run a makeup remover pad over my face to get off the tougher to remove bits (mascara, lip color), then I follow that up with by gently rubbing this product over my entire face and the upper portion of my neck.  Rinse thoroughly with warm water and pat dry.  Afterwards, I apply a small amount of moisturizer.  This is the same routine I was following before, all I did was change the wash from my normal facial cleanser to the Cetaphil.  In just a few days I saw improvement and after a couple of weeks my skin was clearer than it has been for months.", "I chose this product because I use something very similar from a competitor.  Cetaphil derma control has almost the exact ingredients for less than half the price.I do not have acne, but I do have a very oily face, especially in the T-zone.  This product cleaned off all of my makeup easily and left my face feeling supple but not dry.  I have read the other reviews, and I guess if you have a problem with scented products you should not use this, however I do not.  I enjoyed the scent and loved the way my face felt.For the price it is a great product.  If you arent hypo allergetic you will love this product.  Takes your makeup off, cleans your skin and doesnt dry your skin.I love it and will definitely be buying again.Thanks Cetaphil for another great productThanks Vine for allowing me to try this product.", "Having struggled with skin that is both sensitivity and oily, I have found it difficult to find a soap that cleaned effectively without drying out my skin. For that reason, I was happy to discover that Cetaphil had added a foam wash to their product line.  I decided to give it a try.After several days of use, I have been pleased with Cetaphil's Dermacontrol Foam Wash. I use it to wash at the end of the day. Although I understand that others have been bothered by the idea that fragrances are used in the product, my skin has not been irritated at all.  I get a gentle clean which helps control oily build-up overnight which has noticeably improved my skin health.  Cetaphil foam wash has been perfect for removing the daily grime at the end of the day, allowing me to wake up with better skin. And that's a good thing.I highly recommend this excellent product to everyone.", "I have always had a hard time finding a cleaner that will not only clean well but will also not dry out my skin. The Ceraphol Dermacontrol Foam does both! I also enjoy the scent as most washes have a sterile smell this one leaves my skin looking, feeling and smelling clean!", "Growing up, I rarely ever had problems with acne.  However, as an adult I have a little acne problem on my forehead and a little on my nose, along with a very occasional problem elsewhere.  I like to have a matte appearance, so shine control is important to me.I have been using the Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash for a few weeks.  It seemed to clear up most of my forehead, and I haven't had problems anywhere else on my face yet.  I don't know that it controls shine, but I'm happy that it is controlling the acne problem.It also has a light, clean, almost florally smell to it.  It has a very pretty smell, but it's not overwhelming.  It's definitely not masculine!!!I think the only thing I didn't really like about it is that the foam goes away pretty quickly and it's hard to tell if you have actual product on your hands/face or if it's just water.  I know that lather isn't necessary to clean, but it can be a little difficult knowing if you are using enough.  Even with that, I plan to find the matching moisturizer to try and will definitely continue using the Dermacontrol foam wash!!!", "When it has came down to face washes, they honestly are a mixed bag of good at drying or overmoisturizing your face. For Cetaphil, they have had a new breed of cleansers to work with your face. The Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash, promises well, yet it can be very meek when you are washing your face. It has the distinctive of a foamed hand wash, yet you really don't feel the tingle unlike other brands like Clerasil or Olay facial care products. The product isn't really a must buy for you, but can also feel too sensitive to foam up on your face. I would definitely recommend another brand like Clean & Clear or Oxy skin care as a better bet for your blemish problems.Price: C-Comfort & Care: COverall: C 1/2-", "I have normal to dry skin and the product left my face feeling clean and moisturized.  I didn't have that itchy feeling that I normally experience with soap.  I love the smell, it was light; not overpowering like some face wash.  My daughter has oily skin.  She used the product with different results.  She said it felt like it left a film that she couldn't rinse off.", "I've never tried Cetaphil products before, but I was curious to try them because on several tv shows that I have watched, that show some higher end brand products that you can buy in higher end stores, then they show what is considered to be comparable, more affordable, and more easily found, like in a mainstream store, like a drug store, etc.Cetaphil was one of the products that got rave reviews for being gentle, effective.  I don't think the product they showed was this particular product line of DermaControl.So, I went into using this product with an open mind.I prefer products in a foam form over a liquid product.  So, I put a few pumps of this foam into the palm of my hand.The scent isn't bad, but it's not the kind of scent I would choose.  It kind of reminds me of baby powder with something else, some other scent.On the back of the bottle it says massage foam onto damp skin, then rinse.Pretty straight forward directions.I did like that the foam when I washed it off left a little tingling feeling  I wouldn't say it left my skin feeling dry, however it did not leave my skin feeling soft either, or moisturized in any way, tho this is not a moisturizer.It did leave my skin feeling clean.  This product is an oil control product, for acne prone skin.I kind of have odd skin if you can call it that.  Occasionally I do get a blemish somewhere on my face, the skin on my face can be what they call combination skin, where the t zone is oily, and the rest of your face is dry or normal. I tend to get these dry patches on the top of my cheeks.In the Summer my skin is more oily, so I use a product line for that time of year, but in the Winter I use another product line, because then my skin tends to be dry, where it needs more moisture.I would agree that this product is gentle.In summary, I don't think Cetaphil's DermaControl Oil Control Foam Wash left my skin feeling any worse or any better than most other cleansing products that I have tried and used over the years have.Some products work better than others.  That doesn't just apply to the cleansers that you use on your face.I would be willing to try another Cetaphil product, maybe that one or that product line would work better for me than this one does.Maybe it's just the kind of skin I have.  Iam not completely sure of what I expected from this product, but I was interested in trying it.Maybe people who have more of the kind of skin this product was made for might see more dramatic results than I did.", "I really love Cetaphil Demacacontrol Foam Wash. I sometimes have oily skin and I find this products works very well in cleaning and removing the excess oil from my face leaving my face soft and smooth. I have used Cetaphil products in the past and I have always found the products to be very exceptional in quality and price.", "\"I have oily skin that is prone to breakouts, so I am always looking for cleansers that will control the oil and breakouts without being overly drying (and causing more oil to be produced.)  Overall, I felt that this is an OK cleanser.  It did clean my face and left it feeling very soft.  However, I did not notice any difference in clearing up my breakouts, nor did it keep my face from being/feeling oily.  It does seem to be very gentle, and would probably be very good for someone with sensitive skin.When pumping the cleanser, one \"\"pump\"\" did not seem to be enough to clean my face, so I ended up using three pumps.  The cleanser is very light and foamy, there is a light smell, but it was not overpowering, and did not irritate my skin.  Like other reviewers mentioned, the foam did seem to dissipate rather quickly, but I was able to wash my whole face/neck before it was \"\"gone.\"\"While my face did feel clean and soft after washing, it also felt like there was a \"\"film\"\" on my skin, almost like a moisturizer.  I am used to my face feeling dry, if not somewhat \"\"tight\"\" after washing, and this was totally different.  Also, I noticed that by morning (I used this wash at night) my face was oily again.  After using this product daily for two weeks, I never had any irritation or dryness develop.  My breakouts came and went as usual, unaffected by the new cleanser.As for make-up removal, I always use a make-up remover cloth before washing my face to take off the majority of my make-up (long-wear make up is not designed to be removed with cleansers alone) and I use the cleanser afterwards to wash any residue off of my face and neck.  After the first use, I checked my skin, and I was pleased to see that the Cetaphil cleaner removed all of the make-up residue from my skin.  However, in another test, it did not removed all of the make-up when I used the cleanser without the make-up removed towelette.\"", "The front of the bottle states Oil Control Foam Wash. So the first real question I had was if it would deliver on the Oil Control. I'm sure it differs from face to face, but for me it works great. I use it several times a week, just once a day at night. I don't recommend using it more than one time a day, as it does dry out the skin. At first I thought the dryness it made would be a problem, but I just put some lotion on afterward and it was perfect. I'm really liking the oil-free skin it leaves behind.The container is pretty good. My only complaint is that the lid is super smooth, making it hard to get off when my hands are wet. So I leave it unsealed. The pump is curved up, making it easy to push. The pump(top) screws off, so I'll be able to reuse the bottle, which is nice.The directions state only this: Massage foam onto damp skin. Rinse.Like most face-care products, it's lacking in details. How much do they expect me to use? Just a little? Do I need more? How many times a day do they recommend? They're the ones who ran the tests, I wish they'd at least give some general use advice.I use a single pump or half a pump over a lightly rinsed face, rub it in, then rinse again with warm water (no more than once a day).Being foam wash, it's easy to use, really nice to wash with. I've used it for a couple weeks and the liquid level in the bottle isn't much reduced. Foam wash tends to be a bit more expensive, as compared to, say,Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser 16oz (Pack of 2), which I've been using for years. Frankly, I like the Cetaphil Facial Cleanser just as well as the Foam Wash. This Foam Wash, however, realllllly helps with my oily skin.I like the smell, I didn't find the fragrance a problem, it didn't seem too strong for me. I use a fairly scentless face lotion so it's nice to have a bit of color. Er. Scent.The Cetaphil Dermacontrol Foam Wash fulfilled my expectations, and I enjoy using it. Whether or not I continue to use it once this bottle is gone will depend on the observed benefits over time.", "\"I received this product about a month ago, now, and my teen age daughter has been using it on a daily basis. She seems to think it is \"\"OK\"\" but nothing special. I was hoping to write a better review of this product, but she hasn't been forthcoming with many specifics. She says it smells nice and seems to do a fine job washing her face, but she doesn't seem to think it's any better or worse than other facial washes that we have purchased for her. If that is the case, I guess we're better off using a cheaper alternative.\"", "\"I really like the smell. It's very pleasant and it lasts really long. In addition, it's very easy to wash away the foam, so washing hands \"\"costs\"\" me less time. Would recommend this product to friends and family.\"", "This product is one that I have been wanting to try for a while so when it was offered to me through the vine program I thought I'd give it a try. It smells like roses to me which is ok but some people may not like that, I also like that its very gentle and not at all abrasive my skin feels very clean and fresh afterward. I have very sensitive skin and after a week of use I truly do see improvement! I will be buying more of this in the future,  as well as recommending this to my friends with sensitive skin.", "\"I read one review where the person was so upset by the fragrance in this Cetaphil foam wash product. I honestly just thought they were overreacting, so I got this myself. Was honestly surprised how utterly terrible the \"\"masking fragrance\"\" (Cetaphil's description, not mine) turned out to be. It smells like SUPER STRONG FLOWERY BABY POWDER, and it really ruins the wash for me.Also, the foam gets up my nose and ends up in my hair. Foam is not the best medium for washing faces. I much prefer the Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash.I would never recommend this to anyone. The product seems gentle on the skin, but the fragrance is so strong it's almost unbearable to use.Save yourself the agony of using this product and get something else.\"", "\"This foamy face wash was a nice change from my normal St. Ives Apricot Scrub. It was soft and gentle(at first, more on that in a minute). It removed excess oil without leaving me dry after my shower.However, it contained what smelled like lavender. I am highly allergic, and my eyes started watering and burning as I applied the foam. My nostrils stung. I looked on the label to check for these ingredients, and it only stated \"\"masking fragrances\"\". Cetaphil is a company I usually associate with non-comedogenic and sensitive-skin friendly products. Their lotion is very mild, and does not elicit a reaction from my skin.This product was not advertised as being scented. Many people have sensitive skin or sensitivities to scents, like me. My skin isn't even all that sensitive (just my nose), and this was so uncomfortable I vowed then and there not to use it again.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.02928122878074646, 0.031528573483228683, 0.027141807600855827, 0.030938778072595596, 0.03386881202459335, 0.034843165427446365, 0.032671768218278885, 0.03211749345064163, 0.03399797901511192, 0.03208835795521736, 0.030204778537154198, 0.028488509356975555, 0.03394429013133049, 0.03037841059267521, 0.034969910979270935, 0.030039725825190544, 0.030235961079597473, 0.03435492143034935, 0.03215865045785904, 0.032393794506788254, 0.029223568737506866, 0.028183363378047943, 0.03284892812371254, 0.03201298788189888, 0.03375423699617386, 0.0318467915058136, 0.033383965492248535, 0.03176682069897652, 0.03112069144845009, 0.03207986801862717, 0.031684137880802155, 0.01644773967564106]]}
