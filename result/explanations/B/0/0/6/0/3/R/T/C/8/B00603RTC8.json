I cannot say much except to say that it screw in well and protect the camera lens.For a low cost filter set, you cannot go wrong.", "I have used the UV filter and the circular polarizing filter but not the warming filter yet. The polarizing filter works well and does not cause any lag in focus time. Same for the UV filter. I used a lens hood on a 10-24mm Tamaron super-wide angle lens with the filters mentioned and did not notice any glare or lens flare. In a couple instances I was shooting directly at the sun while the sun was blocked behind a plane's propeller. The picture was perfect with no flare. The case the kit comes with hold six filters 77 mm or smaller. This is worth about $20 all by itself.", "Bought these just to protect my lense but for the price why not get the 3 piece kit. The glass is thin but what would you expect for the price. It suits my needs, no regrets", "These are one of the bargains I am happy to find on AmazonI have perhaps 6 complete sets of these for all the lenses andsystem in play.I use them almost daily and find them to be more than better for my purposes.Well made and a free pouch...thats what Im' talking about.Very Happy with purchase", "I am really delighted to see AGFA products showing up every so often.  My friend in Essen, Germany had informed that AGFA had in fact, pulled the plug and closed their doors.  Hopefully this is not true.  I have used AGFA products almost exclusively because they are/were a quality company producing quality products.  I even occasionally find some AFGA film out there and am never disappointed with the results.  I have not been able to find a diffuser, or soft focus filter from them.Anyway, thanks for reading, and again, great quality from AGFA.Tony", "I had just purchased a high dollar camcorder and needed to have some type of protection over the lens. The camcorder has a built in lens cover that contracts when the camcorder is powered up, however I just felt additional protection was needed. The three filters come in a very nice cloth pouch that makes them easy to carry with your photo equipment. I have only used the UV filter and it is working fine with no affects on my photos. The quality seems to be very good. I will be using the other two filters soon and will update my review at that time.", "If their is a difference between these filters and ones costing a lot more, well . . . the difference is lost on me.  These days I days I do everything on the cheap.  So, I ordered these.They arrived in a very nice wallet style container.  Each filter is contained in a metal &#34;O-Ring&#34; and the threads slide smoothly on my expensive Canon lens.Got a tight budget?  You'll probably like this filter kit.  What's to go wrong?", "There are really good filters. I paired them with my Sony a57 (18-135mm) and they are as good as much more expensive filters. I only had one issue and that was with the filters when the lens was at 18mm. You get some clipping at the edges of the frame. However this was also the case with some Hoya filters I tried so I guess it is just something I have to be careful of with the Sony on wide angle. The filters are sturdy and have the look and feel of quality. I can't really same the same of the filter case but it lives in my bag and does hold 6 filters so I am not complaining.", "I am totally pleased with the product! Everything was delivered quickly and the soft cushioned case that the filters come in is terrific, inspiring confidence that I can carry them without fear of scratches or breakage.I recently purchased a new Pentax K-30 DSLR. My primary reason for ordering these filters was twofold:1) protecting my new lenses (and this product does just that) and2) since I do a lot of landscape photography, I am a big fan of polarizing filters, which allow me to really deepen blue skies on sunny days. The polarizing filter that comes with this package works great, allowing me to dial in the amount of dark blue skies for more dramatic lighting. Many thanks!Plus, the price was right. The company shipped promptly. I then purchased another set for another lens that I purchased with a different filter size.", "Had occasion to use them a few times now and I'm quite happy with them.  They are well worth the price.", "These are well made filters I purchase for my Fuji Film XS-1 camera.  The filters came in a very nice cloth pouch that has room for several more filters, a very nice and unexpected touch.  The filters are an excellent fit on the camera.  They are made of metal and glass.  I don't expect any problems using the filters and after taking several comparison shots with the filters on and off the camera, I didn't see any degradation of the images.  The the price was excellent as such this was a great purchase .  I usually use B & W filters but the costs of these filters was not in my budget for this camera.  I don't think you will be disappointed with this product.", "I needed a filter set in 86mm for the Sigma 150-500 mm lens for my Canon camera.  For the value I am *very* pleased with the filter results. Sure at some point when I become more experienced I will probably invest in a much costlier filter set, but for now as I am learning this is the perfect set - and is yielding professional looking results.This package included a UV filter, a circular polarizer filter, a warming (intensifier) filter and a pouch to store my filters. The packaging states they were designed in Germany, made in China, distributed by Zeikos.", "These are great for one lens I have that is 82mm and needs filters now and then. The quality of glass seems good; no sense putting a poor-quality filter in front of a very good quality lens. However, since I don't' use this lens often, I didn't want to spend a lot more. They are adequate to the job. Came with a case. Nice.", "Agfa is a trademark used under license by Zeikos, a marketer of photo accessories. These filters are not made in Germany, but in China using Japanese optics. A few other brands like Bower do the same thing.Every lens should have a UV or Sky filter attached at all times to protect the front element. Own five lenses? You should own five such filters. Enough said.For outdoor photography, polarizing filters darken blue sky while leaving white clouds almost as bright. The effect is amazing. Polarizing filters allow one to vary ocean color among various shades of blue to green. And change the transparency of a stream from opaque to seeing the bed. Circular polarizers (CPLs) work the same as linear polarizers, except the former can be used on auto-focus cameras while the latter may not.I have not used the warming intensifier, but it seems just the ticket for simulating sunset lighting on an indoor shoot. Or really intensifying an actual sunset!One word of warning: no filter in the set is multi-coated. Now since colored filters, including polarizers, reduce light transmission anyways, the benefits of multi-coating are not as intense. But since a UV filter is designed to be as transparent as possible, the benefits of multi-coating are more noticeable.I mention this because you may be able to purchase an Agfa multi-coated UV filter along with some non-multi-coated CPL for about the same price of this kit. Or an Agfa multi-coated UV and multi-coated CPL for a little bit more. All that to say that if the intensifier and filter case are not important to you, perhaps you would get better value buying these filters separately.Four stars for a good value. If the included UV filter was multi-coated, I would have given the kit five stars.", "Ok, it's $14 so I'm not really complaining here. I own several high quality filters for other lenses and was looking to buy a polarized filter for a 72mm lens. I saw these and said, &#34;worth a shot&#34;. At the end of they day, you get what you pay for. This three pack of filters are less expensive than one high quality one but a fraction of the price. Not so much worth it except for the UV filter. If you're just getting into photography and don't want to drop a lot of money on good filters, these will work. If you're looking for a high quality filter than opt for something more expensive and better quality. For $14... I'll keep them and not be disappointed if they scratch or break.", "I needed a UV protection filter for my new lens. I spotted this set of three plus fabric wallet for less than many others charge for a single filter.  They look good, and with Agfa brand I expect them to do the job just fine. The wallet holds up to six filters in separate pockets. Prime shipping got them to me fast and free.", "Very pleased .. in fact was surprised.. when the very nice CASE came along w the  3 filters ( guess I didn't read the description of the item) so I was very HAPPY to get this item..I promptly tried them on my camera .. PERFECT..thanks for a good product", "I only installed the UV filter for lens protection right now I won't use the others till spring, but I am sure they are quality filters the case was a big plus!!!!!(UPDATE now that I have had the chance to use them they are not made very well the rings holding the glass in (Plastic in the Warming Intensifier) were either loose or misaligned I had issues separating them because the Circular Polarizer is out of round, I had to carefully use 2 pair of hemostats with bits of cloth to protect the threads to separate them..)", "I needed something to protect my 300 dollar Panasonic lens, and this inexpensive set fits the bill. The three filters screw onto my lens smoothly and the circular polarizer turns easily for adjustments.  I was hoping for a little more pop when taking pictures of the sky with the polarizer, but it does help with outdoor photos.  The UV filter is great protection and helps when taking pictures through glass.", "I Like having a filter to protect my lense.  Polorizing is the number one filter in my bag. It's very sunny here and the Polorizer adds oomph to thesky.  zultra violet is for protection", "As one who &#34;takes&#34; photos, I need filters. These filters fit/work as-advertised. They arrived on my doorstep in a timely manner -as expected. &#34;Professional&#34; photographers (and I) spend $$$more for &#34;the best&#34; filters with multiple coatings, etc. I'd rather buy a new lens than over-priced filters."], "Gamma": [0.05478283762931824, 0.15753678977489471, 0.15753678977489471, 0.15753678977489471, 0.15753678977489471, 0.157533198595047, 0.15753678977489471], "Beta": [[0.0026102110277861357, 0.0014863500837236643, 0.10299316048622131, 0.0074784778989851475, 0.12916509807109833, 0.01107043121010065, 0.07024720311164856, 0.09610173851251602, 7.964893302414566e-05, 0.10465274751186371, 0.14925184845924377, 6.392510840669274e-05, 0.011269927956163883, 0.0009401720599271357, 0.0011267446679994464, 0.0044183130376040936, 0.12105713039636612, 0.1071447879076004, 0.0003630908322520554, 0.07383207231760025, 0.0046469466760754585], [0.0021827341988682747, 0.0011576542165130377, 0.10549274832010269, 0.005047428887337446, 0.13050460815429688, 0.008937918581068516, 0.07136364281177521, 0.1013057753443718, 6.580674380529672e-05, 0.1086069643497467, 0.14774267375469208, 6.427506741601974e-05, 0.009513868018984795, 0.0014413046883419156, 0.0007883069920353591, 0.002458651550114155, 0.12553127110004425, 0.10976701974868774, 0.000512131373398006, 0.06382926553487778, 0.003685922361910343], [0.0021827341988682747, 0.0011576542165130377, 0.10549274832010269, 0.005047428887337446, 0.13050460815429688, 0.008937918581068516, 0.07136364281177521, 0.1013057753443718, 6.580674380529672e-05, 0.1086069643497467, 0.14774267375469208, 6.427506741601974e-05, 0.009513868018984795, 0.0014413046883419156, 0.0007883069920353591, 0.002458651550114155, 0.12553127110004425, 0.10976701974868774, 0.000512131373398006, 0.06382926553487778, 0.003685922361910343], [0.0021827341988682747, 0.0011576542165130377, 0.10549274832010269, 0.005047428887337446, 0.13050460815429688, 0.008937918581068516, 0.07136364281177521, 0.1013057753443718, 6.580674380529672e-05, 0.1086069643497467, 0.14774267375469208, 6.427506741601974e-05, 0.009513868018984795, 0.0014413046883419156, 0.0007883069920353591, 0.002458651550114155, 0.12553127110004425, 0.10976701974868774, 0.000512131373398006, 0.06382926553487778, 0.003685922361910343], [0.0021827341988682747, 0.0011576542165130377, 0.10549274832010269, 0.005047428887337446, 0.13050460815429688, 0.008937918581068516, 0.07136364281177521, 0.1013057753443718, 6.580674380529672e-05, 0.1086069643497467, 0.14774267375469208, 6.427506741601974e-05, 0.009513868018984795, 0.0014413046883419156, 0.0007883069920353591, 0.002458651550114155, 0.12553127110004425, 0.10976701974868774, 0.000512131373398006, 0.06382926553487778, 0.003685922361910343], [0.0021827565506100655, 0.0011576596880331635, 0.10549277812242508, 0.005047437269240618, 0.1305045187473297, 0.008937940932810307, 0.07136375457048416, 0.1013057753443718, 6.580814078915864e-05, 0.10860694199800491, 0.14774250984191895, 6.427631160477176e-05, 0.009513899683952332, 0.001441332628019154, 0.0007883132202550769, 0.00245866971090436, 0.1255311667919159, 0.10976699739694595, 0.0005121342255733907, 0.06382940709590912, 0.0036859391257166862], [0.0021827341988682747, 0.0011576542165130377, 0.10549274832010269, 0.005047428887337446, 0.13050460815429688, 0.008937918581068516, 0.07136364281177521, 0.1013057753443718, 6.580674380529672e-05, 0.1086069643497467, 0.14774267375469208, 6.427506741601974e-05, 0.009513868018984795, 0.0014413046883419156, 0.0007883069920353591, 0.002458651550114155, 0.12553127110004425, 0.10976701974868774, 0.000512131373398006, 0.06382926553487778, 0.003685922361910343]]}
