"], "reviews": ["Back in 2011 Dr. Oz did some segments about bee venom being used in a variety of beauty products, facial creams and masks being the big sellers.Bee stings causes puffiness and swelling which in turn increases the collagen and reduces the fine lines and wrinkles on your skin. Besides helping fill in lines, bee venom also help maintain skin tone and color. When a bee stings you it is the active component &#34;Melittin&#34; that causes the localized pain and inflammation at the injected part of your body. Melittin can absorb toxins, but it also soaks in oxygen, amino acids and hormones that can give your skin a natural rejuvenation. That is what Beenigma does without the actual bee sting.Upon the first application I did feel a slight tingle, but after continuous use that seems to fade away. The cream is thick and quickly absorbs into your skin. Since it is so dense, it does not glide on smoothly but it disappears quickly.Beenigma can be used as either a cream or a mask. Use as a cream: Wash face and apply morning and night. The nourishing formulation will absorb into the skin. Avoid contact with the eyes. I made the mistake of touching my eyes after applying the cream and I will never do it again!Use as a mask: Up to 3 times a week. Wash face and gently massage, a generous layer to your neck and face. Leave on for at least 20 minutes. Wipe off the extra layer with a towel or facial tissue.Soap is a neutralizer to the bee venom and the two products should not be used together.After 4 weeks of continuous use I have seen a tremendous improvement in my skins overall tone and color. My face glows, it is extremely soft and a majority of the lines lines are faint. It has not really help with my forehead lines which are the biggest wrinkled areas, but my smile, nose and crows feet have improved significantly.Sample provided for review.", "I received this product, several weeks ago, from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.  I used it once or twice a day since then in order to really test it out.First of all the smell of it is divine.  It reminded me of a muted rose - light and fragrant, not overpowering or too floral.  I have never tried any other bee venom products so I have no source of comparison.A little goes a long way.  I simply freckled my face with the moisturizer and rubbed it in.  It feels, at first, that it would be hard to spread because it is thicker than the normal moisturizers I have used.  But it melts like butter on your skin and spreads easily.I can&#8217;t tell any difference in lines or appearance, I can say, honestly, that I have received two compliments on my skin in the past two weeks and that is something I haven&#8217;t heard very often since at the age of 30 my skin decided it wanted to act like it was in middle school!What I like most besides the scent?  The way it instantaneously soaks into your skin without you feeling greasy, heavy or clogged.  It&#8217;s like you never put it on.  The feel of it disappears although you are completely moisturized.  I don&#8217;t wear makeup because I cannot stand the feel of anything on my face.  This moisturizer was perfect in that way.  It just became one with my skin.The price seems crazy high to me as I tend not to spend too much money on myself, but I loved how it made my skin feel, so I can see myself investing in some.  And after using it for almost a month, I still have quite a bit left &#8211; the majority of the jar.  A little really goes go a long way!Cherise Everhard, February 2014", "This review is from: Beenigma Bee Venom Cream (Misc.)My wife has been using this facial cream. We see results and saw them in about 3 days. We don't know how long-lasting this will be. The result is a slight puffing or fullness of the facial skin along with her reported feelings of rejuvenation.This has been a fun experience! Bee venom causes a sensation that's pretty interesting. I couldn't help but research why this makes sense.Bee venom is used in various medicinal products including some that deliver therapy for joint disease. The venom is obtained by delivering a mild electric shock though glass, causing bees to sting the glass and the venom to run off into collection.On contact with the skin, the venom causes local inflammation and also prevents clotting of the blood since it is an anticoagulant. This then stimulates the skin to produce collagen. Collagen is the most abundant protein in our bodies.The other ingredients include Manuka honey, shea butter and vitamin e. Manuka honey is an expensive, dark monofloral honey produced from the nectar of the manuka tree and has a long history of use as a topical healing agent for wounds and burns. Manuka honey is antibacterial. Shea butter is a complex fat from the nuts of the West African Shea and is widely used in skin care products.Based on our experience, this product works at least in the short term. The experience using it is stimulating.I received a sample in the expectation that I would provide an honest review, which I have done.", "At first, my wife was very skeptical of Beenigma and thought that it was another in a long line of creams offering false promises. After three weeks of use my wife has not only been won over, but she is recommending Beenigma to her friends. My wife has never had a significant number of wrinkles her face  but now her skin is noticeably smoother. She really enjoys the natural fragrance (a bit like honey, but not as strong) and the tingling sensation she experiences when it is on her face. The only concern remains for her is the possible long term effect of placing bee venom on your face.Beenigma claims that bee Venom is one of nature's most powerful agents for producing collagen and elastin production. This helps to reduce wrinkles and reverse the signs of aging. While I can't claim that this is all true, but so far the results seem to positive.Notes/Directions- Can be used as a nightly/morning moisturizer or it can be used a face mask (3 nights a week for 20 minutes per usage). My wife uses a very small amount, primarily around her eyes, each night before she goes to bed.- Do not use if you have any bee allergies- Very nice packaging - my wife made it a point to state that it was as nice as high-end cosmetics- My wife has not had any type of skin reaction ...rash or otherwise.- As a nightly moisturizer she preferred Beenigma to her typical regimen of Origins moisturizer... she also thinks that it compares favorably to Lancome (which is at a similar price point)- Very high quality ingredients - nothing about the product from fragrance, packaging, consistency, to results have any signs of being a gimmicky- You definitely will want to take a look at the Beenigma webpage.Final verdict - After three weeks Beenigma turned a couple of skeptics into believers. In truth, when I was offered the product for reviewing purposes we almost didn't accept.... we thought that at best it would be a wast of time.... or at worst we would have a strong reaction with our skin. In the three weeks she has been using the product her opinion has completely reversed and now she is recommending it to her friends and family. Highly Recommended.5 StarsPlease note we were provided a sample for reviewing purposes", "\"I tend to be more than a little skeptical about \"\"amazing\"\" product claims especially those concerning beauty products.  So, when I received a sample of this Bee Venom Cream, I rubbed a little on my face expecting nothing.  I glanced in the mirror as I turned to leave the bathroom and did a double take... this cream actually tightened the fine lines around my eyes!  Instantly.  Noticeably.  I was pretty astounded so I decided to experiment a little with it.  This is what I found out:* This cream works particularly well on \"\"crepe-y\"\" areas - you know, skin that is starting to loosen and is beginning to look a little like crepe paper.  Eyelids are particularly vulnerable to this type of crepe-y skin.  This cream is a miracle on skin like this.* It works well on smaller crow's feet and other fine lines, but it's less effective on deeper wrinkles.* Though it's suggested use is as a mask that you leave on for twenty minutes then remove, I tried leaving it on all day and putting my regular moisturizer on over it and it seemed to work fine.* I have really sensitive skin and I had no problems or reactions from using this product.* The results last most of the day.* It doesn't make your skin feel odd or tight - it feels completely normal, but the skin looks tighter.* It has virtually no scent.* The company's website says that the bees are used in an ethical and responsible way.I was so impressed that I shared this cream with my friend to see if she experienced the same or similar results.  She walked into the bathroom and then, about five minutes later, she howled, \"\"This stuff is [bleeped] amazing!\"\"We are in our late 40's and early 50's, and we both have skin that is relatively youthful and just starting to loosen.  And we both experienced very similar results - the skin around our eyes, including the little crow's feet seemed to tighten instantly and stayed that way for the rest of the day.  I usually skip around to various products, but I will definitely be buying more of this and recommending it to my friends.\"", "I'd never heard of using bee venom in a cosmetic prior to finding out about this product. Although I was skeptical, after using it for a couple of weeks, there have been positive results.Granted, it has not rolled back a couple of decades on my 50+ year old face. But it has visibly improved wrinkles around my eyes and on my neck. They haven't been eradicated, but this has made more of an impact than any other cream I've used.It can be used as a mask or as a daily cream. I've been using it as a daily cream since that's a more practical use for me. It has an interesting, and not unpleasant tingly feel when applied. I did have some irritation on my neck the first couple of days, but it was not excessive and did not continue once my skin became more accustomed to it.My only complaint is the scent - it's a floral scent, which in itself is not an issue, but it is a bit too strong. The scent lingers for a long time. An unscented version, or a version with a more subdued scent that didn't linger would be much more appealing for my needs.But overall, a good product that does produce results.[Sample provided for review]", "\"I found this to be less effective than I expected in some areas of my face and more effective than I had hoped for in other areas.Please be very aware that if you do not know if you are allergic to bee stings, you may want to first try this with someone in the house if not the same room as you. Sometimes products that contain venom can be nearly fatal to those with very sensitive allergies, making ones throat close before you can call for help. Also be aware that allergies can crop up at any time, even if you've been stung before with no reaction whatsoever.I have been using this twice a day for about a week now and being interested in the unusual, I didn't wipe it off after the recommended 20 minutes. I leave it on the whole day, like a moisturizer. I will now be more careful to wipe it off before putting my make-up on in the morning and before bed.I never experienced any redness or swelling, so my fine lines never really looked any plumper or filled in. Well, actually they do look a bit reduced in size. Perhaps with more and proper usage they will diminish even more.That was disappointing, but I think that if I use this product for more than a week I will see some more results. As far as age spots go, since I have been concentrating on specific areas on my face my spots have been over-looked. I will rectify that and add to my review in another two weeks to let you know what I've found out.BUT---what I did find wonderful, is that it DID tighten my skin in one very big problem area. I have a \"\"turkey wattle\"\"...you know, that loose, crepey skin that makes us (men AND women) look like we have a turkey neck. I have been massaging this into my crepey skin for the same amount of time I have been using it on my smile lines and I'll be damned if my skin isn't getting tighter and less apt to jiggle. I am so thrilled about that. It makes the price of this product well worth it, since nothing else I've tried (short of a face lift) has worked on that part of my face. Totally Amazing!I can live with my fine lines but the wattle just creeps me out and the solution come in a little jar.*Sample Provided by Manufacturer*, but I have to tell you, if I keep seeing the results I'm seeing on my neck -I WILL be buying this for myself as soon as I run out. It if a very generous jar for the price and a little goes a long way. I think I'm going to be able to get 2 months out of the one jar.WAY cheaper than a neck-lift!\"", "I really like this face cream - it seems to tighten your skin instantly and feels very silky and luxurious!  I clean my skin fully first and apply before bed.  The cream seems to have no negative effects on my face, but one evening I did spread it on my neck and it felt a bit itchy -- nothing serious, but just try a small area on your neck/face first.  With long term use I can see this product really improving your skin moisture and reducing wrinkles.  Recommended!", "\"I've been lucky enough to inherit my Dad's skin and my Mom's hair, so even though I am well into my 60's I am just starting to get wrinkles and my hair is still the color it was when I was 16.  Still, there are those few tiny crow's feet, a couple of lines across my forehead, and most annoyingly, those inherited lines at the corners of my mouth that give me a \"\"hang dog\"\" look, make me always seem sad.  I don't like those, so I've been paying special attention to them with thisBeenigma Bee Venom Cream Maskfrom New Zealand.The manufacturer sent me a sample to try several weeks ago.  The first time I used it I noticed just the tiniest of tingles but I've never experienced that again.  Rather than use this as a heavy mask, I've been applying it after cleaning my face every morning and night, paying special attention to those wrinkles at the corners of my mouth.  After allowing it to soak in for 20 minutes or so I apply my regular moisturizer over the top. (When you're my age you need all the moisturizing you can get!)  The smell is gentle and not unpleasant and the cream leaves no greasy feel.  After about 3 weeks, I don't really notice any \"\"permanent\"\" improvement of the sort you might expect from Botox, but there is a very obvious difference in those lines I hate so much, particularly for several hours after applying the cream.Grandma's $0.02 - While not quite Botox,Beenigma Bee Venom Cream Maskseems to work quite well.\"", "I am 42 and I have fair skin. I have been outdoors a great deal in my life and I look like it. I was excited to be offer some Beenigma to try since I am always looking for something to make me less hag-like.The Beenigma cream is beautifully packaged. It looks luxurious. The cream smells fabulous. It is a subtle sweet waxy smell that is very pleasant. The cream spreads beautifully and allows a little to go a long way. It leaves a barely tacky finish and is great under makeup. I had no problem with makeup slip while wearing this.The results are the fun part. Beenigma claims to plump up your skin. And it really does. My saggy baggy skin has that fat thick look that I lost years ago. Lines are less noticeable. But this plump skin also looks fresher and brighter. Papery lines are gone. I have used other creams that made lines less noticeable. But this is the first cream that has ever plumped up my skin.", "\"When I asked my 60-year-old wife if she was interested in trying Beenigma, she was skeptical to say the least. Because of hormonal problems when she was much younger, she has a number of facial scars from acne and other skin ailments. She's tried Mederna and countless other facial creams, but they were either too harsh, too drying, or largely ineffective. But after reading about Beenigma on the company's website, she agreed to give it a try.On the first day, she tried rubbing in a little Beenigma on a part of the left side of her face as a test. After four days of this, she said there was a noticeable improvement in her \"\"smile line\"\" and acne scars. Her skin was more supple, the lines were not as deep, and the old acne scars were less pronounced. She also said that her skin pores appeared to be smaller, but without the excessive drying that other products had produced. On the fifth day, she began applying Beenigma on her entire face and her neck. Now, after about ten days of using Beenigma twice a day, she is very pleased with the results. They're noticeable, too - even I can see and feel the smoothing effects on her skin, and the acne scars that she hated are not as prominent.My wife said that the first couple of times, she felt a mild tingling, presumably from the bee venom in Beenigma, but after that, she didn't notice it anymore. She added that a little bit goes a long way, but she informed me that we will be purchasing another jar when this one runs out. That's okay with me. During our thirty years of marriage, I've seen thousands of dollars worth of cosmetics come into our bathroom, and most of them got tossed out eventually to make room for a new crop of creams and lotions that promised to be the Fountain of Youth (they weren't). Beenigma isn't the Fountain of Youth either, but the results have been so promising that my wife is very happy about it, and that makes me very happy.If you're even slightly interested in the product, it's worth a trip to the company's website to learn how the bee venom and Manuka honey are believed to work in the skin. Also, it was fascinating to learn how the venom is extracted from bees without harming them.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.----------------------------------------------------------------------Update (July 30, 2013): After using Beenigma for three weeks, the brown moles and skin tags on my wife's face and neck are much less prominent. I don't know what mechanism is at work here, but apparently the bee venom stimulates growth of new skin cells or something like that. In any case, my wife is extremely pleased with the results.\"", "I received a free sample of Beenigma Bee Venom Cream Mask in exchange for writing an honest review.  I've been delinquent in writing a prompt review because I wanted to give this cream the full benefit of the doubt and give it a full evaluation.  It sounds so cool - containing manuka honey and bee venom, plumping up my skin like I got stung.  Of course, when I first got it, I tried it on myself, but I then passed it on to the women in my family, including my mother-in-law, hoping that someone would find benefit above and beyond the normal drug store facial moisturizers.  Unfortunately, based on our collective experience, I cannot recommend it.On the positive side, the cream comes handsomely packaged in a nice cardboard box, and is presented in a thick glass jar with a metallic lid, similar to high end department store facial moisturizers.  The cream itself smells a bit like manuka honey mixed with cold cream, and the texture seems that way as well.  Nobody who applied it noted feeling any sort of plumping or burning or any other reaction that we expected from the bee venom.  It just felt like thick lotion, and unlike other competing facial cremes, it did not leaving the skin feeling refreshed.  The cream doesn't really go on like a mask - it seems to absorb in fast and leave the skin a bit greasy.  It's not really easy to wash off as the directions state as it is more like lotion than a mask.  After a few days of use, nothing felt different than using much less expensive drug store products.Conclusion?  I thought the smell was kind of neat, but all of the women in my family couldn't stand it.  I decided to repurpose it as hand creme and see how it handled my cuticles, but my Burts Beeswax cuticle balm beat it out for that task as well.  The rest of the jar is going unused.  Unfortunately I cannot recommend this product.", "\"If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes (and felt it, too . . .)This product is beyond absolutely amazing!  It is a 5 star +++ product!  Many products claim fast results, but don't really deliver as we hope.  We are all looking for a skin product that helps with \"\"seasoned\"\" skin (I don't like the word \"\"aging\"\").  And we want to see results fast.  Guess what?  Here is your product!  I have seen noticeable positive results OVERNIGHT!  YES!  You heard me right.  OVERNIGHT!On the evening of November 11, I began using this product.  I used a gentle microdermabrasion cream on my face to clean away any dead skin cells so the cream could penetrate, followed by cleansing with a gentle plant-based cleanser.  Without drying my face, I applied a light coating of Bee Nigma, massaging it into my face and neck. (Don't forget your neck.  It holds your face up.)  I did not remove the product, but kept it on as a face cream.  Within about an hour, I could feel noticeably softer facial skin.  On the morning of November 12, approximately 8 hours later, I rinsed my face with cold water/wash cloth and reapplied Bee Nigma.  About an hour later, I was driving to work and all of a sudden I could feel my face tightening.  My skin was in pretty good shape anyway, but the velvety softness this product added to my skin was incredible.  I have now been using the product for 10 days and I am loving it.Some of the little things I have noticed:-- I keep touching my face because I cannot believe this new-found velvety softness, including the dry spot I always USED TO HAVE on the left side of my forehead. (GONE)-- I noticed how a washcloth GLIDES over my face.-- I noticed how my face retains its moisture now.-- I noticed how much more ALIVE my skin looks now.I use the product as a cream, before bedtime and upon waking.  I leave it on my skin.  If I want to apply another face cream over it, I do so, but you don't need to.Bee Nigma comes in a glass jar, about 2 3/8 inches in diameter and about 2 1/16 inches high.  It is NOT one of those jars with a smaller jar inside like some products do to make you think you are getting more of a product.  There is a very slight smell, but it is a natural smell, NOT fragrance.  It is made in New Zealand, with the active ingredients (in this order) of New Zealand Bee Venom and Manuka Honey.  Some of the other general ingredients include shea butter, honey and almond oil.  You can use it as a face mask, leaving on for at least 20 minutes, or you can use as a face cream and leave it on.Bee Nigma's website explains the use of the bees from New Zealand that are producing the Manuka Honey from the Manuka Plant, which grows in New Zealand (more about Manuka Honey follows).  The bee venom is said to provide proteins, peptides, amino acvids and key enzymes.  The shea butter soothes and replenishes the skin, while the almond oil is fast penetrating, highly moisturizing and nourishing.All honey is not the same.  Some kinds of honey may be 100 times more powerful than others.  Manuka Honey is said to provide numerous health benefits, including benefits to skin care.  It is said to provide vitamins, minerals, amino acids, anti-oxidant/anti-bacterial/anti-inflammatory properties.  Manuka is said to improve skin texture and vitality, while it is hydrating.  Manuka is said to be helpful in fighting zits and acne, provides glucose to white blood cells (our immune system warriors) while it destroys bacteria, helps to heal wounds while improving cellular regeneration, promotes collagen production, helps with burns, arthritis, and eczema.  To be considered potent enough to be therapeutic, Manuka honey needs a minimum rating of 10 UMF (Unique Manuka Factor - standard).  Bee Nigma states their Manuka Honey has a 20+ UMF rating, out of a possible 5 - 25 UMF rating standard developed by honey producers.  BTW--I have a jar of Manuka Honey and it tastes so good, you could easily use it as a spread.Some of you may think this product is a little pricey.  I believe it is worth every penny.  As a bonus, you may find you can save money on some of the other skin products you no longer need.  It also contains NO parabens.  (According to my research, parabens are considered dangerous to our health, even in small amounts, because they accumulate, with cumulative effects.  Many companies use parabens as a preservative, to give the product a longer shelf life.  Parabens are said to be much less expensive.)Bee Nigma comes with 100% guarantee.  If you are not satisfied, the website claims you can return it within 60 days.  It also says it is a CUMULATIVE product, which means the longer you use it, the more benefits you suck up through your skin.  It also claims to be anti-aging, rejuvenitive, and lifts, plumps, and reduces fine lines and wrinkles.Making Bee Nigma does not harm the hard-working little bees that generously provide the primary ingredients of this product.Oh, BTW - I am not a 25 year old with skin that hasn't had time to season.  My skin has been 42 years old for the last 22 years.  I am thrilled with this product and it has far exceeded my expectations!  And, when you see an unexplained bright light coming from across a dimly lit room, it is probably just the glow coming from someone's skin--someone who is using BEE NIGMA!Note that I am not a health care professional.  These are my opinions based on my personal experience and research.  Also note that if you are allergic to bee pollen or bee stings, you probably are unable to use this product and should consult your doctor before considering it.  As a matter of fact, the label says not to use it if you have a known bee allergy.I was so impressed by this product, that I took the extra time to provide you with some research and a lot of information.  If you try it, I believe you will be every bit as impressed as I am.BTW - Although I received this product as a free sample for potential review, I thoroughly intend to purchase it when my sample runs out.Update 1/19/2014-My full-sized jar has just about run out, so, it has lasted me a little over 2 months. I am still LOVING this product and what it continues to do for me :) and I already ordered another jar.\"", "\"I had a hard time coming up with a review title that didn't sound like an infomercial. But really, after using this for just about a month now, I can honestly say that my skin looks amazing. I'll start with the knowledge that my skin is usually pretty good. I don't smoke, I don't spend a ton of time at the beach or in the sun (although I did in my younger years), I don't use foundation or other heavy makeup either. But as I entered into my 49th year, I was gifted with my first brown age spot, right in the middle of my cheek. Every time I looked in the mirror, it stared back and me and said, \"\"Face reality, you are getting older.\"\"But I was not going to give in. I am not a vain person but this age spot was driving me nuts as well as some of the face creases and thin lines. I was offered a chance to test out the Bee Venom Cream Mask to provide an honest review. As a skeptic, I was pretty critical in my expectations, especially for something with a price tag of more than 4 times what I usually spend on face cream.So I followed the instructions. I was wary at first, expecting a red face, some kind of reaction, tingling or something that would bring the reality home that this cream contains bee venom. But all I got was a very short lived slight redness and the amazing results of the product. My dark spot is now very faded -- almost gone. I watched it disappear mostly over the first two weeks of use. It hasn't completely gone away but it is still getting lighter. Any fine lines I had around my eyes are gone and some of my cheek creases are gone or greatly diminished. I also have some deep 'between the eyebrow' creases from squinting (or frowning...) for many, many years. Since these go much deeper than the skin layers they have not gone away but I didn't expect them to.The product has a lovely scent, a creamy honey smell that lingers for a bit but never bothered me. The cream disappears quickly and really seems to hydrate without leaving any greasy feel. What little make-up I wear did not smear or smudge any more because of this cream. After using this for a month, I still have a little more than half the jar left.I have to say that even though this jar was provided for me to test out, I would be happy to purchase new jars to continue the benefits.I went from skeptic to believer in a month.\"", "I'm a busy, middle aged mom whose beauty routine consists of washing my face with a bar of soap when I shower and maybe remembering to put some drug store cream on my face before bed. I am careful about sun exposure and always wear my sunscreen, but age and gravity are starting to show in the wrinkles and eye bags on my face.Did I mention that I don't spend money on myself? I can't see spending money on beauty products when we have so many other expenses and obligations. So I was delighted to receive a sample of Beenigma directly from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review - I would have never bought this for myself, especially when almost every anti-aging product out there is snake oil. The bee venom in Beenigma is supposed to stimulate the skin into producing collagen and elastin - two proteins our young faces produce but our older faces lack. I was skeptical, but willing to give it a try.I started using Beenigma several weeks ago, and as I saw the improvements day by day I started researching, reading reviews and having to admit that this bee venom thing really does work. I am a convert!This cream gives my face a very slight tingle (but no redness) when I apply it, and soaks in quickly without leaving my face feeling greasy at all. It smells like the manuka honey it contains, which is a nice, natural scent and not overpowering at all. I use it twice a day, massaging it sparingly on cheeks, forehead, neck and around my mouth. I use a little more of it around my eyes, where I have the most signs of aging.In two weeks, I've seen my skin texture improve more than with any drug store moisturizer I've used. My neck is less crepey, my face is more plumped and youthful looking, and definitely my eye bags and crows feet are less noticeable. Even my husband says he can tell that my face looks smoother and younger.They say the improvement is cumulative, so I'll continue using this cream and update my review as time goes by. But as of this writing, I am very impressed with Beenigma and all those bees who contributed to it.", "\"So I'm never one to fall for these \"\"beauty in a bottle\"\" gimmicks.  Given that fact, I was very, very skeptical of this product.  But after having tried it, I have to say that I actually like it!Now, has it noticeably reduced my wrinkles?  Probably not. Maybe softened a line here or there?  It's so hard to judge these things.What I can say is that it has made my skin look and feel better.  I have oily skin so after I wash it, I usually use some sort of cream to give moisture back to the parts that aren't oily.  This process, however, always leaves part of my skin looking really dried out.  Since using this product, my skin no longer has that dried out look in some parts.  It has made my skin more supple.  It doesn't feel dry anymore.  I don't know if it's the bee venom or the honey they use in the product.  Whatever it is, it's making my skin look and feel better.Another thing I was wary of is because I have oily skin that is very sensitive, I was worried I'll start breaking out if I use this product. Well, three and a half weeks later and not a single break out!  So obviously, this can be used on all skin types.I had also read the other reviews and was aware that some people thought it had a strong scent.  I buy everything unscented because I just can't stand these funky scents in everything.  I have to say that the scent of this product, which is very slight, doesn't bother me at all.  It smells very slightly like honey.  You can smell it as you're putting it on but the scent vanishes within minutes, so no problems there.Overall, a very good product.  It certainly agrees with my skin and makes it feel and look better which is ultimately all I care about.A sample was sent to me for review.\"", "After so many years of over-priced department store creams that promise it all but deliver little results, I wasn't expecting much from Beenigma.  It does include Manuka honey, and I am aware that that is a great product, but bee venom?  Who knew?So I am delighted to say this is a product that delivers.  I have had an ugly bag under my eye from tearing up repeatedly over the death of a beloved cat.  Nothing worked to reduce it until Beenigma.  Now it is disappearing, and not slowly at all.I've used it less than two weeks and am thrilled with my results.  Flabby neck is going away.  Baggy eye is almost gone.  I couldn't ask for more.  So, I'm delighted to recommend this face cream and plan to buy more when this is gone.How long will my results last?  That has yet to be determined, but, for now, I'll keep on using it twice a day.  I've barely dented the contents of my jar, so I expect the jar to last for a couple of months.Give it a try.  This one works.The manufacturer provided a sample for my review.", "I have frown and forehead lines that are more more substantial than I would like.  I have been applying Beenigma twice a day for about a month.  Over this time frame, I have noticed an impact on the frown lines but not such a noticeable result on the forehead lines.I began using the product in November.  I first applied the product under my chin to test for an allergic reaction. I experienced about day of itching, but I did not have any redness.  The immediate feeling upon the first application was a slight tingling and a tightness.  The itchiness set in after a few hours.  I noticed that the product had a floral scent that seemed to linger for about twenty minutes.  After not noticing any significant reaction, I proceeded to use the product the next day all over my face.  I did not encounter the itchiness or the tingling from the first day.  The sensation of tightness did come back, but it was not uncomfortable.  Throughout the weeks, subsequent applications have led to a feeling of tightness, but this sensation is often brief - maybe ten minutes.In week three, I started to useSt. Ives Blemish & Blackhead Control Apricot Scrub, 6 ozin conjunction with this product and that is when I really started to begin noticing an impact on my skin.  I only use the St. Ives product once a day, but once it was introduced, the frown lines began to diminish more rapidly.As noted, I have used this product for about a month.  At approximately two uses per day, I have used about a third of a jar.  I anticipate that this jar will take me through January.  I do not use a lot of product.  It spreads easily on the face and is absorbed easily as well.  It does not leave an overly shiny or greasy appearance.I think the next step would be abstaining from the product for a period of time to see what impact there is.  I'm curious to know: How quickly it would be before the deepness of my previous lines returns?  Could the product be used once a day to maintain results?  Is there a point when the product would just be a maintenance tool and no more improvement would be seen?All in all, I think that this product has had an impact on my lines.  It was a great day when I woke up and truly noticed some results taking place.  I want to emphasize that it was not an overnight process.  I have been fairly dedicated to applying this cream, and I think it could potentially work for others.I received a jar of Beenigma to test prior to posting this review.", "I was excited and thankful to be asked to review this cream. At my age, I definitely am thankful for any help I can get with my skin. The day I received it,  I put a small amount on my face to test for reactions, unfortunately I was not able to  use it. I did have a reaction, so be sure to test before applying.  Now what to do? i said I would review this product and I was going to.I found a solution.My sister-in-law, who lives with us and is 60 years old, asked if she could try it and that would allow me to see how it worked on someone and be able to review it. I was happy about that. She also tested to make sure she had no reactions before we started, and didn't. So the next day she applied it as directed.I was taking notes. She told me that she did feel a little sting on her face, but nothing unbearable, and her face did get a tad red, but it was not bad enough to stop, so we continued on.. She had some brown marks by her one eye that she was hoping this cream would take care of.By the third day we could see a difference in her skin. The brown marks were lighter, amazing!  I was surprised, and her face had lost that saggy look that all women of this age absolutely hate, but always get. By the end of the week there was a drastic difference in her skin, tone, texture all seemed like a much younger woman. No, not a twenty year old, but her skin looks healthy and vibrant.  Yes, I was jealous. Let me tell you, this cream works, plain and simple. We were very impressed. I did try to take  pictures of the entire process, but she said if I put pictures up she would sue me, hummm, so I decided not to.  I will try and put an update on here  and let you know how her face is doing, but for now I have one happy sister-in-law!  Definitely a product that works.I was given a free bottle of Bee-Venom-Cream-Mask for an honest review.", "This is a luxurious creamy thick face lotion with the most prominent ingredient being New Zealand bee venom and Manuka Honey. Be warned: Do not use if you have bee allergies!Proponents of bee venom say it is like a natural botox. Naysayers say bee venom is just the latest fad. At $130 for 65 grams, you just want to know, Does it work? The great thing is that the company offers 100% money back no questions asked within 60 days. That's fair, you can give it a try and see for yourself.I have been using Bee Nigma for 2 weeks now. Bee Nigma recommends leaving the lotion on for at least 20 minutes. I leave it on overnight and reapply in the morning. It has a wonderful honey rose sort of smell, not over powering.The results? I have premature deep lines around my mouth that I have wished would magically disappear. I think Bee Nigma has helped some. Overall it has helped my skin to remain smooth and supple but hasn't erased wrinkles. I do love the feel and it makes me feel hopeful for longer term change.I'm giving this face cream five stars because I respect a company that is willing to stand behind their product 100% and allow the customer to try it out.", "I'm a middle aged woman with the same complaints most women my age have - thinner, less elastic skin that shows signs of aging. I do not have sensitive skin and I am not allergic to bee stings or honey - both things you should be sure of before using this cream.This cream is expensive and comes packaged appropriately - a lovely box and a beautiful jar. The cream is thick and very slightly waxy, but not unpleasantly so. It smells faintly of orange blossoms to me.I have been using it for about 3 weeks now in the following manner - I exfoliate my face, neck and decolletage with a Buff Puff and then apply a thin coat of Beenigma. I've been doing this twice daily. My skin tingles very slightly and feels wonderful. It doesn't cause any redness and it makes a wonderful base for makeup to be applied over.I've also been applying it on the back of only one hand twice daily so that I could better judge the effectiveness.It's very hard to be objective when looking for signs of improvement twice daily during application, but I feel the thin skin under my eyes and on my neck feels and looks firmer and younger. It also seems to be having a brightening effect on my skin tone - blotches seem to be fading.My daughter, who lives in another city and didn't know I've been using this, commented to me yesterday that I was looking wonderful! When I told her that I have been using this cream, she looked closely and said she definitely thinks there has been an improvement. When I showed her the backs of my hands and asked her to choose which hand looked better, she unhesitatingly chose the hand I've been using the cream on as looking much younger.There is some interesting science behind this cream. Manuka honey has been used for years in the treatment of skin wounds and to enhance the immune system when taken internally. Scientists are now studying it more closely because it seems to be working to treat antibiotic-resistant infections like MRSA because it inhibits the growth of bacteria! It's remarkable stuff. Google it and you'll find a lot of information. The Manuka honey in this cream is 20+.Bee venom is also very interesting. It's also being studied because scientists discovered this year that bee venom actually kills the HIV virus! (Google this, too.) In other words, it's powerful stuff.Since both of these main ingredients fight infection and inflammation - things that accelerate aging when chronically present in the body - it's not surprising to me that it can have a visible impact on aging skin.Beenigma is not a miracle or a fountain of youth, but my skin is noticeably improved since using it and it makes my face feel lovely.I was provided a sample of Beenigma for reviewing purposes, but no promise for a positive review was made or implied.", "\"There has been quite a bit of media hype lately concerning the use of bee venom in facial cremes and masks. Marketed as an \"\"organic face lift\"\" bee venom products claim to smooth facial lines and improve muscle tone by causing the skin to increase it's production of elastin and collagen. In fact, scientific research has found that the active compound in bee venom, melittin, when applied to the skin, can relax the facial muscles and improve circulation....at least temporarily.Beenigma is a thick, white creme that in addition to bee venom, contains manuka honey, almond oil, shea butter, and glycerin among a long list of ingredients. I found the fragrance to be unobjectionable.I use Atralin, a prescription RetinA product at night so my experience with Beenigma was in the morning. After several days of patch testing Beenigma to be sure that I wasn't allergic to it, I applied the creme to my just washed face and neck. The creme is quite thick; rubbing it between my fingers first allowed it to spread more evenly across my face. I didn't experience any stinging, just a slight itching which disappeared after about 10 seconds.The creme was absorbed fairly quickly but left the skin feeling slightly tacky. Makeup or foundation application over Beenigma was less than optimal as the tackiness of the skin caused the makeup to go on unevenly. Using a standard moisturizer over Beenigma prior to applying makeup eliminated this problem. My best experience was using Beenigma as a facial mask, tissuing it off and then applying moisturizer prior to applying my makeup.After using Beenigma, my skin felt tighter and there was a moderate but noticeable reduction of fine lines under my eyes. This effect lasted for several hours, but alas, not all day. I've only been using the product for several weeks, it will be interesting to see if there any long term effects.A sample of this product was supplied in return for an honest review.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.04641040042042732, 0.046509284526109695, 0.03452020138502121, 0.04375375807285309, 0.04852137714624405, 0.050851017236709595, 0.044844258576631546, 0.05034260451793671, 0.04544413834810257, 0.04693335294723511, 0.027365677058696747, 0.04756771773099899, 0.04458068683743477, 0.05080912262201309, 0.040653061121702194, 0.055137719959020615, 0.05464350804686546, 0.03624469414353371, 0.05241849273443222, 0.05128687620162964, 0.042234018445014954, 0.03892803564667702]]}
