I see a lot of reviews getting slammed because they were expecting a single-player or cooperative campaign, and didn't read the fine print. I, on the other hand, knew that going in and I'm saying that what they released isn't nearly enough to warrant a five star review.The game is fantastic, don't get me wrong. Resolution and graphics are solid, gameplay is smooth, frantic and fast paced. In short, it is a wonderful multiplayer experience--but so are plenty of other games. There is a lot you'll be familiar with here if you are a fan of multiplayer games. You have a character--you play and get kills--you get to level up and thus, get new stuff. Nothing new there. Now in this case, you have your mech, and depending on how you use him, he is either a vehicle (If you are inside) or an AI controlled squaddie (If he's following you around.) Is that new? Maybe, I mean who doesn't like having a 20 foot tall mech at his back. But revolutionary, absolutely not. There were articles out there saying this was the \"\"first true next gen title.\"\" I don't see it. It's good. It's solid, and it's a great multiplayer experience, but the lack of a cooperative or single player experience makes me feel like they released half a game. It would certainly be worth $40, but $60 is a little steep.They tried to weave a story into the multiplayer experience, but there's nothing there that is going to leave you feeling overly satisfied, or at least it hasn't with me.This is a great multiplayer game. But a great multiplayer game, by itself, is not worth $60. I knew that going in and I bought it anyway. I make a good living and don't care about spending an extra $60 to play with my friends, but a lot of people don't have that luxury. And if you're like me, you expect more out of \"\"Next Gen\"\" games--not less. And this game just shows the disappointing trend of continuing to cater to the multiplayer crowd and neglect everyone else. Sad, but true.EDIT*** I'm surprised at how few people are willing to throw their money into a game that is so lacking. I wanted to add a little to my review to give it more context. Titanfall is a shooter. Here is how you build a five star shooter, folks. I'll use one of my favorites as an example. Gears of War 3. A fantastic campaign, competitive multiplayer with far more options than Titanfall offers. Still not enough? No problem, then you can play cooperative multiplayer with your friends against bots, for those times when you aren't in the mood for playing with a bunch of bratty twelve year olds. Still not enough? No problem! Hop over and play the fantastic Horde Mode for even more fun. THAT is a fully fledged shooter worth $60. In fact, after having the discussions, I think I will probably end up knocking Titanfall down to two stars. When you have a company try to sell a game like this for the same price as a shooter that offers much, much more, Titanfall really shows its lack of polish. As a gamer and consumer, it should be insulting. As consumers we vote with our dollars. And every copy of this game that sells is a vote that says--We as consumers accept games that lack features. I say think hard before you do that.\"", "\"I've been waiting for this game since Jason West and Vince Zampella left Infinity Ward a few years ago.  For those who don't pay attention to movements within the industry, this pair built the Call of Duty franchise (which has waned in their departure).  They hopped the fence and signed on with EA, and everything they've named since seems like a jab at Activision and the Call of Duty franchise.  \"\"Titanfall.\"\"  \"\"Respawn.\"\"  Like most gamers I had high hopes for this game and my take on it so far has been a mixed bag.  I will break it down into my initial impressions, since it just came out today.The graphics are pretty good, but definitely don't scream \"\"next-gen.\"\"  It's clear this was cross-generation development, and I'm feeling more strongly that we aren't going to get a true 'AAA' title built solely for a next-gen console in 2014.  The graphics are fairly detailed, but on-screen clutter causes things to blend together, namely campers and the background they are hiding in front of.The campaign:  there is one, but it is integrated into online play.  Honestly, it could have been completely omitted and I wouldn't have noticed.  As it is, you have some guy yelling at you to do things that you would be doing anyway in an online shooter...  \"\"Capture this objective so I can see the computer.\"\"  Sure, guy.  Whatever you say.  I have no idea what is happening with the story and couldn't care less.Music:  In the background during the menus.  As I write this I can't remember anything about it, so I guess it does a good job of staying in the background.Gameplay:  Fast and fun.  On day one people are already doing some pretty advanced stuff with the controls.  The game allows you to wall run, double jump, and wall hop.  It seems inspired by \"\"Mirror's Edge\"\" or more directly by parkour.  You can also cloak, which means finding people and effectively fighting them is difficult and quickly turns into a scramble.  I could see people becoming ninjas in a game like this, becoming virtually unstoppable just by how they move.  Once you get into your \"\"Titan,\"\" you slow way down.  It's almost a detriment to use the darn thing.Bots:  Not sure why they are in a next-gen game.  They are distracting when you are trying to fight the actual players on the opposing team.  They get in the way, but I guess it's to make up for the 6-player teams, which is also baffling.  This game doesn't seem to be pushing the hardware and BF4 runs just fine with 64 players.EA being cheap:  I know, I know, EA hasn't put instruction booklets in their games for a couple of years now.  I'm old-school, though, and this game would have benefited from a manual.Overview:  The game reminds me a lot of \"\"Lost Planet\"\" for the 360 and PS3.  Not just the mech bit, though, I feel that the gameplay is going to cater to a very niche crowd and will have a tough time catching on with the mainstream.  Those who get good at this game will get extremely good, which will turn-off/frustrate newcomers.  Those who become really good at it will defend it as the greatest game ever, because Titanfall does give you the pieces necessary to develop skills that other players will struggle to match.  As it stands, at this early state, I would recommend it to core gamers that are willing to invest the time to get good at it.  If you are a casual gamer looking to just check it out, rent first.  You might be disappointed.*EDIT*  Today is day three of Titanfall and I will admit that it has grown on me quite a bit.  The pace of the game makes it a lot of fun and I have gotten decent with the controls fairly quickly.  The game does a great job of keeping you interested in it, there are a ton of challenges and unlocks to keep you playing.  I've also gotten used to fighting in the Titans and have figured out how to use them effectively.  I added a star to my original score primarily for the fun factor.\"", "This game is one of the most fun and awesome FPS games out there, being more fun than Cod and BF4 and being more like a Halo style shooter. I love this game and give it a 10/10! :D", "Played 14 plus hours during the beta and have played about 3 since launch and it is just as awesome as the beta but now a bunch of maps and all titans are unlocked. Multiplayer only game with storytelling elements that make it like a coop online campaign. All the sony fanboys bashing and rating 1 star are pathetic.  They should go to jelly school.", "Titanfall is fun playing for an hour or two and then I get somewhat tired of it.  I guess I was expecting a little more, mostly in the visuals. Alot of gamers say this defines next gen. Don't know why. Is on 360 too, so how is it next gen? I will be very interested to see what this looks like on 360. I honestly see nothing that grabs me and makes me say wow, that looks amazing. It looks like a 360 game. I wish it had the visuals of something like BF4.  I do applaud Retro for introducing a new spin on FPS games.MAybe it was the overkill in all the hype that's left me somewhat disappointed. I do recommend the game for FPS fans. It's a fast and frantic game with a good amount of choices in loadouts for pilots and titans. It has a strong COD feel to it. For me that is a negative, as I have grown tired of the series, but the wall running and titans break that feel a little. XB1 has the better game library compared to the PS4 and this game is much better than Killzone. Brilliant move by MS to secure this as an exclusive for the xb1. Can't help but wonder how this would look on my PS4 though.", "Amazing and fun. Finally something different that is actually good. It actually held my interest unlike the cod games that are the same thing over and over or the battlefield games which makes you run marathons to get shot in the back by a camper. Really not new games but expansions. Mw1 is still the best in my book.Others have covered the specifics. I really wrote the review to keep the sony fanboys from skewing the overall rating.  60 bucks without campaign kinda does suck. It could have been a really good campaign.EDIT: It's just that good and fun.  I had to give it the full 5 stars. It takes everything from shooter games that I like and puts them all together.  Best shooter sine Modern Warfare 1.  Only one of my xbox friends have has the xbox one.  I will buy this game again just to play with my brother and girlfriend on xbox 360.", "First off, I like the game, I really do.  But for a game with no single player, this game should have a lot more multiplayer features.  Not to mention it should have more titans and more customization of said pilot/titan.15 maps is good for a game that has a single player campaign element.  But yesterday I found myself playing the same maps a lot.  We should have gotten 20-25 maps since this is all the game is.  Not a big fan of that aspect.  I know DLC will address a lot of the issues I have, but some should have been addressed prior to launch.You should be able to customize your Titan and Pilot with different skins, colors,  armor, helmets, something......but there really isn't any of these features included in the game.  Again, a multiplayer only game should have a ton of extras like this.  Also more weapons and perks would have helped make the classes more your own.There are not very many game modes.  I like the variety pack option, but it is very limited as to what they offer.Again I like the game a lot, but for $60 bucks I guess I was just expecting more.  I mean really the game is just the beta with more maps.  I was expecting them to be holding something back to reveal to us when the actual game shipped.  Sadly there wasn't much more to it than maps.Also I wanted like 6-8 different types of Titans at least at launch.  3 doesn't really allow for much differentiation between players.", "I'm a huge fan of the XB1, and I'm one of the outnumbered ones who is standing by this system over the PS4. I'm not taking a jab at the Xbox for the sake of trolling by giving this game a low score. I wanted Titanfall to be good, but it didn't have to be for me to enjoy my system. Unfortunately, it turns out that it actually is not very good. When your internet connection and the servers are working properly, it's a decent game, but the online limitation doesn't sit well with me, and the justification for making it online-only is completely bogus. Using the cloud to control AI didn't make the AI any noticeably better, and focusing solely on multiplayer didn't help improve anything about the multiplayer experience compared to the huge variety of excellent FPS games already on the market, many of which have offline play options.Here's the main issue right out of the gate: the multiplayer experience offered by Titanfall has not improved over 2004's Halo 2 and most other top tier FPS games that have come out in the past 10 years. Honestly, hook up Halo 2 to an online LAN server via widely available software, and you can play it online to this day. Hook it up to another Xbox and you can do local matches without an internet connection. Alternatively, you could play single player. Without system link, LAN, or single player, Titanfall gives the player less. It's likely that Titanfall will never function properly without an internet connection, and the day the servers are shut off, the game won't be playable. In 2004, if your internet was terrible or lost service, you had options to play your games offline fully featured in every single game mode. In 2014: no internet, no game. We've seen this before from EA. Sim City was plagued by the same issue, and the justification was similar: they said they needed the online connection to control the citizen AI. That turned out to be a lie. They didn't need that at all. The online-only was done simply to combat piracy. Even so, the pirates cracked the game and were enjoying it offline. It was the paying customers who suffered. Titanfall is no different. You get the same basic game you got back in 2004, which is a good game, but you get no single player, you get no offline options, and you get nothing drastically new.Titanfall features huge robots called titans which you call down to fight alongside you or to pilot manually. Having a titan fight by your side seems cool, but I've seen my titan stand there shooting the ground and other ridiculous things. When all is said and done, titans are nothing more than a glorified vehicle, no better than piloting a vehicle in any other FPS game. They aren't exciting and new. They're vehicles which can follow you around if you want. Imagine if your vehicle in Halo followed you around and shot at people while you weren't riding it: that's basically what it comes down to. It's not innovative enough to simply have titans in the game and just make everything else the same as usual. A deathmatch in Titanfall is still a deathmatch. A capture point game is still a capture point game. I mean, heck, every player gets a titan in every match, usually twice. In other FPS games at least you could fight for control of the various vehicles in a level. In Titanfall the only way to gain any advantage over anyone else is to try to lower the time you are waiting until the titan is ready by playing better than the other people, but getting your titan 15 seconds earlier isn't nearly as useful as simply stealing the level's only vehicle spawn in a different FPS game.On that note, Titanfall really fails to give the skilled players much to set themselves apart in general. Not only do all players get the chance to have a titan on every level regardless of how they play, but there is an auto-aim homing bullet gun which does 1-2 hit kills, and its only drawback is that it takes a slightly longer time to fire it. This means that some guy aiming in your general vicinity might be able to kill you in a couple seconds without any sort of skill. The idea behind this is to level the playing field to make the game less daunting for people who stink at FPS games, but it's really counter to the spirit of playing one of these games. You'r supposed to have to aim and shoot at your opponent. Giving people the option to be lazy may cater to the new players, but it's not making the game a better game.Along the same lines, the game will let people contribute to the team score by killing AI bots who run around the levels, and spawn in large numbers in various sections of the map. You'd think the AI would still be a fair challenge to kill, like fighting grunts and elites in Halo or something, but it's not like that at all. The AI bots are idiots who barely do more than stand there while you kill them. Farming the AI is exactly that: farming. It's not challenging or engaging in any way. Without any effort, I could mow down 5 of them at a time.One neat thing is that Titanfall lets you run at high speeds at all times, and you can run along walls or jump from wall to wall. It's a fun mechanic, and it's simple to do, but it's hardly worth buying the game for. Limitations in mobility in other FPS games don't make those games any less strategic or fun. Sonic the Hedgehog runs faster than Mario and can run upside-down. Is Sonic more fun to play than Mario? It's just a different game with its own rules. There's nothing wrong with Titanfall's mechanics, but it's not worth buying the game for.Along with these thoughts, I'm also rolling my eyes at the slow pace the developers have taken with making the game look next-gen. A bunch of cool effects don't change the fact that the game is launching at 792p, when most people expect next gen to run at 1080p. I can understand that launch titles weren't running at full specs due to time constraints and developers learning to use the new hardware, and the 60 frames per second is nice, but you're looking at a game which is supposed to really sell you on the next gen experience. Lighting effects are nice, but people want 1080p 60 frames per second before they want all the cool effects. It's sad to see the XB1's early system seller failing to at least meet that standard on time for launch.All that being said, Titanfall is a game I could recommend to someone really itching for a online first person shooter, but for anyone else, stay away. If you're a casual gamer looking for a game to play on your new XB1, go for Dead Rising 3 or something with the ability to play by yourself without the internet. In 10 years, when the Titanfall servers are shut down, and you want to revisit your old XB1, you'll be a lot happier if you stick with games that don't require an internet connection. Don't get me wrong, online games have their place, but it takes a lot more to justify them than Titanfall offers.", "This is probably one of the worst games I've ever played for $60. As a standalone multiplayer game, it's worth maybe $15-$20 as an Xbox Arcade digital download. Though, it's not exactly $60 in my case. It was $249 because I bought the collector's edition. Suffice it to say that the CE-included humongous lighted statue and book combination are both far and away more impressive (and well worth the money) than the actual game. Let's begin with what's wrong.RepetitiveOkay, okay. What game isn't repetitive? But, literally level after level after level is the same thing over and over and over. Other than the map changing, you're literally doing the same thing on each new level. There's no questing, no level ups, no strategy, no cover, no secrets, nothing to find.. I mean there is nothing. You're running around on a multiplayer map trying to avoid being constantly shot dead by the IMC (other live players). Titanfall is merely a death match wrapped around a weak semblence of a 'campaign' story.So, the gist is that you either play as the Soldiers (blue) or IMC (red). The sole point is to win the level or be defeated. After one of the two outcomes, you get to the evacuation ship or you don't. You get points for being evacuated or you don't. The only and sole point is to run around killing anything you can find that is not someone on your team... and avoid being killed.HUDThe HUD on this game just plain sucks. Unless you're close enough to actually be killed by another player, you can't tell if the player running around in the field is an enemy or a friendly. By the time you can get close enough to find out, your character is already being shot dead.ControlsThe movement is way way overly sensitive. Even on the least sensitive, you can literally spin in place with barely a tiny press of the stick. It's way way too sensitive even on the least sensitive threshold. So unrealistic.TitansAbout 2 minutes into each level, you can call for a Titan and it will fall from the sky. You can enter it and start your battle with your mech for as long as it survives (which is usually not longer than about 1-2 minutes). You then have to wait for another one to become ready (randomly between 60 seconds and never).By the time you get your titan, all of the other players on the level are now in their titans. So, the playing field is leveled, kind of. Meaning, you can't exactly run around squashing other players by stomping on them. So, the point in being in a titan is really pointless by the time you actually get it.Oh, and the animation to get into the Titan takes AGES to finish. It's like watching paint dry each time you enter a Titan.Yes, the Titan armor is a clever gimmick. When playing the Titan portion of tutorial, I got the impression that you'd actually be able to use all of the clever things included. Like, jumping out of your Titan, opening doors and then calling your Titan through the doorway to get back into it. Nope. No need for that feature. At least, not in the first 5 level ups. I'm guessing if that's to become useful, it must be in a much later level. I have no intention in waiting through this poor excuse for an expensive game to get to a level where I can actually find out. I really don't have that much interest. If this game is actually about Titans, then let us use them more than not. There are far too many multiplayer ground combat simulators already. We don't need another. If you're going to offer us the use of a Titan mech, then offer the use of it to us all of the time.Fun? No wayEvery level starts and ends the same. The only thing different is the map. Everyone gets their titan at the same time. No fun to be had in that. Basically, every level ends up a free for all death match scenario with a really weak story premise behind it just to get the level going.Worse, you can be playing the first level of the so-called 'Campaign' mode, but the game selects people who are level 42 and pairs them with people who are level 2. There's no fun in that either. If you're going to design a game where levels are important, then you should pair up people are within no more than 3-4 levels higher or lower than one another. Sorry, but this is single the biggest fail of Titanfail. When you design a multiplayer based game, you don't pair up players who are orders of magnitudes levels higher. That just doesn't work.Definitely not enough Titan mech time. These things are far too fragile and explode when someone sneezes.OverallThis game offers absolutely no single player campaign play. This is strictly a multiplayer game. Worse, this game is a weak multiplayer game wrapped in a pseudo-campaign mode that offers just enough of a premise to set itself up as a death match multiplayer game. Worse, there's nothing to do other than running around shooting everyone and everything in sight. There's no strategy, no questing, no dossiers, no audio files, no nothing to pick up around the level. Yes, it is eye candy, but that's it. If you really like just doing nothing but mindless death match and leveling up, there's nothing to see here.So far on the Xbone, there has been no bigger fail than Titanfail... unless you count Ryse.", "60 bucks is a lot of money to pay for a multiplayer only game.  Plays well, but I would probably not have purchased if there were any other games out for xbox one at the time.", "I thought this was going to be something extraordinary by all the hype by xbox fanboys so i gave it a shot. It's nowhere near the holy grail game that many fanboys would have you believe. It's just another FPS that is COD with robots and gets dull after an hour or 2, not worth 60 bucks at all.", "Great game. Innovative, fun, original.  Kind of disappointed that &#34;infinity wars&#34; works for EA now.  But still a must have for FPS fans.", "I'm not really a fan of COD and fast paced shooters. Battlefield is my favorite. As of right now I've bought the xbox one for titanfall and the game hasn't let me down. A fast shooter that I enjoy and even though people compare it to COD I don't see it that much. With jet packs and wall running it seems like a completely different game. Really enjoy it. Will always go back to battlefield but this is a great change of pace.", "They really brought out the best of the Xbox One in this online multiplayer game It is so addictive! I highly recommend!", "\"I bought the Xbox One bundle that came with the digital download of Titanfall. I do find the game somewhat enjoyable, but I guess I expected more because of all the hype it was getting. Anyone that says it's just a COD clone with mechs is clueless. There is a lot more to grasp in this game than there is in COD. It takes time to get used to it, and learn the controls. Right now I'm not loving it, but not hating it either. It's definitely not your ordinary first person shooter. I played a few matches randomly during the day, and didn't experience a single issue, so don't listen to the negative reviews talking about how it's \"\"unplayable\"\" or whatever they're saying. I can't say anything bad about the game really. Who knows... Maybe ill start to enjoy it even more once I get more time into it.EDIT: So after a month I started to enjoy it more. Understanding the mini map helped a lot. You need to know the difference between Pilots, Titans, and Minions on your radar. I regenerated once (which is nothing compared to some of the other day 1 adopters)and what I'm liking now is this isn't exactly like prestiging in COD. You get an XP multiplier for each generation which makes you earn XP slightly faster. You also have a list of challenges that need to get done before you can regenerate again. So basically, if you want to keep regenerating you CAN'T keep using your favorite weapons. This was a breath of fresh air for me because I enjoy using ALL of the guns in the game, and I like challenges... It also keeps people from using the best guns ALL the time. This gives Titanfall more replay value for me. I've learned to really enjoy it... So after a month I'm bumping my 3 start review up to a 4 star. If you're an XB1 owner and enjoy multiplayer shooters this is a must buy! You just have to give it a chance!\"", "Let's cut to the straight dope on Titanfall as by now, if you don't already have it, you know what it is. It's for now, the killer app for the Xbox One (and PC) and it's supposed to re-invigorate the stale shooter market, which it does in varying degrees.So rather bore you again with what it is and how it plays, I will just stick to my experience with the game.So, of course you have a tutorial that you have to go through to access the rest of the game and while for some, it may seem like a pain to go through as many of us undoubtedly have played shooters, this one to me was very helpful considering there are small nuances that differentiate this over other shooters.  If done correctly, you can be finished in about 15 to 20 minutes and from there, you can play the campaign.The campaign itself is very forgettable and contrived and to be honest, I really don't remember much of it as I played.  The thing is, the campaign itself makes us the player, more of the background for the main characters and the outcome of your match really doesn't change it one way or the other how you progress in the game. I mean if you lose the campaign, it's not like you have to start all over or suffer some kind of penalty for losing.  I can say this, as a multiplayer campaign, the main thing I was worried about as far as system lag or dropout never affected my gameplay and my online experience was smooth.  If I had any complaints about the campaign mode was how unbalanced the teams were.  Rookies seemingly were always on the Militia side as more experienced players were on the IMT side.  But I really don't think anyone cared.  Not to mention, there wasn't a lot of variety in the matches played during the campaign as you mostly play attrition and 1 or 2 domination matches. But again, I don't think anyone really cared.  Most of us played really just to level up and unlock new items as we played.  The catch is of course once you finish the campaign mode, you get a new titan for your trouble.I would say that this may be one of the draws to the game that in some matches, although teams can be unbalanced, you are only as good as your FPS skills are and even then sometimes t doesn't matter as in this game, death can come from anywhere at anytime.  Furthermore unlike some games like Call of Duty and Battlefield where it may take many, many hours of grinding to level up, I felt that with Titanfall you don't hit that early grind wall.  Also after level 4, you open up challenges and many of these aren't so hard to accomplish and add to your XP as you go.  One of the things I did like with this game is that it borrowed from Battlefield, the idea that your points come from many different sources and not just from how many kills you got. To be honest, in some matches I found myself taking more time to hunt and take down other titans than I did calling my own and man it was a perverse sense of joy me being like a level 6 taking down a level 20 titan!  Of course also, what is a FPS without customization? Once you get enough unlocked you can go crazy with the amount of items that you get.Another point that I did like about the game is that you aren't limited to fighting against players in the matches. In order to make the battlefield feel fully fleshed out and chaotic, there are also AI grunts  added throughout so that way battles aren't just 6 vs 6 humans...it's their AI allies as well.  Some are cannon fodder and some can be just as tough as human players but again, I did like the idea of this addition to the game so that way it didn't feel like you were always fighting against humans.So, do I have any complaints?  Well, of course.  Graphically, it's a mixed bag.  The cut scenes (for the few that there are prior to going into battle) for the forgettable campaign mode are just lousy.  Maybe it's because like every other FPS, you have to give up something in order to have a stable server, but once the battles commence, it becomes a pretty game.  My biggest knock on it however is the lack of multiplayer modes in the game. You only get 5 to choose from:  Attrition (team deathmatch), Hardpoint Domination, Capture the Flag, Pilot Hunter (in which only player kills count), and the round-based Last Titan Standing where you start off in your titan.  Ok so consider us spoiled but when you do look at how many modes there are in other FPS games, it was disappointing to have so few and yet basic options. And while this isn't necessarily a knock on the game, I DO have to say that in some modes, it's best to play as a team especially in domination.  A few times when I played with people I knew, we always stood a better chance of winning matches by coordinating our tactics rather than just run hodge podge all over a map, so on that I could say it's a good game for partying up with friends.So how about Titanfall and sales in the long run?  I do suspect that this will be the game that starts pushing the Xbox One out of stores and really show what it can do.  Microsoft may have knew what it was doing awhile back when they locked the exclusivity rights up early on because if this was a multisystem game, the X-box One would be dead in the water so this is the game that they need to push it out in this crucial first year. As far as longevity of the game itself, I am hoping to see with some of the DLC, maybe we get a few more multiplayer modes and possibly new titans.All in all, it is indeed a fun game. It's a game that many of us have had fun with since probably the MechWarrior days.  While I don't think that it will revolutionize the FPS market, it does add something to it that we haven't seen. The game itself is player friendly, levels up well and of course is very fluid in gameplay. If you have an Xbox One and only casually like playing shooters like myself, this one is worth looking into.", "I loved this game at first. The animations are cool and it's a good twist on the normal first person shooter. But the problem is that it doesn't last that long. You can get to the highest rank in a week if you played a lot. Also there's few weapons that the average person can use effectively. I've only been successful with 3 out of the 10 (just a estimation, never counted). Weapons. The other weapons are too hard to use in the game especially for the size of maps.", "This game suffers from low resolution and low framerate. This is much better on the pc. Get the superios pc version.", "I have to say that, with all of the hype that surrounded Titanfall, I had very high expectations for this title.  I'm a big fan of shooters, particularly sci-fi based shooters, so I was pretty excited to get my hands on this game.  I pre-ordered it weeks in advance without really doing any research on it, so shame on me.  I guess I assumed that since reports had dubbed Titanfall the &#34;XBOX One Savior&#34; due to slumping sales and the PS4's market dominance, that it would be a sure hit.  After a few hours of the game, I can safely say I'm pretty disappointed.First, let me say that this isn't a bad game at all.  Visually, it looks great.  Characters and environments are well done.  The sound, controls and overall gameplay are also first rate.  In all honesty, I only have one gripe...albeit a major one.  The game is devoid of an actual &#34;campaign&#34;.  Sure, the main menu gives you the option of a &#34;campaign&#34;, but it's not in the traditional sense.  The &#34;campaign&#34; is simply a series of multiplayer game sets.  There is no real story or substance.  It's basically just a drop ship dropping you into a multiplayer battle.  Shoot, shoot, shoot, earn a titan (a large robot that you can pilot), blow some things up for a bit, and if you win the battle, shoot down the opposing team's escape ship before it leaves for a bonus.  If you lose, get to the escape ship before you're blown up for a bonus.  That's it.  There is no character development, only character classes from which you can choose at the beginning of each battle.  Heck, there aren't really any characters to be heard of.  The lack of story really makes the game seem shallow and unltimately, boring.  I know there are a lot of multiplayer fans that will love this game and, as I said, it's not as if this game is &#34;bad&#34; per se.  I just prefer my blockbuster games to have an actual true campaign that contains a solid storyline and a bit of depth.So, take this review for what it's worth.  I'm not trying to bash the game as I am simply stating that it's not really my cup of tea.  Multiplayer is a nice option, but I don't want a game that's multiplayer only.  While MP can be fun, it wears thin after a while.Multiplayer - 5/5 starsOverall Game - 3/5 stars", "First I love my X-Box One a lot. I was hoping this will make me happy about x-box one, but come on. making a game with mech people camping non-stop waiting for the mech to respawn and sitting, really. i know 6v6 was little, but you have so many places to hide. Im shooting someone and i turn the corner he still shooting me and i die. I know COD BS online. Great sound effects, im sorry the graphics arent amazing. I love the whole mech and pilot, a dream come true but this could of been amazing. All the maps look the same.what they should of done made 16v16 and only 4 people can use mech and you have to fight for it like in Gears of war. These games they are making way to easy for new people, I know they are trying to get more people to buy but come on, wheres the skill, anyone can sit in one spot and hide in one spot and waiting for mech to spawn, im very sad.I hope to god Gears Of War is amazing and will never go the way like judgement did.", "This game is basically Mech Warrior meet CoD.  The AI bots are horrible and are easy to kill, probably the reason why people that suck at CoD are giving it rave reviews.", "so after playing over the weekend with my friend. I can honestly say. this is a great game. the detail. the music. the controllers are very good. after the employees of Call Of Duty. they can give them the biggest middle finger. this game is way better than Ghosts. Ghosts is seriously the worst game I have ever played. this game is so much fun and so much to do. you can go after Spectres,grunts hack turrets and all kinds of things for points.  the maps are excellent. not too f-ing big! like Ghosts and not too small. I know. this isn't a story about 3 crap bowls and a little hooker in a bears house. but, nonetheless. this game is a lot of fun. the titans is what makes this game even better you get to board a giant tank with legs and shoot at enemies. have the titan follow you or let it guard say a flag for example. man those ex employees of Call Of Duty are probably laughing right now and having so much more fun learning and evolving into a great company making such an awesome game. they probably send them selfies of their paychecks and middle fingers.ALSO, ALL THESE THUMBS DOWN OF MY COMMENT JUST PROVES IT THAT THE COD FANBOYS ARE BUTTHURT AT MY REVIEW! SUCK IT!", "this game is very fun. it the most cinematic game while in combat that iv ever played. the game tends to feel like your watching an action scene from a movie. the game feels very fluid and the titans are not to powerful, there just the right amount balance with titans an pilots. its a shame sony fanyboys are on here giving the game fake reviews but like katt williams said you need haters. the games awesome people.", "Here's a game that prioritizes fun. Whether you're leaping off of walls gunning down enemies or sparring in a Titan, Titanfall has entertainment value at every corner.It's short on content, and completely lacks co-op or campaign. But ultimately, it succeeds where it counts most.", "Amazon same day delivery... good job amazon. Ill keep it brief.... This game changes the game when it comes to FPS. The player mechanics with the double jumps and wall runs is stunning and adds a new mechanic to the FPS world. The sounds in this game are outstanding. The gameplay, especially CTF are top notch. And yes, the Titans are awesome. Pick up a Xbox One headset ($79) and the game jumps to a new level with surround sound. Only negatives are I wish they had the Battlefield Spotting mode (find myself trying to spot enemies all the time), and the load times and lobby wait times are a bit long, hopefully fixed with patch.GET THIS GAME! Its soooo good.", "Anyone giving this game a 1-2 star are people who don't have xbox one and are upset titanfall isn't on playstation.Buy this game,worth every penny,most innovative shooter in a long time", "I had been hearing about this game.  I have three games for the one.  They were all right.  I actually only like one of them.  So, I got Titanfall.  That and the special controller.  Best Buy had it just sitting there.  One left.  Here are my thoughts.Titanfall is the best looking One game I have.  The first one that looks crisp and clean.  The controls work great on the game.  I never have a problem moving around or doing whatever it is that I need to do.Now for the problems.  HahaOk, firstly, can you say chaos?  The game starts, I move around, kill the enemy, move around, level complete.  What the hell?  That is what I thought the first day I played.  As soon as I start getting into the game, it&#8217;s over.  I understand there are things that must be done, but I&#8217;ve not a clue what they are.  The game seems to just sits you in a location and gives you a task.  They do not do a very good job of letting you know why your doing it or, as I said, even what your doing.  I almost feel like I am watching a video of other people playing.  It just never feels like a game.  Perhaps it&#8217;s just me.I guess that is all I will say about the game.  While it looks good, and may be fun, I never actually get the chance to get into it.  I wish I would have rented it first.Oh, one final thing.  Seems like I&#8217;ve played the main part for like a half hour.  When I went to play today, it looks like I am half done the levels.  I am to assume one of, if not both of these things.  You can go back and replay the levels.  Be cool to build up your stats.  For what purpose I&#8217;m not sure.  Two, there will be more once you get through the levels that they show.", "A bit shallow but allot of fun when you get the hang of the mechanics and the flow. Allot better when playing with people you know as nobody seems to be using headsets (allot of games are heading this way). I would definitely recommend", "Titanfall - XBOX ONE: This game is game of the year for me... Great game play, great graphics, 12 player co-op campaign and just all around greatness... My friend and I have been playing Titanfall for hours...This is something I have not done in years since HALO 2... I highly recommend Titanfall to anyone, as this game is ready out of the box for beginners and hardcore gamers.", "Not going to go into a deep review, you can find those elsewhere.  This game is an absolute blast and is super addictive.  Its everything Call of Duty should be.  Campaign is another multiplayer mode, which is actually a lot of fun, but not a stereotypical campaign.", "Just wanted to throw this remark out there mmkay. I'm not an avid shooter by any means but when I play this game I just love the feel, the ebb and flow of combat. I mean I may not get top leader boards regarding K/D but the moments in this game when you get a kill are very rewarding. So if there is anyone out there who may be in the same boat, you should pick this game up.Also...Don't listen to the haters, most people that are hating on this game haven't even played the game and are just miffed that it isn't coming to the PS4.", "I played the beta for Titanfall, and its rare that i actually purchase a game that I buy the game after the beta, because the games usually never live up to my expectations. but titanfall is different its not just any shooter it is the new standard."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0035317528527230024, 0.00941606517881155, 0.04796753078699112, 0.012910665944218636, 0.009429042227566242, 0.04335203394293785, 0.03828611597418785, 0.07293350249528885, 0.001262580044567585, 0.03141241520643234, 0.014281527139246464, 0.05994533374905586, 0.056798696517944336, 0.045038651674985886, 0.00038877504994161427, 0.007330246735364199, 0.05895102769136429, 0.04452822729945183, 0.02825091779232025, 0.006247988902032375, 0.039652276784181595, 0.028179313987493515, 0.03913918510079384, 0.03201606869697571, 0.04247703030705452, 0.04469503089785576, 0.023473301902413368, 0.00658600265160203, 0.06015435606241226, 0.046395380049943924, 0.0004085961845703423, 0.044560372829437256]]}
