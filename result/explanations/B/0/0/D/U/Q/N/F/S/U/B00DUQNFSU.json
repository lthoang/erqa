"], "reviews": ["Don't get me wrong, this product is OK.  The caramel is light on the corn, the corn is crispy, not a lot of the pieces are stuck together (which I personally do not like).  What I was disappointed over was that while I love Werther caramels, this corn seems to lack a bit in flavor.  There is just something missing and I think it is that deep caramel flavor.  The packaging is good with this product as it has a top that snaps back together for freshness (like a Ziplock bag) and therefore the corn does not draw moisture after opening.  I also like it because it had just the popcorn and no nuts (I am not a fan of the nuts).  I think this has a more sweet and slightly salty taste which I usually like, but this product just cannot compare to a local Maryland caramel popcorn (Fisher's Popcorn) sold in Ocean City and in some of the local Baltimore stores.  It's deep molasses flavor on light air popped popcorn really spoils you for other brands.  While I think this product is OK, if I am going to spend the money on a snack, it would be the local favorite instead of this brand.", "What a perfect idea they had, the popular Werther's caramel and Caramel Popcorn - a natural combo.  The 8 oz. bag is a decent size, they say 7 servings, I'd say more like 4, but that's common.  It could be one if you aren't careful!  It's definitely not a health food, lots of sugar and corn syrup, and a full bag is 840 calories (280 from fat).  But then we all know this is an indulgence, right?The quality of the caramel popcorn itself is very good.  No unpopped  kernels, hulls, or other debris in mine.  Just fairly good size popcorn and all that sweet caramel.  It's very sweet, but tastes good.  The Werther's caramel flavor is there.  The bag is resealable and good enough to keep it crisp and fresh between snacks.Oddly, it is not available on Amazon at the moment and there's no price indicated, so I can't really assess the value at this time.  For now, I'm giving this 4 stars.  It's very good quality, tastes good, is well packaged and meets expectations.", "Wether's has a nice light caramel taste (a little more buttery than caramel) and the popcorn has a decent light fluff and crunch to it, not too hard or smooshy. I've hard darker tasting caramel popcorns which I don't like so this was more to my liking. While you can never beat freshly made caramel popcorn in terms of the fluffiness of the popcorn, this is very good for packaged popcorn. I will be buying more of this in the future.", "I love Werther's candies and have a few varieties in my candy jar at all times so when this popped up, I thought, Ok, I'll try it.  As soon as I put the first piece in my mouth, I knew I was hooked.This is sooooo delicious and surprisingly not too sweet.  It takes just like Werthers candies over popcorn.  It's light, fresh and doesn't stick to your teeth.  I had to literally close the bag up and put it away otherwise I would have eaten the whole bag.  FANTASTIC product", "I have to say, I was surprised and delighted by this product!  I love Werther's caramels and so I thought, hey, Werther's caramel corn - that should be good.  Good does not even begin to cover it!!! This stuff is seriously, out of this world delicious!  I only wish there were more stars to award!  You MUST try this if you like caramel corn at all - you will be hooked!!", "Great tasting caramel coating with nice big popcorn kernels.  Very few hulls.  I am sorry it is all gone and hope to find it available in retail stores soon.  Delicious, and will be my new favorite caramel corn if available in my area.", "This is really good stuff.  I like Werther's, but wasn't sure how it would be on popcorn.  Well, I found out.  It's fantastic.  I just couldn't put this stuff down.  Picked it up to snack on while watching a movie and the next thing I knew the bag was empty.  Now I've got to get some more.", "\"I've never been much of a fan of Werther's candies but I love caramel corn so I thought I'd give this a shot. Oh my sweet fancy jaysus this stuff is good.  As soon as it came in the mail, I opened it and thought, \"\"Oh, I'll eat a bit and then save the rest for my husband.\"\" Nope. I couldn't stuff it in my gob fast enough and before I knew it there was nothing but a few big fluffy caramel-covered pieces left. Obviously I couldn't give him just a few bits out of a whole bag so I decided to just finish it off and order another bag. The problem was, it wasn't available for purchase yet. Ooooops! As soon as I can, I'll buy him a  bag and try not to eat the entire thing before he has a chance to have some.This is a review, not a product description. If you want to know what's in it, how many fat grams you'll be consuming, read Amazon's description. If you want to know if you will enjoy the taste, I can tell you that if you like deliciousness, you will like this caramel popcorn. Yes, it's sugary and high in calories. No, it isn't good for you. Eat it anyway.\"", "The cream in this caramel popcorn sets it apart from many others in a good way. Butter, cream and vanilla are the predominate flavors that make for a distinctive and delicious caramel popcorn treat. The popcorn is well coated and remains intact so there are not a lot of small broken pieced in the bag.", "Every once in awhile I get a craving for caramel corn, quite frankly, I may never buy another brand again. This is the best I've ever had. It's so rich without being overly sweet. This bag lasted for two snack times, on the same day, I'm not embarrassed, this stuff rocks!", "They got the crispy texture of the caramel coating just right. The flavor is delicious, too, and the best thing about it is that there's a little bit of salt in the mix, for a pleasant combination of sweetness and just the right amount of saltiness.", "I loved Werther's Original Caramel Popcorn. The caramel flavor was exactly like the unique flavor of Werther's caramel candies. The popcorn was somehow filtered to select only the softest popped corn. The only negative--which is a very, very small negative--was that the flavor was so good, I enjoyed the experience and kept thinking I'd bite into a peanut or other type of nut, reminiscent of Cracker Jacks or Poppycock. But the flavor of the Werther's caramel was superior to either of those products. Highly recommended for those who like caramel flavor.", "This is the best caramel corn in the store, the only caramel corn that beats it is places that make it fresh! It beats out cracker jacks, fiddle faddle and all of those, and one bag will not be enough!  It's the tastiest you can buy off the shelf.", "\"The corn is crunchy, the caramel is typical Werther's: vanilla-y sweet and a bit chewy, and there's loads of it in the bag! What's not to like? It stays \"\"fresh\"\" for several weeks too. Try it, you'll like it.Do wish it had peanuts, though ;-}\"", "This popcorn has a great carmel taste and the pieces of popcorn are perfectly popped.  The carmel has the nice, buttery taste that you expect from Werther's.  The pieces of popcorn were not over the top with coating, like the new Orville Redenbockers Pop Crunch, but it's just nice carmel corn with a good, buttery carmel taste.", "Werther's Original Caramel Popcorn is probably the best store bought caramel corn that I have had. The popcorn was very fresh, and each piece was covered in that yummy caramel. All the ingredients listed on the back of the bag are items you could easily find at the store or in your pantry.I also really liked how this was nothing but popcorn. I'm not a fan of adding nuts into caramel corn so just plain old popcorn was a definite plus for me. The bag is re-sealable, keeping the popcorn fresh the next time you want to eat it. I had a hard time keeping my hand out of the bag, and before I knew it, I was at the bottom of the bag. My family also really enjoyed it.This is definitely something I will pick up again when I see it at the grocery store!", "I brought these to work with me because, if I hadn't, I would have eaten the entire bag in one sitting. They combine the best tastes -- freshly popped popcorn and Werther's caramel. Every single person -- 12 in all -- who tried them found them to be an excellent blend. No complaints at all. There is a bit of an aftertaste, but it's a good aftertaste! I'd like it to stay around forever. I love it so much that I want to marry it.Now the only reason I'm taking off a star is the price. I don't know that I'd ever pay that much for this product. As a Viner, I got it for free, but I think the price is way too high for the amount -- 8 ounces. If the price comes down, I'd snap it up in an instant. For reference, the current price I'm referring to is: $8.32 + $5.58 shipping. I might pay $5.00 with free shipping.", "When it has shown to what Werther's Caramel has made over the years, they definitely have made some excellent candies over the years. I have loved how simple and tasty their candies have could over the years, but when I had heard that they were going to step out and make something ore I was definitely surprised. Werther's Original Caramel Popcorn  in the classic caramel flavor is absolutely delightful. I love how rich and tasty the popcorn really is, delightful the popcorn tastes. It definitely tastes better than Fiddle Faddle, and should give Cracker Jack a real run for its money. It really is a great delight, especially when you are looking for something different from a real candy company. This should be a great treat for anyone that hasn't had a Werther's Original candy before.Price: C+Taste: B+Overall: B 1/2+", "After many years of not having a Werther's Original candy, the place where I work recently got some in to have available at trainings.  I've rediscovered how much I like their butterscotch/caramel flavor, so it was with pleasure that I got the opportunity to try Werther's Original Caramel Popcorn.  While the popcorn doesn't have quite the same flavor intensity as the candy, that's to be expected since there's more popcorn than candy coating.  The candy coating does taste just like a Werther's Original candy, though, so if you love that flavor like I do then I think you'll find this caramel corn quite to your liking.Unfortunately I finished my bag in two sittings since I liked it so much, so I'll try not to buy this too often lest I become huge as a whale.", "If you are a fan of Werther's Original caramel and you like popcorn, then chances are very good that you will enjoy this sweet, crunchy treat.  I really liked that the caramel flavor was subtle, yet completely true to the taste of the Werther's candies.  The popcorn is entirely coated with the caramel and it has a nice crunch when you bite down on it.  This is not over-the-top sweet, but understated yet distinctive.This bag was 8 ounces and the nutrition facts say there are about 7 servings per bag.  That tallies out to approximately 120 calories per one ounce serving.  I think someone would have to have a lot of self control to limit themselves to that single one ounce at a time, but I'm sure it can be done.  I like that the ingredient list contains straightforward, easily understood products:  sugar, popcorn, butter, cream, corn syrup, coconut oil, molasses, sunflower oil, salt, lecithin, vanillin, and baking soda.The bag has a zip type closure which kept the popcorn fresh and it actually worked each time (not necessarily something to be taken for granted with all products).  The quality control system seems to have worked very well because there was not one unpopped kernel in the bag.  However, because this is popcorn there are some popcorn hulls.  There probably isn't any way for those to be avoided altogether.  A real treat which I greatly enjoyed.", "If you are a big fan of Werther's Caramels, as I am, you might love this product.  However, if you are a caramel corn aficionado (as I am), you might find it too sweet.  It literally tastes like they melted Werther's caramels and poured it all over a bunch of popcorn.  It is definitely the sweetest caramel corn I have ever tasted.I feel like I have a pretty good tolerance for sweetness - when other people say a birthday cake frosting is too sweet, I might feel like I could eat a lot of it.  Maybe it's just that I feel less is more where caramel corn is concerned - the kind I like best is kissed not coated with caramel.  I'm sorry but I just can't recommend this product.", "This was a pretty good snack. It tasted fresh and flavorful. But purely on a subjective basis we prefer Crunch and Munch brand. However it is a good second choice.", "If you like Werther's you are going to like this popcorn.  It came fresh and tasted like caramel candy popcorn.  It didn't last long.  It does get stuck in your teeth, that is the only reason, I didn't give it 5 stars.", "Crisp popcorn, delicious caramel coating, smooth, rich buttery flavor; I cannot imagine how caramel popcorn could be made any better. Warning: serious self control required with this product.", "I have eaten many different types and brands of flavored popcorn - this is by far the best tasting.  The 8 oz. package is enough for two people to pig out on - and yes it will be 420 calories each, but worth every one of them."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.039011429995298386, 0.048641376197338104, 0.037304412573575974, 0.03767027705907822, 0.04224936664104462, 0.039759233593940735, 0.04248032718896866, 0.03947356343269348, 0.038095198571681976, 0.04025435447692871, 0.04158968850970268, 0.035021938383579254, 0.04154478386044502, 0.03609785810112953, 0.04205410182476044, 0.04062375798821449, 0.04006059095263481, 0.03949187323451042, 0.04120148718357086, 0.03404506668448448, 0.04174935072660446, 0.039692774415016174, 0.04009132832288742, 0.042190853506326675, 0.039605047553777695]]}
