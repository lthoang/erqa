It has gone through some sort of special process however, that is vaguely explained on the box as pressing the tea leaves.I can't tell any difference in my energy level after drinking this than any other tea.  The tea bags are double bags with a fold in the center, and it appears that they contain a bit more tea than usual.  Also the tea bags are well wrapped in two separate foil covered containers once you open the box, which keeps them much fresher than the usual package of tea.I did notice that the tea seaps much more quickly and turns the hot water a dark tea color much more rapidly than usual black tea.  So perhaps this tea is somehow concentrated.  At any rate, it tastes good like Lipton tea always does.  I like it.", "I find the marketing of this tea as &#34;Natural Energy&#34; to be amusing since tea naturally contains caffeine. To borrow an ancient expression, it is all a little bit &#34;No duh&#34; for me. That said, I prefer black teas, so I found the taste of this to be nice but short of the pleasant taste a good &#34;Earl Grey&#34; provides.If this wasn't such an obvious thing...I might would round up to four stars but just can't bring myself to thumbs up some extra caffeine that much.", "There is nothing really special about this tea.  It's black tea from Lipton.  But what I do like about it the caffeine.  It's good for those time you want a hot beverage with a jolt, but you don't want to do the milk/cream and sugar thing.I liked it better brewed then iced... a little bit of honey and Truvia.I would buy this in the future.", "I really love this tea.  I received it as a freebie sample with another order.  I wish amazon would make it available, not just as an &#34;add-on.&#34;  It's not available in my local supermarket, but the Lipton website said a Target store near me sells it, so I'll check there.This is a very tasty tea with more caffeine than regular black tea.  It's all natural, done through a special process; no artificial caffeine is added.I highly recommend this tea if you want good tasting black tea, along with that extra boost of energy.  I hope it becomes more popular.  One thing that Lipton needs to do is improve its labelling and state plainly that this tea provides more caffeine than regular tea.  Just stating &#34;natural energy&#34; does not tell us much.  Great product!", "The energy from this comes from increased caffeine.  That's easy enough to come by, but why not market it.  I used to drink Jolt Cola back in the day for the same reason &#34;all of the sugar, twice the caffeine&#34;This tea tastes good.  It is a Lipton quality product, as expected.  You get a little extra caffeine and that's about the only difference from their regular black tea.  Great, if that's what you're into.", "Strong, yet mild flavor, that provides an extra boost of caffeine.  This tea has a stronger caffeine content then the regular Lipton black tea.  It doesn't leave my jumpy, it just wakes me up, which I like.  I don't drink energy drinks because of the fact that I feel jittery and I hate that.  However, I like tea because of the milder caffeine content.  This tea, since it has a higher caffeine content, is perfect for the afternoon.", "\"I've been trying to find something besides energy drinks (yuck) to give myself energy on those days where I have an insane schedule that only allows me about four hours of sleep. This seemed like it'd be a natural fit, since I absolutely hate the taste of energy drinks.I guess what you're probably really wondering is \"\"does it give you energy\"\"? In short, it does. However the problem is that I don't see a huge amount of energy in comparison to your average black tea. It's nice tasting, which gives it a huge leg up above the average energy shot or drink, which usually tastes like liquid awful to me. This might be a deal breaker to some people that don't mind the taste of an energy drink, as they want a bit more caffeine in their drink.In the end this is more for those who want something to drink that doesn't overload their system like a 5 Hour Energy or Monster beverage does. I'd rate this slightly higher except that the package promises a little more than what the average consumer would expect it to do: when you use the term \"\"energy\"\" in relation to beverages, most expect something along the lines of a Monster energy drink, and as such, would be disappointed by this. It's far better for them than any energy drink, but you will still get that small part of disappointment when this doesn't deliver as much caffeine as you'd like.\"", "This is a stronger than normal black tea - it has more caffeine. That's ok by me because its all natural to the tea leaves, not added to them. It smells great and tastes great, and it's got that bold kick.", "Nice strong black tea. I make it with about 6 oz of water (or use 2 bags in a mug). Good flavor, not bitter, a nice no-nonsense afternoon pick-me-up. I like that it has 2 sealed sleeves of tea so you don't have to fret too much about how fast you drink it.The flip-top box contains two sealed trays of nice looking tea bags, so you don't have all the extra wrappers of regular Lipton tea, so the presentation is a lot nicer. The tea seems to taste better, too, but it's probably the same stuff and I'm responding to the nicer packaging. :)", "Lipton Natural Energy Premium Black Tea tastes just about the same as regular black tea with only a small hint of difference. This box has 40 standard tea bags and they are wrapped in two separate gold foil packages within the packaging. I haven't had any problems with broken bags or loose tea but the little paper at the end of the string on the tea bag rips off very easily sometimes. I have had several of them rip off and then the string end up going into your cup and you have to go fishing for it. Each 8 ounce serving of tea contains 75 mg of caffeine and 20 mg of theanine. I usually stick mostly to coffee because I need my fix of caffeine throughout the day. I get the same boost of energy after having several cups of tea so this is a nice change every once in a while still getting my caffeine fix.", "Energy drinks are all the rage with some having added energy enhancing vitamins but many just having added caffeine as the energy stimulant. Caffeine is a natural energy enhancer with coffee and tea being the source of caffeine for most of us.Lipton has come out with a tea that has even more caffeine than a regular cup of tea. 8-oz of Lipton's Natural Energy Black Tea has 75mg of caffeine and 20mg of theanine.In the chart below, the caffeine content for coffee is based on only 5-oz of coffee with Lipton's being a full 8-oz.Caffeine amounts in tea and coffee:Coffee (5 oz. cup) 80Black Tea (one tea bag) 40Oolong Tea (one tea bag) 30Green Tea (one tea bag) 20White Tea (one tea bag) 15Decaf Tea (one tea bag) 2It brews and tastes like any regular black tea. I think it is a good alternative to those who prefer tea over coffee and still want that jolt of caffeine in the morning.", "This is a nice flavorful black tea. It does not contain a lot more caffeine than usual.  This tea only provides 75 mg, where as an 8 oz cup of coffee provides 95 mg (according to USDA). But if you are caffeine sensitive, you might feel the effects more.It did not provide with an extra boost as I love coffee and drink so much throughout the day.  However, it was a good tasting tea and if you are looking for black tea with a bit more caffeine, this is a good choice.  They come in sealed individual packets so they stay  nice and fresh. I would give this a try.", "\"\"\"Lipton Natural Energy\"\" is a black tea marketed as a tea to \"\"help you stay alert and energized\"\". Each 8 ounce serving contains 75mg of caffeine and 20mg of theanine. Compared to regular Lipton Black Tea which contains 55mg of caffeine and 20mg of theanine, you're paying 3 times as much for an extra 20mg of caffeine and the same amount of theanine. For reference, a typical cup of coffee contains 95mg of caffeine. I'm not a tea connoisseur, but to me it tastes almost identical to regular Lipton tea too, which isn't a bad thing. But when \"\"Lipton Natural Energy\"\" costs about 11 cents per tea bag compared to regular Lipton Tea which costs less than 4 cents per tea bag, I see no reason spending so much more to get an extra 20mg of caffeine.\"", "Yes this tea does contain 25 more MG's of caffeine than the Lipton black Tea for a total of 75 mg's. However, it also, oddly enough,  contains 20 mg's of Theanine per 8 oz. cup. Theanine is used to treat hypertension, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease.  I find this an odd choice of chemicals natural or not, to combine into a tea that is supposed to give you a bit of a rush of energy and alertness.I found no real benefit to this tea.  I was not extra perky, clear-headed or even wide awake in the morning after drinking this.My heart specialist did ask me  that I keep it to just one cup a day whereas with regular tea and coffee with caffeine I may have 2 cups.", "This stuff is great! I only like dark roast coffee most of the time and I've yet to find a tea of equal comparison, maybe one that will hold up to a little milk and sugar just like the cofee and this one doesn't disappoint. These come in two gold foil bags and are not individually wrapped, 20 to a pack. I normally brew 2/3 regular lipton bags per mug of tea (when I'm out of tea k-cups) and I can settle for just one of these. It has more caffeine than the regular variety so keep that in mind if you have hypertension or shouldn't have alot of caffeine. This tea will hold up to anything you want to add and is also slightly acidic, which I like as well!", "Rather obviously the &#34;natural&#34; energy of this tea comes from its higher than average percentage of caffeine.  That said this is a very basic decent tasting tea that offers nothing particularly new or special from the usually reliable Lipton brand.  I have come to prefer decaffeinated herbal teas lately but this tea would be good for those who need a dose of caffeine to perk them up from time to time.", "I love this tea from Lipton, I like having a nice hot mug of it with breakfast before heading out to work at 5:30 AM.Has lots of natural caffeine to get my day going!Recommended!", "\"At work, I usually take long walks during lunchtime in order to lose weight.  The temperatures are definitely dropping.  In the afternoons, I'm becoming more sluggish.  Instead of drinking coffee, I've been drinking caffeinated tea.  A serving of Lipton Natural Energy Tea has enough caffeine (75 mg) to give me that boost of energy that I need during the afternoon.  It also has 200 mg of theanine, which is found in the Camellia sinensis plant; it is a natural relaxant that doesn't make you groggy or drowsy.Also, this tea is very dark in color and rich in taste.  I prepared it using my Keurig Mini B30 Gourmet Single Cup Brewing System (Keurig B30 Mini Personal Single-Serve Brewing System, Red), which I have owned for over four years.  Then I added my own honey and Stevia (Sugar Foods Stevia In The Raw Sweetner, 1 Gram -- 1000 per case.).  Stevia is a natural sweetener made from a plant grown in Paraguay.  Stevia has zero calories and a glycemic index of zero; it is perfect for diabetics.  The honey and Stevia enhance and enrich the tea flavor.For those of us who can no longer afford the skyrocketing prices of coffee, there is premium black tea.

Hoyos\"", "I am not a huge tea drinker, in fact I&#34;m getting into tea drinking. I drink standard black tea from lipton and I am getting used to that taste. This tea however for some reason I can't tolerate, I really don't like the taste of it and left my throat dry to the point I had to get something else to drink.For me, this is a pass. I'll stick to the other standard black tea that I have been drinking.", "What is that saying? If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck...? This is just regular tea. It looks like it, smells like it, tastes like it. I even opened up one of the individual bags and it was just fine, nearly powdered pieces of tea leaves, just like you would expect from a non-premium bagged tea. I guess you can't blame the marketing team behind Lipton bagged tea for trying to do SOMETHING to revitalize their brand, but this seems a little over the top.It does look like this has a little more caffeine than regular old Lipton tea. It also has a different ingredient list. The list on this one is &#34;Black Tea&#34; while the list on the regular, less expensive, Lipton tea is &#34;Orange Pekoe and Pekoe Cut Black Tea&#34;. I think the regular one actually sounds a bit fancier.Personally, I would just get the regular Lipton and drink a little more of it or throw in an extra bag of it per pot of tea, if I really needed that extra bit of caffeine (or have a cup of coffee.", "I enjoy this black tea with added caffeine in the afternoon at work to give me a little pick-me up. Although I am not sure it is a true energy drink as all black teas has some caffeine, compared to regular Lipton black tea it is not that bitter when you steep it for a long time. I like it with a little bit of sugar or coffee creamer when a cup of joe is not what I am craving.", "Tea has a slightly acrid aroma and burnt flavor due to the higher caffeine content.  The caffeine gives you a boost but the taste doesn't stand out at all; it's pretty bland, almost generic.  You'll be adding lots of cream and sugar to this one to help it out.", "This tea has a great flavor! I did not notice any energy boost per-se but it has a great aroma and flavor.

I thought the flavor was comparable to regular Lipton tea, and I appreciate that extra caffiene is available as an option.I probably won't buy more -- if I want more caffiene, I'll just drink more tea -- but if the extra caffiene sounds good to you, then I think you'll like it.", "\"From the packaging, it was not obvious to me quite what this \"\"natural energy\"\" tea is.  It is just a plain, black tea packed in little flow-through teabags, just like the regular stuff.  The package claims they \"\"crafted an innovative process where we press fresh, high-quality tea leaves to release their natural essence.\"\"  What exactly does that mean?So what does this tea do?  It makes a pleasant tasting tea that has 75 mg of caffeine per mug.  Regular Lipton has about 55 mg per mug, according to their website.  Of course, that can vary and depends on several factors, not the least of which is brewing time.  The natural energy one instructs to brew 5 minutes, where my regular Lipton teabags instruct 2 - 5 minutes.  Of course, the longer steeping time is going to cause more caffeine to be released.I do like that this product doesn't have any extra ingredients.  It is just plain black tea, and it does have a very nice taste, typical mainstream black tea.I don't like the packaging.  The 40-teabag package contains two foil-wrapped paper trays, each with unwrapped teabags in the tray.  The teabags don't have any individual wrapping on them, so not good to stick in a purse or pocket and take with you unless you provide extra wrapping.  I prefer the individually wrapped bags.At the time I requested this product, it was sold by Marketplace vendors on Amazon, not by Amazon itself, and all buying options were much more expensive than regular Lipton.For an extra 20 mg of caffeine, I just don't see that this product is worth the extra cost.

But also no side effects, I guess.", "I drink Lipton Tea on a regular basis in its many forms and flavors.  When I saw this box called Natural Energy, I thought it might be some great new creation.  I shouldn't have gotten so excited, though, for Natural Energy is really just a no-frills black tea.  The tea has a fairly strong (for tea) boost of caffeine at 75 mg for an eight ounce serving and a hit of theanine.  It's like they want to position this as a coffee alternative but for tea drinkers.  Even the packaging suggests that if you like your coffee with milk and sugar, you should try this tea that way too.I do like that the box of 40 tea bags has two individually wrapped sleeves to help maintain freshness.  The tea itself brews strong and is exactly what you might expect from a black tea.  I alternately use cream and lemon in my black teas and this was fine with either.  I can't say that I think Natural Energy provides any kind of a revelatory experience.  It is simply a solid basic black tea, meant to be taken a little stronger than some other comparable choices.  I'd drink it without question, but wouldn't necessarily seek it out.

Normally we are Tetley fans, but we'd switch if this was available in family size bags.  Luckily, the bags are NOT individually wrapped, so it's not a problem using 10 at once.It has a good bit more kick to it than regular tea, and we have made it a point not to drink it before bedtime - it will give you a solid dose of caffeine.

The caffeine level is also 50% higher than regular black tea at 75 mg per 8 oz. cup cup and the theanine level is higher, too, at 20 mg.It has a pleasant if intense black tea flavor, though it seems the tannic acid levels are higher as well, so it cries out for milk to be added.This is a nice way to start out the morning when a little extra boost of natural caffeine is desired.
