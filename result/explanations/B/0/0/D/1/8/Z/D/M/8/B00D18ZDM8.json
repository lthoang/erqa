"], "reviews": ["I really didn't see much of a difference between this product and other shavers that I have used.  I probably would only specifically look for this shaver if I had a coupon for it and it was on sail. This is not a product that I simply must have compared to others.", "I got these through the Vines program and was happy to give them a try.  They're not bad, but nothing special.  They weren't terribly sharp, so the shave wasn't quite as close as I prefer and it left my legs slightly irritated.  The &#34;trim&#34; was ok but not great - just didn't seem to be sharp enough to be worthwhile.  I'll use them because they were free, but won't buy again.", "This is a pretty solid disposable razor on its own. Easy grip, blades slide smoothly, adding the trimmer onto it goes well. Makes hair about a1/4 of an inch long: either making it easier to shave from there or just to have short.The trimmer just slides on and off for easy cleaning as well as easy access to using just the plain razor.You only get one trimmer for the three razors in the pack, but it works because you can use the regular blade for maintenance and won't need to use the trimmer as much.", "The Bic Soleil Shave and Trim Shaver is an all-in-one easy shaver to use. The attachments slide over each other so you do not have to remove the other blade head before using the trimmer. However, I still fear for my fingers because water, shaving lotion and the shower and I can never cooperate. And I know I am not the only one. So while this shaver eliminates my usual two chances of slicing my fingers by allowing for the trimmer attachment to slide right over the shaver blades, the danger remains in doing just that -- sliding the trimer attachment over the actual blades you use to shave.Also, it is a little harder to clean out quickly if you wait to shave and the hairs are longer than usual.Overall though I am pleased and find this shaver excellent for shaving, leaving no skin burn, stubble bumps and my sensitive skin has not reacted to anything on it. That's a huge plus for me too.", "The razors themselves are fine though, my preference is non-pivot head. This is over-priced for the fact that it comes with just three razors and one bikini trimmer that slides over each razor head. The included trimmer isn't that great, not worth the price. If you like Soleil, you should just buy the usual package. If you buy this, I suppose you could use the plastic trimmer on other Soleil razors. I don't have any others to try this. Good concept, not great execution.", "In my opinion, the Bic Soleil Shave & Trim Shaver is a step backwards in the world of shavers.  It has a smallish head and is stiff & abrasive.  It also nicked my knee area.  It has the feel of a disposable razor.In comparison the Venus brand of razors has a better feel/grip, has a larger head, and doesn't produce nicks.  This is the razor that I have been using for over a year.  The Bic Soleil did not make me want to change brands.", "So maybe I'm a bit challanged but while the razor works great, I just haven't had an consistent results with the trimmer. It works sometimes and not others. I've never used a trimmer before so maybe I'm just not doing it right but I tried to follow the instructions that came with it and am just not having much luck.", "This is a nice, multi-blade shaver with a moisturizing strip; and the tilting head moves over the curves of the leg and underarm easily.  The added trimmer is a plastic length guard that I found to be of little value; but depending on the type of trimming desired, it might serve a purpose.  It seemed that the trimmer left the  hair too long for a bikini trim; but not completely shaved.  I would certainly use the razors again, but probably not the trimmer guard.", "Found this shaver really shaves much closer than others I have tried. Best of all, I found it to  be non irratitating. This shaver is a great find and one that I plan to keep on using in the future as it works so well.Highly recommend this shaver.", "Overall, this is not the absolute best razor that I used but it's not the worst either. It's pretty easy to use, I haven't had any problems getting the attachment on and off the razor so far. I have gotten a pretty smooth shave while using both features of the razor. Although, I have experienced some itchiness. But my skin is pretty sensitive, so I was expecting that to happen.  But I didn't get any nicks using the razor, so that's a good thing.Although I'm not absolutely crazy about this razor, I am pleased with it and I don't have any major gripes about it.", "The first razor out of the package felt as though it was dull from the very first swipe. These are intended to trim the lady bits -- the package comes with three razors and a separate trimmer attachment -- but I used it on my legs first, because nothing goes near the bits until I test it out first. I'm glad I did, because the conditioning strip did nothing, just felt like a piece of dry cardboard, and the razors were dull. It was irritating and uncomfortable right out of the package.That said, the second and third razors were better, so I'm thinking there's a quality control issue here. It only lasted one shave on the legs, though, when most razors last two, sometimes three on the higher-quality disposables.Then came time to try the trimmer attachment. It's a kind of comb with a razor underneath meant to trim (let's be honest) the bush. It looks very similar in shape to the attachment on the electric razor I usually use. One swipe of this Bic attachment and it was clogged. Cleaned it off, did a second swipe, and it was dull enough I didn't want to use it anymore, so I used a third swipe to &#34;even things out&#34; and moved on with my life. I'd say that this said more about the hair on my bod than the razors, but other brands have worked just fine, and I see other reviewers had similar issues, so I'm thinking the razor is the issue in this particular situation. I really cannot recommend these razors at all.", "\"This package contains three triple-blade razors plus one trimmer-cap -- essentially a tiny comb that snaps onto the head of the razor and lifts hair so that the razor can cut it.The razor itself works very well, shaves closely and without razor burn or bumps later. While I always nick myself during the first use of any disposable razor, I did not with this one -- maybe it's the blades or the angle of the head or how the handle is shaped to be held -- and that was great.As for trimming, I've been using a Schick Quattro TrimStyle, which has a razor at one end and a battery-powered trimmer at the other, and it trims very well. But I wouldn't mind doing without a battery gadget so I was interested in this Bic. Unfortunately, the Bic functioned more as a \"\"thinner\"\" than a trimmer -- after going over the area numerous times at different angles, the hair was definitely sparser but what remained was as long as before using the trimmer, and there was no way to customize the length to individual preference. I'll stay with the Schick for trimming.\"", "With bikini season right around the corner, I was thrilled to review this product.  I typically use Nair or get waxed in the bikini area so as to avoid the dreaded red bumps in that area.  This is one product I will definitely use in between the above mentioned and I can already see that the red bumps are in the past for me IF i use this Bic Soleil Shave And Trim Shaver.  It's easy to use by simply sliding the &#34;trimmer&#34; attachment on.  The 1/4&#34; clearance keeps you from shaving too close and gives a nice all-over short look - no strays here!", "These are pretty standard Bic disposable razors.  They work well and give you a fairly close shave.  The &#34;special&#34; feature of this type is the &#34;trimmer&#34; that's included. What you actually get is a small plastic cover that fits over the razor head which keeps it from cutting down to the skin.  There is one cover per pack that you are supposed to save and use with the different razors. It's supposedly for trimming the &#34;bikini&#34; area.  Let's just say that it is not exactly a comfortable experience when used as a trimmer.  It's not something I'd try again or recommend for that purpose.  The razors are fine although nothing new or different.", "Frankly, I couldn't tell a difference between this and comparable products. This comes with a bikini trimmer that I only used once for the sake of this review and probably won't use again. However, both the razor offered a close shave and I didn't feel the need to go over the same spot more than once. The trimmer....nope. I think the curves of a woman's crotch area are too complex for a trimmer that accompanies disposable razors. Perhaps it's because I've never been one to toy with the hair &#34;down there&#34; so the trimmer had more to reckon with?The thing that gave me the most issue was the plastic cover on the blade; getting it off was harder than it should have been.In short, unless you are the type that pays attention to your bikini area enough to want it trimmed regularly, I'd skip the premium and just stick with the standard Bic Soleil Twilight razors.", "In the package you get 3 shavers and 1 &#34;trim shaver.&#34; The shavers are same as other BIC Soleil's that I have, so I already know that I really like them. The trim shaver is just a waste to me. #1 I'm not saving it for a month to use with the other shavers in the package. And #2 I like a close shave, so this is pointless to me. Overall maybe it would be right for someone traveling, in that they could upkeep themselves, but I am not sure that it would be worth the money to purchase this every month. It is not something that would work for me and I threw out the trim shaver.", "This product does exactly what it's supposed to! I have never gotten razor burn or cut myself with these razors.I especially love the bikini trimmer, it's perfect for it's job. I would definitely recommend this product.", "What a clever idea. Remember to slide the covers off rather than flip them off as is often the case. 3 shavers plus 1 trimmer. Small parts. Works as expected.", "I'm not usually a big fan of disposable razors, simply because they are usually quite cheap and in my opinion don't hold up to the quality of a razor with replaceable cartridges.The Bic Soleil Shave and Trim Shaver has a good handle that fits comfortably in my hand. You get 4 shavers and a Bikini trimmer attachment, which you slide over the razor when you want to &#34;trim&#34; the bikini area area removing all the hair.It's a nice concept and you can use it just when you need to, taking it off when you shave other areas. I didn't use that item too much for the fact that it is not needed.As for the closeness of the shave, I was pretty impressed on how well it worked without any nicks or cuts to my legs. It has a small strip of aloe at the top and there are 3 blades, which is ok for a decent shave.  I have had them a while and only just switched out to the second razor, so they last quite a while.Overall , a fair price for 3 disposable razors.", "This package contains three complete Soleil razors, which do have heads that can be replaced.  They have three blades and give a nice, close shave.  I had no issues with razor burn.  Not my favorite razor ever, but it does do a good job and is pretty maneuverable.  The unique part of this set is the trimmer.  There is one included, and it is a fairly sturdy piece of plastic that slides over the razor.  I wasn't in love with the trimmer.  Despite the fact that you can't adjust the length of the trim, I found that it didn't give me a very even result.  It did, however, work better than other at-home options I've tried.  (I have sensitive skin, so chemical options such as depilatory creams are out.)  The razor and the trimmer are both easy to clean, which helps them last longer.  This is a nice set overall, although I wish I had something better to store it in than the silly torso container.", "This shaver works great!  The regular blades, shave my legs and the area around the crotch.  By adding the attachment, to the shaver, you can get a nice safe shave on and around the nether regions.Even at my age, I don't want to look down and see a jungle, so am so happy to get this job done in the shower.I think my bikini days are over, but I still want to look nice in me undies, so I'll tidy up  with this nifty razor combo, everyday.", "I got these for my wife to try out, and as far as the razor goes, it works about as you would expect. It gives a decent shave, although right out of the package the blade seemed to be a bit on the dull side (the other included blades ended up being noticeably better). If it's all you've got, it does the job, but there are definitely better disposables out there. That an $8 (MSRP) razor comes with dull blades was on the disappointing side and didn't exactly inspire confidence that &#34;trimming&#34; would be any better. It wasn't, and basically the blade dulled very quickly while the trimmer guard is clogged, requiring constant cleaning. My wife really didn't seem to like the experience and even went so far as to say that it just &#34;didn't work&#34; for her.As a razor, the Bic Soleil Shave and Trim is adequate, if overpriced. As a trimmer, it seems to fail miserably and just doesn't give you the kind of control you need around sensitive areas to actually do a good job. If you couple that with a dull blade (which some of them are), then you're looking at disappointment and a product that accomplishes exactly the opposite of what is advertised.", "Good product. It offers a close shave and is sleek and stylish. I would recomend it to a friend and I would gladly purchase it again.", "When it comes to this type of grooming, the best is professional waxing. If you choose the DIY route, the Bic Soleil Shave and Trim seems like a good alternative. Other options for home hair removal include depilatories, but not for the bikini area, I hope, and that Epi-Lady contraption that grabs the hairs a few at a time and rips them out. Yeah. Right. Just as soon as I finish poking my eye with a stick.Anyway, most of us choose shaving.  The Bic is the first to combine a shaver and a trimmer. Smart stuff. You can use the razor for a clean, hairless shave in certain areas and the trimmer to groom others.  Both are both kept in that little torso container, so they stay handy. In theory. The shaver is a good one, with 3 blades for a close, smooth shave, and a pivoting head that glides over curves easily. I've used those wand-shaped trimmers before, but this removes hair more easily and moves better, probably because of the triple razors and fancy pivoting. The trimmer attachment slips onto the razor and stays in place until you take it off. It has 1/4 inch of clearance, which is a good length.  Remember, you do need something to work with; if there's not 1/2 an inch of material to shave down there, there is nothing for the trimmer to get hold of.The problems with shaving are it must be done very often, there is rough stubble, and some skin types react by going bumpy.  The Bic Soleil provides partial solutions to all of these.  The trimmer is made especially for grooming in this area. By not cutting down to the surface of the skin, the stubble situation isn't as bad, and so far so good regarding the bumps. By the way, these can be prevented with some smart shaving techniques (except for very sensitive skin). If they do happen, they are treatable.Bumps occur when hair follicles are irritated or infected. A clean, sharp razor and light touch help prevent this.  Pressing down irritates the skin. If you need to go over an area, take your second sweep in the direction of hair growth so there's less pull. Shave in the shower. Hot water steams open follicles, and washing first removes dead skin that can harbor bacteria. And good exfoliation, particularly on the legs, will eliminate ingrown hairs. Also, always use a good quality shaving lotion. It holds hair up so the razor can cut cleanly, provides 'glide' and essential moisture. And don't shave too often. Every other day at the most.Afterwards, rinse in cold water and, if you like, try an after-shave preparation with salicylic acid or glycolic acid and aloe vera. In any case, the last step should ALWAYS be a splash of witch hazel. The stuff is magic. It's anti-bacterial, a very nice toner for the face and body, and tightens the skin. It can even help tighten eye bags (a little), and it helps skin retain moisture.But back to the razor...it's not perfect, but it is the best among the similar products that I've tried, and I've tried most brands. It has the trimmer option which others don't, the trimmer works well, and it helps eliminate some of the skin issues resulting from shaving. So, Five stars...Brazilian if they have any.", "I don't know what it is about disposable razors, but I just find them to be exactly what you pay for- cheap abuse of your sensitive skin. Unfortunately, these Bic disposables are no different than any other disposable razor. It gave me horrendous and painful razor burn, and still somehow managed to leave behind stubble. How does that happen?The trimmer is what intrigued me about these razors. It is a plastic piece that slides over the existing razor head. It has a guard and a blade inside, and you must drag it against the grain to truly trim your bikini line. It doesn't get as close as an electric trimmer, but it doesn't do a bad job at all! In fact, if you like to landscape a bit without getting too carried away, this trimmer is for you.But unfortunately, I wouldn't buy this package because of the razors themselves. They really aren't any better than any other disposable razor brand- quite awful in comparison to the other of doing things with your razor and replaceable blades!", "I love that this doubles as both a regular razor and a bikini trimmer. I've been using Bic Soleil razors for a long time, and I love this new product. Easy to use and gets the job done!", "I did not expect much from this shaver. I have been perpetually disappointed. Finally, a shaver for me. There are 2 parts to this shaver, the one-piece shaver itself and an additional slide on head with a comb that trims. Both parts are effectively sharp without being too sharp. Both work great at what they are meant to do. Finally!Please don't buy them all. Save some for me.", "I have used Bic razors many times, & they are usually very good quality. The price is also very reasonable because there are four razors in each package.", "I like the Bic Soleil Shave and trim Shaver.  It gives a good, close shave without nicks and cuts that can result with some other shavers.  I found it comfortable and easy to use.  I tried the bikini attachment.  It was okay, but unnecessary for my use.  It did however make setting a length of shave easy and effortless.  There was no need to go over the same areas multiple times and I found it very good for a disposable razor.", "This is a razor designed for ladies, and made by bic. The razor itself seems fairly typical of bic products. Lightweight, plastic, and pink and purple. There are more blades in it then a typical bic. You get 4 razors.The blade and feel seems more low-end than other razors I use. The first time I shaved my legs with it, I got a nick. That doesn't happen with my regular brand. The small form factor feels less substantial than other razors.The bikini trimmer works well, and is an interesting innovation. It does lift the hair and cut quickly and fast.I can't say this is a product I would repurchase. I prefer razors which have more substantial feel in my hand, and which just have replaceable blades. But this is inexpensive solution for those who don't want to replace their razor blades on their own.", "The razors were good but the single attachment to trim didn't work as well as others I have used in the past. I ended up giving up on the trimmer and just using the razors.", "I wasn't expecting much from this razor considering that it is by Bic. But I was surprised that it did a better job than the Schick disposables I had been using. The blades are sharp and shave the hair very quickly. I like that the head doesn't pivot. I tried the Venus trimmer that it is similar to this and hated it. This one is much better, it grabs the hair quickly and easily. This brand is also MUCH cheaper than Gillette and Schick razors. Unfortunately, the blades do seem to dull quickly and I found that I would have spots that bled on my bikini area because it was too dull. This was after using it only once. I did not have this problem with my legs, but if I can't use it on my bikini area it's not worth buying."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.033151473850011826, 0.03259490057826042, 0.0388464480638504, 0.03868941590189934, 0.026901477947831154, 0.02900640480220318, 0.03350699692964554, 0.03561875596642494, 0.032309096306562424, 0.03252613544464111, 0.028928495943546295, 0.0297593642026186, 0.03965328633785248, 0.03554623946547508, 0.02996109053492546, 0.02461772970855236, 0.03420074284076691, 0.031094614416360855, 0.018847370520234108, 0.027254309505224228, 0.035658277571201324, 0.027018822729587555, 0.03318920359015465, 0.029509978368878365, 0.02593904733657837, 0.02846762351691723, 0.03442305326461792, 0.03406953439116478, 0.032436586916446686, 0.02674013376235962, 0.03248818591237068, 0.02704525925219059]]}
