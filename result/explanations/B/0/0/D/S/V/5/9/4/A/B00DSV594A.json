In the bottom of that inner base were the two cords that the speaker uses and a very small instruction sheet.  One of the cables is a coiled headphone style cable, the other is a headphone style cable that also has a USB plug on one end.  The coiled cable is used for listening to the speaker, and the cable with the USB plug on it is used for charging the device.When I plug the speaker into a computer to charge it, I hear a very slight hum out of the speaker.  I know that it's on and charging this way, and I don't find it to be really noticeable as long as there is anything else going on in the room, including just my computer running.  If I had it plugged into a wall adapter in a silent room, I'm sure it would be more noticeable, but the way I'm charging it I simply don't notice the hum.When you plug a cable into the speaker, a very faint green light appears near the input on the speaker itself.  This green light goes on whether you have the USB style plug hooked up or just the headphone cable, so I believe this light just means that the speaker is &#34;on.&#34;  The included manual doesn't mention anything about any lights, so I'm not sure if you are really even supposed to be able to see this light...but if you look, you can see it.  I've noticed on my speaker that at times there is also a red light that is visible on the opposite side of the plug input from the green light.  I BELIEVE this to be a light that indicates that the speaker is fully charged, but again, this isn't mentioned in the manual so I'm not 100% sure that's what it's for.  The lights are so hard to see, and they are blocked by the cable when it's plugged in, so I can't help but believe that you're just not really supposed to see them.What the manual DOES say about charging is that you should allow 4-8 hours of charging time before the first use.  This makes me think even more that the lights are visible but they weren't originally intended to be an indicator of the state of charge.  This can make charging into some guesswork, but it's not really that big of a deal.  Plug it in when it's dead and unplug it when you wake up in the morning, and you're good to go.The speaker has a nice suction cup base that allows it to be stuck to flat surfaces.  In my experience, the suction cup works really well.  I was able to stick it to any non-porous surface and have it stay there until I took it off, which is equally easy by just pulling on the tab on the side of the suction cup.Just to see what the whole thing was all about, I pried mine out of the rubber housing.  The speaker is just a small ball with the plug input and a small pole on the bottom that helps the suction cup base stay more rigid.  It was easy enough to get out, and easy enough to get back in.  However, there's really no reason to pull it out of it's base, so don't worry about how easy it is to get in or out.The thing that I liked the most about the speaker is the sound.  It's not a whole lot louder than the speaker in my iPhone, and it does get a bit distorted when I turn the volume all the way up (but then, so do my nice headphones, so that's more on the iPhone's end than any speaker's end), but what it does is just sound a lot &#34;fuller&#34; than the built in speaker.  I hope that makes sense.  There's a bit more bass, a bit more mid range, and the highs just sound less &#34;tinny.&#34;  Sure, it doesn't sound as good as a nice high end surround sound system or car stereo, but it certainly sounds about as good as I could hope a small pod speaker could sound all on it's own.  I was listening to it when my wife came into the room, and even she mentioned how good the music sounded and asked what it was that I was using...and she's the type of person that literally doesn't care what stuff sounds like.  So, if it can manage to impress her, then I believe it should be able to impress just about anyone.  Different genres of music all sounded better than they do on just the phone's speaker, and I really enjoyed listening to the speaker with my library of music.The small coiled speaker cable is great at staying out of the way, as well.  You don't have to worry about getting it tangled up on anything.  My main way of using it was to stand my iPhone up on it's side, stick the speaker to the top of my computer, and then use the speaker as a bit of a stand for my iPhone.  Worked like a charm!!!Other users have mentioned that the speaker cable requires some &#34;work&#34; to get it so that it's not giving any static in the music playback, however, try as I might I could NOT get the speaker to give me any static.  I'm not sure if the manufacturer has upgraded the cable or I just had good luck, but I was pleased with how well the cable worked.In closing, I really like this little speaker.  It sounds really good for it's size, which I believe is about the most important aspect of a speaker.  It's suction cup feature is a nice addition.  The ONLY downside to the speaker is the fact that it's a bit difficult to tell if it's fully charged, charging, or what.  I know you can see that light, but again I'm not sure if that's intended or just kind of an accident.  If it is intended, it should be documented on the manual sheet, and if it's not, then they should take advantage of that and put an LED on the outside of the speaker for you to be able to tell what exactly the speaker is doing.  This confusion regarding the charging is the only thing holding this product back from a full five star rating from me.***FULL DISCLOSURE***I was sent a unit for testing by the manufacturer, however, my opinion and rating were not rewarded or compensated in any way.", "SUCTION CUP BASE:The Aleratec iSx1 Portable Mini Speaker with its suction cup base stands out in the very populated category of portable mini speakers. The suction cup base is a wonderfully useful feature. My gripe with other chorded portable mini speakers is they are great so long as you are fine with placing the speaker and smartphone or tablet on a desk and leaving it there because holding a portable speaker attached to a smartphone or tablet for any amount of time is awkward at best.The Aleratec remedies this awkwardness with its suction cup base. Simply stick the portable speaker to the back of a smartphone, tablet, or notebook screen with the suction cup. You get superior sound compared to the built in speaker from a smartphone, tablet, or notebook and can easily walk around with the device or hold it to watch a video. The portable speaker is light weight and the suction cup is strong enough that it has no problem sticking to the back of a smartphone, tablet, or notebook screen for extended periods. I've stuck it to a surface, let the speaker set for a couple of hours, and it was still firmly suctioned to the surface when I came back.FEATURES:The Aleratec portable speaker features a rubber suction cup shell that encompasses all but the top of the speaker. The speaker stays nicely in place within the rubber shell but you can easily pull it out if you so desire. The portable speaker has a very simple design. It features a single input jack that is used for both playing audio and charging. There is no on/off button or volume dial. The portable speaker comes with a short coiled audio cable and a USB charging cable. The USB charging cable is a &#34;Y&#34; cable. On one end is a 3 ring connector for the portable speaker and on the other end is the USB connector for charging and a 2 ring connector to listen to music while charging.CHARGING:My main complaints with the Aleratec portable speaker center around charging and its lack of an ON/OFF button. When a cable is connected to the portable speaker's jack, the speaker turns on, as visible by a very faint green light within the jack and the slight amount of noise coming from the speaker. I have to cup my hands around the area of the jack and rotate the speaker to the right angle to see the green light but it is there. When a cable is connected,  the speaker being on, is ready to receive an audio signal whether or not the other end is connected to an audio source. If it isn't connected to an audio source, I at times hear a faint humming sound or static from the speaker if something brushes against the other end of the cable. This can be problematic when charging because the 3 ring connector end is plugged into the speaker while the other end has the USB connector for charging and a 2 ring connector for audio. This means unless the speaker is connected to an audio source when charging you at times hear a faint humming sound or static from the speaker. While I like the simplistic design of the Aleratec, an ON/OFF button or switch would avoid this.My other complaint is there is no way to tell when the portable speaker is actively charging or done charging. The faint green light turns on whether you connect a cable for charging or to play audio. As long as a cable is connected to the jack in the speaker the faint green light stays on and doesn't turn off or change colors even if charging is complete. I've left the speaker connected to a charger for 16 hours and the faint green light just stays lit.PROS:1. Suction cup base. Stays suctioned to surface for long periods of time.2. Short coiled audio cable doesn't get in the way when speaker is suctioned to the back of a smartphone or tablet.3. Noticeable improvement in audio quality and volume compared to built in speakers of my iPhone, iPad, and Macbook Air.4. Simplistic design. I like that it doesn't have a volume dial on the speaker. With other portable mini speakers I always leave the volume at max on the speaker and control the volume from my iPhone.CONS:1. No ON/OFF button. Hear faint humming sound and static at times when charging unless the portable speaker is connected to an audio source.2. Because the speaker is &#34;ON&#34; as long as a cable is connected to it you can't leave a cable connected to the speaker when not in use. This goes against my natural desire to keep the audio cable connected to the portable speaker when not in use so the cable doesn't get lost.3. The green &#34;ON&#34; light is very hard to see.4. No way to tell if the portable speaker is actively charging or done charging.5. While the sound quality from the Aleratec is noticeable better than the built in speaker of my iPhone, iPad, and Macbook Air, it isn't quite as good as the sound quality of a couple other similarly priced portable mini speakers I have. The Aleratec speaker is a little smaller than the other portable mini speakers which I'm sure account for the smaller sound.SUMMARY:I love the suction cup base along with the short coiled audio cable that stays out of the way. I found the Aleratec portable speaker to be most useful with my iPhone and Macbook Air. I usually set my iPad on my lap when using it so the portable suction cup speaker wasn't functional with it. The Aleratec portable speaker is a good product so long as you are fine with the cons which center around charging and the lack of an ON/OFF button.Note: A product sample was provided by the seller in exchange for a fair, unbiased review.", "I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. It's not quite a 5, but it's a nice little speaker.Pros:1. I know that other reviewer's experiences were slightly different, but I'm getting great sound out of mine. It's way better than trying to use the speaker from my iPhone alone, and surprisingly good for a mini speaker.2. I love the compact size and the aesthetics of the ball shape. It's a visually nice thing.3. The suction cup is a great idea for keeping the cute speaker attached to the device that's playing it.4. The coiled cable is a great idea for keeping the cord controlled.5. It's nicely packaged, making it a good for gift giving.6. Comes with the cables you need.7. Comes with a 1-year warranty.Middlin' things:1. Suction cups sometimes need a little help to stay stuck to things and this one is no exception.2. I think that $20 is the right price point for this handy little thingCons:1. I would prefer an off switch, e.g., because it does buzz just a tiny bit when it's charging.2. I would prefer some indication of how fully the battery is charged.It's very cute. I really admire the visual design of this, and the sound I'm getting is very good for a mini speaker.", "I received a free sample of this product in return for a review, but note that my reviews are fair and unbiased at all times. I call them as I see them.This highly portable speaker is meant to attach to a smartphone or maybe a tablet as a small and simple external speaker. It comes with two cables; one for USB charging, and one for attaching to the desired device. The latter is coiled and stretches to just under a foot in length. The coil idea is clever and makes for easy storage; I just leave it attached at all times when I'm not charging the speaker's internal battery.How well does it work? The sound quality is decent if you keep in mind the small form factor. Don't expect sizzling highs and booming lows. Do expect a surprisingly full and clear sound with good definition. The 1.5 watt output (not sure what input this is obtained with, I suppose 1 volt RMS or something) is enough for a small table in a small conference room or maybe a small patio. If you want to fill a concert hall, get something larger.The pros: light, portable, easy to use, very practical,  good sound for the size. Has a suction cup on the bottom. This is really clever and you can stick the speaker to the back of your phone and carry it around if you like.The cons: no lights or controls. You have to guess when it's fully charged, or just charge it long enough to be safe. There's no volume control; the speaker runs at a fixed amplification and volume is changed via source device. This makes overdriving the speaker, with consequent distortion, more likely. These two objections combined knock a star off the rating.Bottom line: the market for such speakers is crowded. I've myself reviewed a couple of others and many more are out there. Some sound better and some have more and better lights/controls. Some sound worse, and many cost more. None of them have the clever coiled cord or the even more clever suction cup. So I would say if you want ultimate portability while retaining decent audio quality, this is a good choice.", "This is a nice little speaker that is easy to charge.  Just plug it into a powered usb plug and charge it up.  This speaker is better in the higher range than the lower ranges.I haven't really needed to use the suction cup but I did test it out and it worked fine.  Overall, there is nothing exceptional either good or bad about this speaker and for me that is the problem.For roughly twice the price you can get this speaker.DKnight Magicbox Ultra-Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker,Powerful Sound with build in microphone, Works for Iphone, Ipad Mini, Ipad 4/3/2, Itouch, Blackberry, Nexus, Samsung and other Smart Phones and Mp3 Players (Black).  I much prefer not having to mess with wires and with this Bluetooth speaker I don't.  This speaker also sounds better.  To me these speakers are in the same ballpark for price so I would pick the bluetooth one every time.  If $30 is too steep for a speaker, then this one will work.  However, there are many choices for speakers in this price range.Overall, this is a decent speaker and if bluetooth is not important to you or the ability to stick the speaker to a window or other smother surface is important to you, then this could be a great speaker for you.A product sample was provided by the manufacturer for review purposes.", "I was offered this speaker to try out and review, and I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised with this little thing.The sound when connected to my iPod Touch 4th Generation is surprisingly loud and clear. It's sufficiently loud in fact, that I was able to listen to music a room away from where I had the speaker set up.The device itself is just a little larger than a golf ball (with a suction cup) and it has a nice looking, black matte, rubberized finish. I had no problem sticking the speaker to the back of my notebook computer, the face of my Galaxy Note 2 and a coffee table. The speaker comes with two very short cables (one is for charging and listening simultaneously, and one is for listening only), that I would have liked twice as long as the one that was supplied. It's not a huge deal, but a twelve inch cord really limits what you can do with the little thing.I DID have some random noise with the speaker plugged in to my notebook's USB and 3.5 mm audio out jack, but I've had similar problems with some other speakers, so I might just be some interference that is specific to my notebook.Overall, for the price at the time of my review, I think this speaker is a good bargain. I probably wouldn't have purchased it on my own because I wouldn't have believed the loudness  and quality of sound that this little thing puts out; but having had a chance to try it, I'm really glad that I got a chance to review it.", "QUICK SUMMARY:  This is an inexpensive, very compact speaker.  As such, don't expect frills, functions, or high fidelity sound.  Expect sound that is louder than your iPhone, and that is about all.BACKGROUND:  I used this vendor-supplied speaker with my iPhone to write this review.  The best-use scenario for me is using this speaker outside, next to my spa, where I have no other access to music other than to play it through my iPhone's tiny little speakers.  With the iPhone's volume turned up, the volume I get from this speaker is louder than my iPhone's speakers (oddly, at half-volume, my iPhone is louder, though, than this speaker!).  Secondly, if you like playing music at low-levels at a desk (workplace environment, say) but with a little more fidelity and volume than mobile phone can deliver, then this might work for that, too.  It can be used with tablets, too, but I didn't use it for that.WHAT I LIKE:- Rechargeable, internal battery- With my iPhone volume turned up to nearly full volume, the loudness of this speaker is greater than my iPhone's loudness- Seems rugged, like it could be dropped to the floor a few times without breaking- The speaker grill is made of steel- Very compact, easy to transportWHAT I DID NOT LIKE:- No on/off switch.  I'm not sure how, but the speaker discharged itself after I briefly used it the first time (because the audio cord was still plugged into the speaker, I guess?)- No LED lights to indicate battery level, charging status, or when the battery has reached full recharge level- Recharging is through a proprietary cable that plugs into a USB port then recharges through the audio port on the speaker (I'd much prefer a micro USB port on the speaker as I have dozens of micro USB cords lying about)- The short cord used to connect the speaker to a device is really too short if you're using it with an iPhone and you still want to use your iPhone (it would be okay if you're sticking the speaker on your tablet's surface, I suppose).WHAT COULD BE BETTER:- The 360-degree claim is a little misleading.  If the speaker is pointing straight up, it's true that you're listening experience is the same no matter where you sit, but the volume from the speaker is focused, so it will sound loudest/strongest if the speaker grill is pointing right at your ears- I have no use for the suction cup; would be nice if it were detachable so if you don't need it, you can remove it- The form factor isn't ideal, either; I'd prefer a cube or similar shape that would make it easier to place on other surfaces, like my bed comforter- I wish it had a Bluetooth connection instead of a corded connection, because the greater fidelity of a corded connection is lost on a speaker like this, so why not go for clutter-free connection of Bluetooth?CONCLUSION:  Be sure you know how you're going to use a compact speaker like this, where you're going to use it, and what you're going to expect from it.  For me, I'd take a pass on this speaker and look for better alternatives."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.28175270557403564, 0.11216559261083603, 0.033516716212034225, 0.30766424536705017, 0.2638608515262604, 0.00040558091131970286, 0.0006343520362861454]]}
