I bought this for battlfield 4 - and will easily play this for a year. It's nice having Battlefield finally look really good and run so smooth. Very fun! More games I'm interested in come out in a few months,and this game alone will keep me busy.User Interface - Excellent. Never thought I would say this, but the UI is so smooth, fast, and flawless, that I actually don't mind paying $50/year for PS+ (which is required now for gaming) Sony seems to have done their homework - and this provides an excellent experience for gamers.  Many will say, \"\"why don't you just get a PC?\"\"  Well, the UI gives gamers and experience that I have yet to experience on my PC.Wobble? - I became concerned when ppl were posting videos on PS4 \"\"wobbling\"\" when you push down on a corner. So the first thing I did was try this out. This is such a joke - you have to apply about 8 pounds of pressure to a corner for it to \"\"wobble\"\". This will be the very last time I need to push down on it - as all buttons are in the front, and disk loads in the front as well. Talk about ppl being to fussy. This would be like me saying the xbox one has terrible build quality because the kinect tips over when I push down on it.Cons-Bundled mic/mono headset: This thing is a joke, and very poor quality. Does not fit in my ear, and is too quiet, cannot hear people talking. Sony bundled the headset to encourage ppl to use communication during gameplay, but I feel this is the same as not bundling a headset at all. I will be using my usb headset instead and tossing this one in the trash. Which leads me to:USB: Only two usb ports. I wish it at least had three. I would like to charge controller, use usb headset, and have my wireless keyboard plugged in at once. May not seem like a big deal, but I'm hoping to get lots of years out of this machine, and unplugging and replugging stuff will only ad to wear and tear.500GB hard drive: This may seem like a lot, but I know I will have to upgrade in the future. My one game I have requires about 38 gigs of space, and Killzone will need 50gb. Yes , this is even if you have the disk. Day 2 with console and I only have 320 gigs left. I can see requiring to upgrade to a 2tb in the next year or so.Summary: I give this system 5 stars despite the cons, because I feel that I am getting my money's worth. For 400 bucks I have a system that will entertain me for many years to come. Please note that I am not one of those \"\"fanboys\"\", who have blind pride in a system and will bash another. The Xbox one looks amazing too - I have always been with xbox. I did my research, and the ps4 is for me - at least for now.\"", "im not a fan of fanboys from affiliated with other game consoles putting down another console and trying to twist people to buy their prefered console. ive had the ps4 about two weeks and it is just nice. still some loading  but bigger power can still mean more of the same. but if it is so nice now i wonder how it will evolve with later firmware. ive had no problems and no reason to hate in and i can say the system is enjoyable to a gamer. if you read the manual some problems wouldnt be a problem, it overheats and if you play it to much it will breakdown so play it casually or find a way of cooling it down. also the manual indictaes a few odd rules about how to plug the thing in correctly. it might have a grounding issue but its minor. its unknown why you plug this device in frist before all other devices but its in the manual. the manual is usually a good maintainance. if you didnt follow some of thje odd instructions you may fry the system or upset it in a small way. its not ther perfect system but when treated correctly it has breathtaking visuals and great experiences. it may not be everyones favorite controller eithert but it can do more because of how many buttons you have access to. touchpad controls are easy too, very sensitive in fact. my system has shown no errors so far and i havnt upgraded the hard drive yet but with the heat issue be careful of how much power you put i their becuase you may again upset sytem and have it break down. so perhaps it needs to be better before hot swapping.the next ps4 slim or whatever will be more efficient in heat and cooling issues hopefully. most slims are. this system has a good hardware combo in it making it very powerful. in opinion the processor and graphics card are better but it also contributes to the heat problem from the power it draws. just like the ps3 it uses alot of power and will likely again get better with the slims. from what ive also heard about the xbox one is that it has a larger vent to let off heat. whether or not one is more efficient than the other is unknown to me but the ps4 puts out heat similar to the ps3 instead of the xbox ones exhaust like approach.i have a day one edition which comes with $30 worth of codes for the playstation network. 30 days of playstation plus, 30 days of music unlimited and a $10 dollar psn voucher. i was already a plus member but it doesnt expire and i dont know if i want music on my ps4 given the size of installs. but what is great about installing is you can play a portion of the game at first. for example the whole entirety of battlefield 4's story was uploaded in maybe 3 seconds from disc and he whole game was loaded nearly a minute or two later. without the higher download speeds of foriegn countries americans are lookling at maybe 100 megs tops for a premium while china has the luxury of 1000 megs. or at least that is what ive heard on the radio. so americans buy disks or wait especially if you have 15 megs. it took 30 minutes to download a single expansion on 15 megs and most updates are large as well. its okay for now but imagine having to download 4500 megs at 15 megs which is about 10 mb per second wireless. this system will be limited by your internet service because it can do a great many things just not fast enough with poor quality internet.im trying to keep a quality review and not really piock a side so instead i just shared what i know an have expereinced. i have yet to play an xbox one so i dont know its true power either but the basics are definitely available in the ps4. if you do buy a ps4 take care of it and it should be fine", "I am extremely happy with the system,and still can not believe I got it.After checking multiple stores I found that all were sold out,and would not give me an estimate on how long they would be out of stock.Luckily,I got on amazon and saw this bundle was available with limited supplies.I could have not clicked any faster as soon as I started ordering it there was ten left.I completed my order and as soon as I checked again they were out of stock! I got the last one on that shipment and I am enjoying it,the graphics,physics,possibilities with these next gen systems has got me so excited.Can't wait and hope to see you online!", "I got my PS4 11/15/2013 when i got back home to open it up and i was happy. But that happiness didn't last long, the PS4 HDMI port was no good. If you know Kotaku gaming news group had HDMI problems as well but my PS4 problem want beyond that to were the system didn't want to enter safe mode at all. I try everything you could do but nothing work. Console had blinking blue light as well when trying to enter safe mode and that safe mode sound never beep twice only turn off the console.I wanted to have blast with the PS4 like anyone else who want out to pre-order the PS4, there is no reason why console shouldn't work at all. Every console should have been tested before shipping start and made sure nothing was wrong with them. So Amazon can only offer me refund and return of the shipment using UPS ground to send the console back. It's not Sony or Amazon fault but the manufacture who puts the console together for overlooking bad parts to the hardware and its back ports not working. I'm not the only person who got bad unit but it would be good to make sure to have back-up's in case some unit turn out not working at all like my PS4.From now on i'm never going to buy console on its first day unless i know for 100% that it has been test before shipping to me. I'm buying from store i see in person not online anymore and i'll be sharing video about this unit not working as well once i get my hands on working PS4 later on my YouTube.", "I love this console, I got it and so far I haven't Had any problems. I also own a ps vita and these two consoles are amazing together. This generation hasn't been the biggest step up as it has been in the past but i must say its a worthy console. the graphics are are on-par with low to mid range gaming pc's, Battlefield 4 runs at 900p and the x bone can only run it at 720. I will update this review to let you guys know how it is working.", "The ps4 is great, nice finished & great controls. Didn't have any issues with the machine so far, was well packaged and resisted a travel way back to Colombia. My recommendation is to buy it at a retailer store and buy the replacement plan if something goes wrong or just wait the 2nd generation machines. Also if you own a ps3 give it some life with the ps+ is really great didn't have it until now, so I think I'll enjoing both for some time.I really sorry for all the people who's ps4 didn't work out including my brother's who also bought it at amazon. We tried everything, change the hdd, all the guides that sony posted but didn't work, just the blue light of dead, also tried in safe mode but after 4 hours trying we actually made it but then the machine got blocked. His ps4 was the launch edition.", "This is the best console ever a lot better than ps3 even though its missing a few features i'm so into this that I can wait for them to update it other than that this blows Xbox one outta the water and I see no way on how it can beat this. Works perfect been playing all day and has no problems like Xbox trolls were saying on ign.", "This failing idea that Sony and Microsoft had of refusing to make their consoles backwards compatible is wrong.  I may adjust this review later when more games come out but seeing how I am restricted to PS4 games, it's very s***7y.I am sure others know more than I about hardware.  The system 'looks' neat but effectively is an overly expensive and awkward paperweight.I suggest others wait two or three years, maybe Sony will bring their head out and into the sunlight.", "Such a great system...I was late to switch from PS2 to PS3 but was hooked once I got on board.  I didn't waste anytime this go around...I pre-ordered the PS4 and have loved every minute of it.  It is so intuitive to use and the interface is fantastic.  The seamless integration of &#34;sharing&#34; your experiences on Facebook, Twitter or Twitch is really cool.  Oh and the games are great too!", "Other than a slew sad launch titles I am absolutely loving it so far.The systems are near silent and other than a few network related hiccups that all new system launches seem to have, we have four out of four systems running flawlessly (4 Days non-stop now!). The dashboard is instantaneous going both into and out of games and systems are always quick and responsive no matter what we ask them to do. But there does need to be more &#34;good&#34; games... It is pretty sad that Resogun, a free game, is probably one of the best games available.", "Awesome, simply awesome. I have been gaming since Nintendo 8 bit, and had everything from sega to jaguar to xbox and all manner of gaming platform in between. Its incredible to see what it has evolved into. In my opinion, anyone trashing this system is an Xbox employee, or was unlucky and got a defective product.The ps4 operates more like a computer, it hasn't frozen, instead it crashes to desktop and sends an error report when there is a problem, a tremendous improvement from the ps3 freeze.I haven't tried any video, music, etc service....don't care about that, I use it for games......I Have a pc that I can use for everything elseGraphics are insane, operates smoothly, looks fantastic. This thing purrs. Its a Ferrari.UI is ok, kinda bland, but who cares really, i don't play the UINew controller is great, a true improvementLights on the system/controller are ok, not as distracting as i thought it would be in a dark room.Ps4 is worth the hype, it lived up to it.If you are an Xbox fan you should be excited, next gen is sick, and if the xbox is anything like the ps4 you will love it. And if it isnt, dont worry, jump ship to the ps4 and enjoy. It's a gaming powerhouse.As far as bugs go, who can say....on launch day it took a bit to get online and play, but wasnt too much of a wait. I was upset at first and worried that it was going to be defective, or a brick. However, once I got online and played, oh baby, my fears went away and I am thoroughly impressed.Also comes with a free month of live plus, and a $10 live giftcard.Headset is a little bit of nothing, haven't tried it yet, look like crap.", "this console was a decent launch, but plagued with launch day issues, people get booted out of games randomly for no reason amongst other bugs. some cannot play. the system itself is well designed, and priced appropriately for the most part. the controller still looks like it's a beta design. this is a great console overall, but you should probably wait a few years to purchase one.", "Perfect as soon as they add back in DLNA, MP3, CD, 3D Blu-Ray and everything else missing that was on PS3. I bought 7 launch titles from all the buy 2 get 1 free offers on different sites. So it wasn't too bad. I've been playing my PS4 for over 24 hours now, it runs perfectly, and all the games I have are really fun and look great. Knack is WAY better than the reviews give credit for. Don't trust them. I usually follow reviews closely and only buy good games, but Target didn't have much in stock so I had to get Knack to get a 3rd game. I wasn't going to open it at first, but I did anyway and it's amazingly fun. I think the reviews were bad because they weren't paid off by Sony like Microsoft does for it's reviews.PS4 runs hot, put out a lot of heat, but I keep mine out in the open so it has plenty of ventilation.", "UPS delivered my PS4 bright and early on Friday and then I had to wait an interminable 7 hours before actually getting to hook the thing up.  I knew that there was a day one update that was mandantory before I could really do anything and that is where I ran into my first problem.  I went through the initial set-up and put in my wifi password and it started downloading the update.  It got to within 30mb of being completed and gave me an error.  It started downloading again, got to about the same spot and stopped again.  After the third attempt at downloading I started searching and found that Sony had the file available on the Playstation site so I downloaded it from there, followed their install instructions and it worked.  Too bad I wasted 45 minutes of failed downloads before trying it.Things went pretty smooth after the install.  I logged in using my Playstation Network ID and it ported over everything related to that.  I messed around with the navigation bar and it felt new, but also familiar.  I certainly didn't feel lost and new exactly what I needed to do.  That's a good sign.  I put in my first game, Assasin's Creed IV, and it immediately started installing the game.  This is where things got interesting.  With the PS4, Sony is requiring the game to be installed to the console.  You can't play it without the disc, but it is basically like an unlock key.  This allows for some pretty neat things that PS3 owners should love.  AC4 came with many codes for costumes and weapons so I started inputting those.  On the PS3, you would have to quit the game and input codes and then go back to the game.  With the PS4, it basically pauses the game, allows you to do whatever you need, then you can just continue.  It is seamless, quick and works like a charm.  I was very impressed.  However, this is also when I ran into my second problem.  Sony's servers were going down, which is why I couldn't download the update, and it was also causing problems connecting to the Playstation Network.  I managed to get a few codes entered, but that was it.  I started getting error after error.  I finally gave up and just started playing the game.  I was never able to access the PSN for the rest of that first night.  Even into Saturday, I continued to see the message that the PSN was down for maintenance.As far as playing the games, the biggest change I've encountered is with the DUALSHOCK 4.  They keep pretty much everything that we love, but there are some significant changes.  Gone are the select and start buttons.  That may not sound like a big deal, but it gets confusing when playing a game you are familiar with.  My thumbs kept going to a start button that wasn't there to pause the game, or to the missing select button to pull up a map.  Sony has moved those functions to the touchpad located on top of the controller.  Then there are the new &#34;share&#34; and &#34;options&#34; buttons.  The &#34;share&#34; button allows you to take a photo of your screen or a 15 minute video.  You can also broadcast your gameplay.  I've done the photo upload and it worked great, but have yet to try the other share features.  The options button was used various times throughout menus and the game.  It seems to be a catch all type of thing for many different maintenance functions.  You will also notice  a light on the front of the controller that lights up blue by default.  It is supposed to be used with the Playstation 4 camera to track movement, but can also change colors depending on what is happening in the game.  I don't have a Playstation Camera right now so haven't seen how it interacts with that, but I can tell you the light is distracting in the dark.  I could see it reflected in my screen and it was annoying.  The last big change to the controller is battery life.  With the PS3, charging my controller was an afterthought.  The battery would last somewhere around 30 hours.  With the DUALSHOCK 4, it's more like 6 hours.  That is a HUGE change that I bet most people don't know about.  I was shocked to see that I had to charge my controller on Sunday after a weekend of playing for a couple of hours each day.  The good news is that you can charge the controller at night by plugging it into the PS4 while it is powered down, something you couldn't do with the PS3.  Also, the DUALSHOCK 4 uses a micro USB instead of a Mini USB so your DUALSHOCK 3 cables will not work.  I've already found several cheap cables here on Amazon that I am going to try that are 10 feet in length."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0950176864862442, 0.05356905609369278, 0.16877858340740204, 0.11237962543964386, 0.0006188467959873378, 0.022671453654766083, 0.059628311544656754, 0.07086436450481415, 0.07340417802333832, 0.05450229346752167, 0.03835795447230339, 0.044101640582084656, 0.12726514041423798, 0.07386691123247147, 0.004973901901394129]]}
