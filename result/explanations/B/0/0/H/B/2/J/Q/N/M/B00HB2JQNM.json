I've never found anything that does more for my skin and I'm a product junkie who tries tons of new things all the time.I've been using Olay Total Effects 7 in One Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment and using it in the daytime under my Cotz Plus Sunscreen in the daytime.So when I saw this available I grabbed it. It has the same great properties for my skin the night cream has, plus 30 SPF sunscreen.This has no scent. I love the pump bottle, which is so sensitive you can control exactly how much comes out. This spreads so I need about a pea sized drop for my entire face.I wash this off in late afternoon and see the same clear smooth even toned glow that the night cream gives me. My skin loves this cream. And it doesn't give me the greyish-white pallor the Cotz with titanium gives. Plus the Cotz has turned to a rancid oil halfway through the tube.This is non greasy and after about fifteen minutes I can't feel it on my skin. It does moisturize a bit. And it is the one, and only cream along with it's partner the night cream that actually improves my skin noticeably. My skin tone is evened out. It is smooth and hydrated. Pores are smaller. And as long as I exfoliate every other day, my skin glows. No other cream I've tried and that includes expensive ones does for my skin what this does.edit: This is a whitish cream that takes a few minutes after application to sink in. It does seem like a sunscreen cream more than a moisturizer and it won't let my white skin burn at all even in hours of direct Florida sun. But it does improve my skin. I use this on my chest area and backs of my hands as well as my face.And forget those gimmicky BB creams. Yuck. I've tried several and they make my skin into a greasy oil slick smeared with runny foundation mixed in. Now my skin looks good enough to skip foundation completely.I'm sold on any Olay creams I've tried. There is a good reason this one has been around for so long when most face cream disappear quickly from store shelves, never to be seen again. This works better than any of them.", "I was able to use this moisturizer with sunscreen on my trip to the beach. Four days in the sun and no burn and my skin looks great!", "Received this item selection via Amazon Vine Program.Based upon using it for a short time, it appeared to work on face and hands during early Spring walks.It does seem confusing...as it is not touted specifically for Moisturizer OR Sunscreen...would imagine it could also be used under makeup.It does smell more like a light sunscreen.  Instructions are to reapply after 2 hours.A member of our family has very delicate arm skin due to medication side effects.  Using this sunscreen, the skin has gotten smoother, less inclined to abrasions...the best tried!Additionally, I am finding it works well for my own needs.", "Is this a moisturizer with sunscreen or a sunscreen with moisturizer? I wasn't sure. The drug facts and directions make it clear it is a sunscreen which should be reapplied every two hours. I am not accustomed to using moisturizer that frequently so I called customer service. They told me that it was a moisturizer with sunscreen and the package reads the way it does due to FDA regulations regarding sunscreen.So I pumped some of the thick, white cream out of the container and applied it. It goes on smoothly but has a fragrance that reminded me of baby shampoo. It did linger but was not overwhelming although I prefer unscented products.I think this is a terrific sunscreen with its generous SPF 30. However it failed as a moisturizer. My skin actually felt drier than before. Nor did I observe improvement in the remaining six of seven signs of aging. The expiration date on my container was 09/2015.Olay generally makes good skin care products. I did like the consistency and the high SPF. The pump bottle is cute, a bit chubby but still appealingly modern. It protects the product from contamination which is a definite plus. But for whatever reason, my skin appears to be resistant to its moisturizing properties. That makes it a no for me.", "When my bottle of &#34;Olay Total Effects 7 in 1 moisturizer with anti-aging moisturizer and with 30 SPF sunscreen&#34; runs out, I plan to buy more.The lotion is not so thick that you feel a film on your face all day, nor too thin to feel that it is doing nothing.  I like that sunscreen is  built right into the daily moisturizer because you don't need to remember to apply a separate product when you're out doing yard work or headed to the water, because all too it's too late and the burn and damage is done before you remember that you didn't put on any sunscreen.  I am bad about wearing sunscreen, but this makes it effortless.I like the compact size it comes in (1.7 fl oz) since it could be packed in carry on luggage, in a beach bag, or purse.A little of the product goes a long way, so a small bottle is not negative.5 stars", "It seems cruel that I would be interested in an anti aging moisturizer, and yet still have to worry about breakouts, but I do.I only had to use this for one day to pay the price. It is VERY heavy for a moisturizer, and I knew I should have washed it off immediately. (I know my face well!) A couple of days later, my face had broken out worse than it had in years. If you do still try this moisturizer, I'd recommend setting it aside for a week when you don't have pictures planned!)On another note: I also have VERY sensitive skin, and I typically don't experiment too much when it comes to face products. A few months back, I was using a foundation that burned a bit when I put it on. I didn't think too much at the time, and kept using it. I ended up with a pretty bad case of hives that took a while to get rid of. Not pretty! When I put this moisturizer on, it burned a bit around my nose. (I'm *not* talking severe burning, by any means!) It was enough that I knew I'd just have to throw a whole bottle of moisturizer away, though. based on my past experience.Overall, if you have sensitive skin or skin that is prone to breakouts, I'd pass this product up! (My favorite moisturizer is Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer for Sensitive Skin(SPF 15)). (I've also had a great experience with Simple Moisturizer.)", "For a very thick sunscreen I was pleasantly surprised at how well it absorbed. Although, it still left a shine on my face so I applied some loose powder afterwards. The smell is faint but still has that same old scent. Not refreshing like the new Fresh Effects line. After a week my face seemed a little dryer even though it's also a moisturizer. I guess it's the sunscreen that caused this, I don't know. Happy about the SPF so I'll keep using it and see if it improves my skin or not.", "Another Fabulous Product from Olay.  I've used Total Effects for about a decade now.  It's still around, and the brand is still going strong.  Why?  Because it contains the ingredient niacinamide, which is now ranked way up there with Retin A, the gold standard in skin care.  So glad to see my old favorite SPF 15 is now available in an SPF 30 version.  This product protects from the sun and gets rid of wrinkles, as well as promotes skin elasticity.  Yes, you heard me right.  Google the studies.  They are there.So glad I was able to get in on this product as an Amazon Vine reviewer,  Thank you Amazon Vine!  Another winner from Olay.", "I am a big fan of Olay products.  I particularly like the Olay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream, and use it morning and night.  I was interested in trying this moisturizer, because it has sunscreen, which the other product does not.This product does moisturize well, and I *think* the sunscreen is effective.  But this product feels slightly gritty on my face.  It's like a very light exfoliating sensation.  I don't like that at all.

I love the broad-spectrum SPF and the fact that it's a pump, rather than a bottle or a jar.  No waste, no germs.  Another reviewer remarked that the bottle is chunky, but I like that it doesn't get lost in the shuffle of other jars and bottles.  Too early in the year to tell how effective the SPF is, but so far the texture is good and non-oily.  Let's see now if it breaks me out... No break outs yet, but it's early days.  I'll update my review as I know more.", "Most of my facial skin care products are from Olay because they are both high quality and affordable.  Although $13 an ounce (current price) sounds high, this bottle will last for three months.According to Paula Begoun, a skin care expert, &#34;The formula also contains a couple of good antioxidants. While overall not as state-of-the-art as similar products from Olay's Regenerist collection, this is still a good option for normal to oily skin.&#34;The lotion goes far and you only need a very small amount to cover your face.  My normal skin absorbs it in five minutes and it leaves no noticeable shine.It's hard for me to discern the effects of this product from the others I use since I have used a variety of Olay products for years now.  I find that Olay's Wrinkle Revolution Complex feels silkier but it has no sunscreen and requires about three times as much to cover my skin.  And Olay's Daily Regenerating Serum is a must have (but, again no sunscreen).My dermatologist advices me to use skin care products with no sunscreen and to apply pure sunscreen on top but I get weary of layering.  So I think combining the two for my lazy self is a smart move.", "I generally apply a moisturizer on my face twice a day. This says it's an All in One, which sounds fantastic, and who wouldn't like SPF 30 to boot? You'll go through the product pretty fast if you apply it every 2 hours as suggested.But after using this product for 3 days (twice a day) I noticed that my skin wasn't doing as well--my skin had a more uneven texture (slightly bumpy) and was somewhat drier--and I switched back to the home party product I had been using. And no, I hadn't been out in the sun.This appears to be more sunscreen than moisturizer. Even when putting it in you can see it on your skin if you hadn't rubbed it in enough - and isn't that something you want to avoid?I'm glad other people are having a good experience with it, but based on my experience, I'd be cautious about recommending it. I have had good luck with Olay products in the past, but it's been awhile since I'd used them.", "I love that this one has SPF 30 - most moisturizers are around SPF 15 or 20, and you really need all the sun protection you can get. Love the thickness of this moisturizer, it gets absorbed so very nicely into my skin, and the price is excellent. I have found that after applying this, my makeup stays on longer and goes on more smoothly. This was my second purchase of this particular item, I love it that much. Protect your skin and always wear sunscreen, ladies.", "I received this Olay Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF 30 and had every intention of using it until I read the warnings: &#34;do not use on damaged or broken skin,&#34; &#34;keep out of eyes&#34;, &#34;stop use and ask a doctor if rash occurs.&#34;  I Have very delicate skin and have been using a moisturizer with a SPF 15 factor for years without a problem. I do not like to use products that have been tested on animals and unfortunately this product, from Proctor & Gamble, claims &#34;Dermatologically Tested&#34; on its label. This is not in keeping with my eschewing products that have been tested on laboratory animals and I am therefore highly displeased with Olay.", "This is a non-scented thick lotion which is conveniently dispensed from a pump.  I noticed after application this product leaves you with a slight shimmer or glow, making your skin look radiant.  It's slightly greasy for awhile (about an hour), but after it soaks into your skin, you can apply makeup on top of it just like usual.  I apply it directly after a shower, then I fix my hair and get dressed and by the time I'm ready for makeup, it's soaked in.  A little goes a long way and this size will last quite some time.  I like the fact that it has a generous SPF15, so here in Arizona that is a huge plus!  After using for a month, I didn't notice any negative breakouts or pore clogs which sometimes are a problem for my sensitive skin.  The small size and convenient lid make it easy to throw in a beach bag or purse when you're on-the-go.", "I absolutely love this product and will definitely buy more when I run out. First of all I am 66 years old and my skin is lizard dry and wrinkled. I have been using the OLay Total Effects moisturizer and within a week notice less wrinkles and much smoother skin. It is excellent that it is also SPF 30 since I live in the southwest where the sun is quite strong every day. I have used moisturizers in the past and some make my skin feel oily and I end up washing it off.  This Olay product feels so good with no oily feeling. and I just really love it. It is perfect.", "I often spend hours outside and sometimes don't know it's going to happen so this is nice for using every morning.  It doesn't run in my eyes if I perspire, and doesn't sting.  So far I haven't had any burning with this product but of course we haven't had much sun yet this year.", "I like this stuff. I've waited to review it so I can see if it has any affect on the way I look. One thing that happened that I didn't like is that sometimes it stings when I put it on. This could be unique to me. I am not sure. I haven't seen a huge difference but I do think there is a slight improvement in my skin's appearance. I think it is a good thing.", "This feels really rich when you put in on and absorbs fast and your skin feels healthy. I have yet to try putting on makeup over this as I really only go out to see the doctor, so I have not tried that yet. but when I do go out I feel comfortable my skin is protected with the SPF 30. I have used anti-aging products from Olay for years so I don't have many lines to begin with, and I'm not a sun worshiper, but I have noticed what lines I do have appear smoother. I don't expect a miracle in a bottle anyway. Healthy living like eating right, drinking a lot of water, lots of sunblock and no smoking is the key to preventing deep wrinkles in addition to caring for your skin, Products from Olay is a no brainer.", "The Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer does a very good job of moisturizing ash well as protecting from sun damage.  It goes on very smoothly and blocks the sun's rays as well.

A very silky texture that glides over skin and quickly disappears, into my fair/medium toned skin -- leaving behind a satin-like, matte, finish. I have no idea how it looks on darker skin tones. No sticky or tacky residue left behind. The oil free aspect is a major plus, if ya know what I mean.The light floral scent quickly dissipates, so one does not continually smell it all day. :) The container is very nice:  a very sturdy plastic -- short and stout, with a nice lock down *audible click when closed* cover lid.  This makes Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer With SPF 30, a perfect portable must-have...just throw it in a beach bag, backpack, suitcase or purse...  The dispenser button is notable because it has a smooth hollowed out section where one's fore finger rests to press and dispense just the right amount of Anti-Aging Moisturizer.

I first began using Olay for my face when I was 18 and have loved it over the (30 or so) years in it's various types. Getting this new one with SPF 30 was a bonus, or so I thought.Turns out that it behaves much more like a sunscreen than a daily face lotion. I can't honestly report on the long term effects because I could not use it for more than a week and went back to my Aveeno Active Naturals Anti-aging (which is very similar in the &#34;promises&#34; it offers). The reason? The Olay is very thick, a bit greasy, a tad grainy feeling and left my face a little too shiny under makeup. I also ended up breaking out, which is a rarity for me.I'm sure it has all the wonderful properties that Olay is famous for, but in the effort to become more sun friendly, it just is not the one for me. Perhaps if you are prone to dry skin, it may be better suited to you.", "I love this product. It is lightly scented and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I'm not a fan of the pump design, because product tends to harden in the little tube. Still, it's a great product at a reasonable price.", "\"For reasons completely unknown to me, I have NO allergies to ANY product....south of my neck. LOL But, on both my face and scalp, if I don't use the right products in those areas that my skin demands, there's \"\"heck\"\" to pay! Break-outs, scabs, puffiness and swelling are the usual reactions so I'm uber-careful with what shampoos and facial products I can use.For decades, the two skin moisturizers that I tolerate are all Olay products (currently use Total Effects 7) and Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion. Neither produce blackheads or puffiness so it's what I stick with.Now, something you need to know: I wash my face between 10 and 20 times per day!!! WHY? Because I'm a landscape architect and throughout a typical 8-10 hour day, I will be covered with sawdust from tree trimming, soil, manure!, and anything else that someone working outside for a living comes in contact with. So, whenever I'm done with a job, I either have the luxury of washing my face inside the client's home or...via the water from a hose.Because of the constant and necessary washings to remove debris from my skin and what gets into my eyes, my skin during the cold weather is raw and chapped. Not even the listed Olay or Clinique lotions do much for me: yeah, they make my skin smooth with first application but it's either sweated off or washed off by 10:00 am.THIS is the first lotion that stays in place!!! I admit it: it's one pricey bugger, to be sure! And, if I wasn't able to try it via Vine, I honestly doubt I ever would have bought it to try out with my weird work conditions. But, the effects were immediate on my skin and I'm loving it!Of note: with my 1st application, there was some *tingling* on my skin that lasted an hour and had me go \"\"Oh-Oh! Here come the hives!\"\", but it didn't amount to anything. On my 2nd application and sequential ones, there was NO REACTION whatsoever. It is a thick-thick moisturizer: I only need the smallest amount to smooth over my entire face. And the BEST thing about this particular one: IT DOES NOT SWEAT OFF!!!! With the other two lotions I've mentioned, with the slightest of sweats, they begin to drip into my eyes, stinging them so severely that I can't wait to wash them off! Not THIS lotion! It stayed in place the entire rainy day we were trimming 12 crabapple trees and despite repeated face washings, I could still feel a residual amount on my skin.Where both beloved moisturizers I listed always make me feel like I'm wearing a mask, I do NOT get the feeling at all from THIS product! Normally, when I wear makeup, I'll use the Olay or Clinique lotions and by night's end, I'm clawing at the clammy feeling on my skin and run to the bathroom to wash them off before even changing out of my good clothes. With this one, once I was home, I changed from work to leisure clothes, took a shower and reapplied this lotion...just because of both how good it felt but also how nice it made my saggy old skin look! LOLI'm sold! I guess to afford this I'll have to do a few less drive-thru's for designer coffee drinks but hey, \"\"I'm worth it!\"\" :D VERY pleased and VERY happy with this Olay Anti-Aging moisturizer!!!\"", "The Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Moisturizer with SPF 30 is an excellent moisturizer. I found my skin feels smooth and clean. No grainy substance as posted in one review.

However, I can say that it does provide nourishing moisturization. The protection against sun damage is questionable. Once you have applied make-up over this moisturizer, does the sun protection still apply? According to dermatologists, you need to apply sun screen lotion or cream under the moisturizer for a good effect. And, the directions say to apply every two hours if going into the sun.This moisturizer has a pump effect which is appreciated. The moisturizer has a very slight scent that I like. Heavy or even light perfume scented moisturizers are a real turn off for me. I like the scent, the fact that the moisturizer does leave my skin feeling smooth. I did inadvertently get a small amount into my eye, and even though I rinsed it thoroughly with water several times, it did leave an irritating feeling for 30 minutes or so. The next day my eyes were fine.

However, the strong fragrance keeps me from using it as often as I'd like.  I've been using the Olay night cream and the Olay microsculpting cream, so I wasn't expecting Olay total effects to be much different in scent.  I'm generally not sensitive to a lot of odors, but this scent is pretty strong...thankfully the scent dissipates after 20 minutes or so.The dispenser pump is pretty good so you don't go overboard with how much you apply.  I've not noticed much of a difference in my skin since using this, but I've mostly just used this under makeup or alone when I go out during the day for the SPF feature.  It is a decent moisturizer, but it will not serve as a replacement for my night cream.", "I love Olay products, especially their face cleansers and lotions. Unfortunately, this product seems to be more sunblock than lotion. The texture is very dense and applies very thick, not like a lotion. At first, I thought this was just a more intense moisturizer, but after continued use, my skin is no less dry. And the product instructions state to apply every 2 hours with continued sun exposure. There's no way I'd use it that often unless I was at the beach, and if then, the amount in the container is so small, you'd quickly run out. And the price is ridiculous for simple Sunblock with little noticeable moisturizer.", "I'm not an intensive user of beauty products, so I don't have a lot of them to compare in my home.  However, this compact dispenser container of moisturizer is quite simple to add in and seems to be nicely effective as a moisturizer.The consistency is creamy, but dense so that a little goes a long way, and it dispenses without any issue of drips.  The simple push dispenser is easy to operate and the container simple to store.  While I can't really give any anti-aging definites, my skin stays soft and hydrated all day--and I'm prone to dry skin as a rule.  A lot of products tend to cause an allergic reaction, or else just sit uncomfortably on the skin--this easily blends in and does not cause any averse reactions or itching.  The SPF 30 is a real plus with the summer just starting.There's no real scent to the moisturizer so it should be fine to use if you're sensitive to odors and don't like them, or if you prefer to add a scent of your own afterwards.  I've no complaints about this product whatsoever.  I only avoid 5 stars because I really can't attest to any kind of anti-aging claim with the little I've used this moisturizer.^_^ Shanshad", "Let me preface my review by saying that I am a long-time Olay customer (decades). In fact, I wear two Olay products daily (Olay Complete and Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum). It is disappointing, then, to give an Olay product 2 stars.For years, I used an earlier fragrance-free version of this Olay Total Effects anti-aging moisturizer (Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Fragrance Free Moisturizer 1.7 Fl Oz). I loved that version and only stopped using it because I stopped being able to find it in my local stores. I gave that version 4 stars when I reviewed it on September 5, 2009. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that, while I loved it as a moisturizer, I saw little benefit to my skin besides great moisturization (it had the same anti-aging claims as this product).Jump ahead to 2014: I was offered this new version of Total Effects for review and was THRILLED! I had expectations that it would be at least as good as the version I reviewed in 2009. WRONG!My primary complaints:1) The very first time I opened the package to try the lotion, the entire top of the dispenser (the pump portion) came off in my hand when I popped off the cap. This is NOT supposed to happen. In YEARS of using the previous version, I NEVER saw it happen.2) Perhaps the jar I received is defective (I'm shocked not to hear many other reviewers talk about this), but the lotion I received is so gritty that I was unable to use it over the long term. It just felt disgusting on my skin...like I was putting on sunscreen at the beach with sand on my hands. AWFUL!3) There is fragrance in this version, and while it is not awful, it is still too perfumey for me (I am fragrance sensitive).4) While the previous version of this lotion felt wonderfully hydrating and comforting to my super dry skin, THIS version feels heavy--greasy. I did not find it comforting or hydrating to my dry skin. It just felt like a mask.5) Considering that I was accustomed to using this same style of pump for years, the pressure needed to get lotion to come out of this packaging seems excessive. So much so that I found it difficult to get lotion to come out just using one hand. Putting lotion on in the morning is almost automatic to me, so to have to WORK to get lotion out is unacceptable.The ONLY plus I can give this version of Total Effects is that it not only contains an SPF of 30, but it is a broad spectrum SPF, which is excellent.If Olay wants to send me another package to try, I'd be happy to give it one more try because I believe in the Olay product line, but I absolutely would NOT purchase this moisturizer again based on the experience I had with the package I received.2 stars - Not recommended.", "The great thing about this product is that it delivers a combination of skin solutions that include anti-aging, moisturizing and sunblock all in one neatly formulated formula. The price is great and so is the overall experience. Highly recommended.", "I like Olay products - they seem to be some of the best drugstore options.  This moisturizer made my skin feel soothed and moisturized, but not greasy.  I've only used it a few weeks, so difficult to tell the long term benefits- such as disappearance of fine lines (though it has seemed to tackle them). One odd thing I noticed, it feel slightly gritty when I put it on-  its almost like there are tiny beads in it, but they vanish after putting on my skin.
