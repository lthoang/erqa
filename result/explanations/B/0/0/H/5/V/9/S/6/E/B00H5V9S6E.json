I was unable to put the controller down.", "\"Holy macaroni... what a vivid, imaginative, and colorful universe this limbless fellow lives in!I was a huge fan of Rayman Origins, which was released two years ago. At that time, I considered it to be the best 2D platformer in the history of gaming, and I believe that has remained true - until now. Ubisoft has done gamers everywhere a huge service by improving upon their remarkable formula in every possible way, and delivering a game that's even BETTER than the awesome platformer that is Origins.Foremost, the visuals of Legends need to be addressed. One of the best things about Origins was that it looked like you were controlling a cartoon, which resulted in terrific animations, slapstick comedy, bizarre spectacles, and OODLES of SMILES. I would have been perfectly happy if this sequel looked exactly like Origins, but somehow the developers have made it look even better. The graphics in this game POP like nothing I've ever seen before, and it looks even more like an animated movie than ever. Graphics generally have little to do with actual gameplay, but in the case of the Rayman games, their whimsical presentation has a direct correlation with the end result (that being fun, laughter, and wonder), so they do have a big impact here. This game is a visual treat, and I predict that it will be impervious to the \"\"aging\"\" that most games suffer from, because the art direction is so marvelously realized.Though Legends' graphics may make this game look a tad childish, do not be deceived - this is a meticulously designed platformer that offers tremendous challenges. Furthermore, if you study the layout of the levels and practice, you will discover that there is an incredible amount of sophistication here. As far as I can tell, EVERY level can be played in one swift movement, with no hesitation whatsoever - if you have the skill to memorize the patterns and the reflexes to guide you (which comes in handy when attempting to complete time challenges). I am blown away by the amount of care that the designers put into this game. I don't see any \"\"shortcuts\"\" or evidence of \"\"going through the motions\"\" to fill out content.And on the subject of content, there is a staggering amount here. The campaign alone is very long, particularly for a 2D platformer, but what makes the game infinitely larger is the amount of additional challenges and collectibles. Multiplayer is also a blast, and I can have fun playing Legends with less experienced gamers. Though it is far harder to complete challenges when I have other gamers along for the ride, that's not what it's about - it's about having fun and watching Rayman and Globox slap each other silly.It bears mentioning that you can have anybody play this game with you, from a five-year-old to your granny. There is no violence other than the \"\"cartoon\"\" variety, and it's a huge departure from the glut of ultra-violent titles that have saturated the market in recent years. To me, this is a wonderful, beautiful break from the norm. No longer do you have to worry about \"\"headshots\"\" and the other staples of the shooter genre, but you can focus on the types of things that made us enjoy games when we were younger: a sense of wonder, whimsy, and the relentless pursuit of fun.If you want to BOOST this game on PSN, please send me a friend request (my PSN ID is WhiskeyBean). There is one trophy that is particularly difficult to get, and you need to have PSN friends playing it and competing on the Daily/Weekly Challenges. The challenges are really fun and only take a few minutes a day, and you will also have to do the challenges to reach the last level of \"\"awesomeness\"\", which unlocks another difficult trophy. All Rayman players are welcome to seek me out... thanks!\"", "Amazing, colorful, lengthy, perfect in almost every way possible.Every gamer needs to add this to their gaming collection - UBIsoft really knows how to delivery on sequels. Rayman Origins was great, Legends is simply legendary.I know this may get discredit, but I find Rayman Legends better than any Mario sidescroller hands down. So much more colorful, much better art, much more things to collect, value is so much greater in my opinion.", "My son love it, nice graphics, good history, buy without any question. Price and Quality are very good. GO for it!", "I previously reviewed this product on the PS3 (my original review is copied below) and decided to get it on the PS4.  For those of you who have it on the PS3 and are wondering if you want to get it on the PS4, is it worth the change?The quick answer is no.  You won't see any enhancements or graphical upgrades or functional differences between the 2 versions.  The only significant advantage that I can report on is that the load times are considerably snappier on the more powerful platform.  That said, Rayman Legends is still eye-candy and the animation is simply stunning regardless of which console you get it on.If you were on the fence before and haven't picked it up yet, picking it up at its release price of just under 40 dollars is well worth it and you should read my original review below.[Original Review From PS3 Version]My daughter and I are quite familiar with platformers in general. In fact, we have been a daddy-daughter team ever since she first played with me on Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2. We have also played Super Mario Bros. Wii and others as well.When I first picked up Rayman Origins (which precedes this title), I knew very little about Rayman in general. I picked up Rayman Origins for $19.99 as a Xmas present. Little did I know what a hit it would be with BOTH of us.Rayman Legends follows in the same vein as our main, limbless protagonist, Rayman, is once again awakened to rescue the lumas and teensies from the denizens of a multitude of evil characters. Rayman will need to jump, sprint, &#34;float&#34; (his ears will whip around like a helicopter), and punch his way to victory. What makes the game even more fun is the ability to have up to 4 people play co-op at the same time, albeit only on the same console. It's still sad that online support is inexplicably absent and it would have certainly encouraged other family members in other cities to purchase it and join in on the fun. However, it's still an absolute blast.If you loved Rayman Origins, Rayman Legends will stagger you. The sheer volume of unlockable content that is available will ensure the longevity of this title, especially for completionists like me. However, like Origins, if you're into it just to beat the &#34;main storyline&#34;, so to speak, the game does cater to that level of satisfaction for those of use who don't have the cat-like alacrity to nail every jump perfectly. It's a game that can be enjoyed from both beginners to experts alike, and comical for all.Special mention should be made to the art direction and music. Rayman Origins had beautiful visuals and Legends (despite being released almost on the heels of Origins) does not fail to disappoint either; I'd almost say that it exceeds Origins if it were possible. I love how level design has moved away from an almost Mario-like stage progression map to a gallery of artwork that your character(s) hop into to get to the levels that you'll play. The music fits the level designs perfectly and the cartoon-like artwork in each level is extremely fluid with no discernible framerate hiccups. It's flawless as a platformer could possibly get and I can't spot a single element in this game that didn't appear to have a great deal of love and attention. The same goes for the level design - everything that can be unlocked in the game is achievable without a single item feeling like a &#34;cheat&#34;. Truthfully, some areas require a significant amount of skill, but it's skill nonetheless--not poor level design--that will be your only hindrance for getting EVERYTHING.Rayman Legends is one of the few platformers out there that are worthy of the full MSRP release value. While the online component is still sadly missing, there is still plenty of side-splitting, couch-sharing fun to be had here.", "Controls - 9/10 Good control-abilityCamera Angles - 10/10 No issues with games camera anglesGraphics - 7/10 The graphics are good but could be betterAudio - 9/10 This game has some great music!Redundancy - 7/10 It is a bit redundantDifficulty - 4/10Story - 5/10Online Play - Challenge your friends.Overall Game Play - 5/10This is a good game and can be very challenging if you are trying to find all of the little smurf like people and earn all of the trophies but those of you not into exploring can run through with minimal exploration. This just was not my style of game. I tried it because of the lack of games out for the new consoles but I lost interest in it very quickly.*It is one of the few family appropriate games.", "This review is from: Rayman Legends - PlayStation 4 Standard Edition (Video Game)With Rayman Origins setting a new standard for everyone's favourite French hero, and rubbing shoulders with the leaders in the platforming genre, Michel Ancel's long overdue sequel has a lot to live up to. Fortunately, Rayman Legends is a tremendously fun and brilliantly designed title that is the very definition of a must-have for fans of the hop-heavy genre.The release takes Origins' fundamentals and polishes them to within an inch of their life. The controls are as tight as ever, allowing you to run, jump, swim, swing, and glide through the environments so smoothly that it's as if you're not really controlling your character at all, but working on instinct and manipulating the action with your mind. Levels are so meticulously detailed that you'll be blown be away by their delicious visuals, charmed by their impediments, and delighted once you master their unique challenges. And through all of these emotions, a stunning score will add peaks to your enjoyment, driving your adrenaline through difficult stages, and calming your blood pressure as you explore. This is a game that masterfully links each individual part of its makeup into an exquisite whole, culminating in a true sensory treat.While its predecessor was fairly narrative-driven, Legends puts much of its focus on content. Rayman and his friends are awoken a century after the events of Origins to find the Teensies &#8211; peculiar wizard fellows &#8211; have been captured by Dark Teensies, and the Glade of Dreams has been overrun with demons and monstrosities. It's up to the limbless hero and his friends to save the land and retrieve the mythical creatures. Of course, this rescue mission provides loose context for a slew of different environmental themes, spanning castles, lush jungles, dank swamps, and more. You even get to explore under the sea, and the fiery horrors of a nightmarish kitchen. There's an unbelievable amount of variety &#8211; with many of the best levels from Ubisoft Montpellier's previous adventure revisited for good measure.It's not just a question of visual variety either. While precision platforming is certainly the order of the day &#8211; demanding impeccable timing and focus &#8211; it's augmented with stealth sections, boss battles, and more. The sheer number of ideas on display prevents the action from ever outstaying its welcome, with even minor minigames such as Kung Foot &#8211; a competitive multiplayer mode where two teams battle it out trying to score goals by jumping and attacking the ball &#8211; bringing hours of entertainment. However, it's the music levels that truly take the crown. Featuring a Rayman remix of a classic song, these stages push you to the right while a backing track plays, with your jumps, attacks, and general interactions overlaying accompanying melodies. It literally results in a symphony that's written in gameplay, which is perhaps the biggest compliment that you could possibly pay such an imaginative set of levels.While you'll need focus to beat the main campaign, adding three other players to the action via drop-in/drop-out co-op brings a chaotic dynamic to the affair. Multiplayer is a barrel of laughs and negates the challenge a touch, with death resulting in your character blowing up like balloon, waiting to be tagged back into play with a slap from one of your team mates. However, it can get confusing with so many players on screen, and detracts ever so slightly from the pure presentational treat that you'll derive from the single player mode. It's not bad, it's just different &#8211; and it's a testament to the quality of the title's design that it manages to appeal in both options. I enjoyed exploring the levels alone first, and then returning with friends to gobble up Lums, where standing on each others' shoulders makes it easier to reach those high hanging goodies.Adding buddies to the mix is also useful for handling the duties of Murphy, a floating frog-type fellow who aids you occassionally in levels by interacting with the environment. In single player, once Murphy appears, he'll automatically fly over to the next object that he can interact with, including platforms, enemies, and ropes. This mechanic is a remnant from the game's original Nintendo Wii U exclusive days, where the Gamepad's touch screen is used to navigate the amphibian, while the computer takes control of Rayman. Here on the PS3, the automated solution works fairly well. You don't have the accuracy that you would with the Gamepad, but you don't lose control of the main character. However, it doesn't always flow; the pace of the game can reach such speeds that using Murphy is unwieldy. Fortunately, another player can take control of the sidekick in multiplayer, allowing everyone else to concentrate on surviving the stage.With six worlds, oodles of collectibles, co-op, re-mastered stages, and more, Rayman Legends is absolutely bursting with content. It can feel a little overwhelming at first, but once you start freeing Teensies and opening up the game, it's hard not to want to sample everything. Each individual level is packed with its own challenges, including grabbing the aforementioned Lums. These happy-go-lucky organisms unlock scratch cards &#8211; another leftover from the Wii U release &#8211; that you rub away at with the analogue sticks to unlock even more content, including the previously touched upon Rayman Origins stages, as well as creatures which generate more Lums for you to collect.Finally, there are daily and weekly online challenges, which task you to promptly gather up Lums, dash through a level, or survive for as long as possible while something deadly gives chase. Your score is uploaded to the leaderboards, and you're rewarded with tiered trinkets and Lums depending on how well you performed compared to the rest of the community. It can be a little frustrating watching your gold trophy decline as others compete and the score thresholds for the awards adapt, but it's a compelling mode that will pull you in for multiple runs as you attempt to better your score.ConclusionRayman Legends winds up with a fistful of content and scores a knock-out blow with its impressive visuals, infectious audio, and exceptional controls. Some of the Wii U features may struggle to translate, but this game still more than lives up to its name, and is destined for a place among the platforming elite. Chaotic with friends and addictive alone, this will leave you intoxicated by its charm, and with so much to do, it won't outstay its welcome anytime soon.", "This game is so freaking easy you could beat it with your eyes close i dont not recommend also most of the stuff in the game are in other games so you are playing the same stuff as before.
