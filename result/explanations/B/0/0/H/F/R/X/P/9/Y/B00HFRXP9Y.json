Some blue tooth implementations are bad, as in the sound is weak with a lot of noise.  I haven't had many devices drop like some did in the early implementations though.-Water resistant isn't water proof, some sprinkles of rain OK, dropping in the pool I wouldn't expect it to survive-The sound is neither over-whelming nor under whelming.  I think though for what Amazon has it priced at, I think it's worth it and would buy it if this is what I was looking for.  Obviously you can spend hundreds more and get better sound our spend a lot less and get worse sound.  As always it's a price/quality trade-off and I think it's reasonable.-It's bigger than I expected, I think it's fine for home use but it's bulky if you are thinking of taking it to the beach or a picnic BUT you can if you want.  It's just not something you throw in a beach bag cause it's so big it probably won't even fit.-Sound is somewhat directional, walking around it you can tell 'which way it's facing'Again, if you are looking for a bluetooth patio speaker, I think it's a good choice though I wouldn't be leaving it outside at night.", "The iLuv Syrenprowh is impressive. It is a larger bluetooth speaker that serves to give you powerful sound and bass on the go.1) Reasonably good battery life. It can get to 4 hours and some on a full charge.2) Impressive bass. Strong, powerful, clear.3) Solid sound - clear, distinct differentiation of instruments, vocals, sounds, etc. Sounds don't get muddled.I was impressed at how well it handled music and movies with just one speaker. Attractive design. Enjoyable, clear music.Highly recommended.", "I like this speaker. It hooks up to my phone with minimal configuration required, and I can maintain the connection to the speaker with my phone in my pocket as I walk around the house. Though my house is small, I haven't lost the connection yet while inside. The speaker also lasts for a few hours on battery power, which is nice.", "This speaker is marketed as usable for the outdoors.  Since it is bluetooth, it's compatible with any number of devices, so there is no limit to the amount of music playable on the speaker (limited really to whatever you have on your tablet or phone).A bit of a technical discussionThe speaker is fairly large compared to many portable bluetooth speakers, but it is small enough to fit in the corner of your trunk if you wanted something for a picnic.  The size also helps a bit with projecting the sound, but not significantly (and it should be pointed out that the speaker does allow for directional use (like in the corner of a patio).  The sound quality is consistent with speakers in this price class.  Generally speaking, the base is a bit limited, but the music is clear and does not sound overly tinny for any of the musics that I've tried on the speaker.  To evaluate the speaker, I played rock, jazz, blues, and classical.  For music with a &#34;full sound&#34;, one might be a bit disappointed, but you'll have to leave this price point to do better.  Also, very notably, the music does not sound crackly.  This means that the amplification internal to the speaker is a good design, uses good parts, and probably will suit the needs of most reasonably discerning listeners.The speaker is rechargeable, so this in itself is going to limit the maximum sound output.  So, the listening area is going to be about the size of a normal patio, and effective only if there isn't significant other background noise.  So, it may not be great for something noisy like the beach, but in all honesty, not much is that runs on batteries or is rechargeable.  Also, the speaker can be paired with another for stereo (other speaker sold separately).  I didn't evaluate the speaker for this capability, but I have found some problems with this feature in the past with other speakers.A bit on the use of the speaker ...The controls for the speaker are accessible and easy to use.  I had no trouble connecting via bluetooth to the speaker (with my Android tablet), and have found that in general other Android devices such as my phone work equally well.  The weight of the speaker is not excessive (something around 1 pound) and easy to carry around.  My own plan is to use this as an outdoor speaker, but only the test of time will determine if the speaker holds up under weather conditions.The iLuv brand has captured a fairly large portion of the market for household items speakers, clock radios, listening devices, and other common items.  I put them towards the middle of the market in terms of quality and price.", "Design/Function:  I have really enjoyed using the Iluv Syren Pro thus far.  To begin, the device is about 12 inches tall and weighs about 2 pounds.  It has a stylish design with a solid build.  Nothing on the device feels cheap.  The device allows auxiliary input as well as Bluetooth and multiple devices can be paired to one source allowing for stereo sound, a very nice option.  The device can be used ac/dc and it holds a charge for about eight hours, which makes it truly portable.  I have not tested the device in poor weather, so I cannot speak to its performance as a &#34;weather resistant&#34; device.  We love to spend time at the pool/beach and it brings piece of mind that the housing protects the speaker from water.  The top mounted music control is simple and works well.Connectivity:  Connectivity was a breeze.  I used an android smartphone and tablet and both connected instantly.  The verbal confirmation is clear and immediate.  Once connected, reconnect is automatic, which I've not experienced with every Bluetooth enabled device I have used in the past.Sound quality:  The sound quality is very good and the Syren Pro gets quite loud for what it is.  The sound is not at all &#34;crackly&#34;, but the volume could be a little higher to make it better for outdoor use (phone was turned all the way up).  With that being said, it compares well to other devices in terms of clarity and volume, particularly for a battery-powered speaker.Summary:  I couldn't be happier with the device.  The price point seems fair and, depending on your needs/room size, it should serve most fairly well.  Don't expect to fill an acre yard with sound, but if you want something with some good kick for your patio or living room this is a great option.", "I got one of these free from Vine, and was pleased enough to buy a second. This enabled me to test the stereo bluetooth linkage between the two speakers, which is simple and straightforward and works as advertised. Simply assign one speaker to right channel, the other to left, and hit the pairing buttons on both and they will link. Besides linking to each other, the speakers synch easily with my iPhone, iPad and Blackberry devices.Although somewhat larger than one might expect in the trend toward ever-smaller speakers, these reward you with rich, smooth sound that is every bit as good as I will ever need. They are lightweight enough to be clearly portable and fit to set outside during a garden party. They are advertised as weather resistant, and I believe it, although of course I would not leave them out during a monsoon.Battery life is good for about 8 hours, and they also come with AC adapters to run off house current. All in all a very capable and adaptable set of speakers for your bluetooth devices.", "I LOVE my iLuv.  It's a good looking speaker that sounds excellent.1)  Everything about the iLuv is stylish, down to the packaging materials and manual.  It is tall and has a substantial footprint, so make sure you have enough space for it.  It is sturdily constructed and made of fingerprint proof white plastic that is easy to clean.  A convenient hand-hold is provided as well.  It can be paired with another iLuv SYRENPROWH to provide left/right stereo options.2)  Pairing via Bluetooth could not have been easier.  Voice controls indicate when a successful pairing has been made.3)  The sound quality is excellent.  I tested it against a rectangular Jabra Solemate MAX, and the iLuv had superior sound.  The vertical design projects sounds more effectively than the Jabra's squat rectangular design.  Bass is surprisingly good as well.4)  I've used it at several parties already and my guests complimented me on the stylish Bluetooth speaker.  Fortunately I've not had to test its water resistant (note, not water proof) claims, but I can more confidently use it at outdoor parties knowing it is weather resistant.Overall, I'm very pleased."], "Gamma": [0.6912713050842285, 0.04264470562338829, 0.0426408015191555, 0.04263950139284134, 0.0426408015191555, 0.0426408015191555, 0.011453960090875626, 0.0414273776113987, 0.0426408015191555], "Beta": [[0.006885459180921316, 0.1715504378080368, 0.44250085949897766, 0.0038983882404863834, 0.34955060482025146, 0.025453602895140648, 0.0001606651785550639], [0.005040234886109829, 0.17748777568340302, 0.42427733540534973, 0.0026659455616027117, 0.34192848205566406, 0.048049166798591614, 0.0005510718328878284], [0.0050401948392391205, 0.17748785018920898, 0.42427682876586914, 0.0026659208815544844, 0.34192824363708496, 0.04804985225200653, 0.0005510874907486141], [0.0050402297638356686, 0.17748798429965973, 0.42427656054496765, 0.0026659443974494934, 0.3419281840324402, 0.04804994910955429, 0.0005510929622687399], [0.0050401948392391205, 0.17748785018920898, 0.42427682876586914, 0.0026659208815544844, 0.34192824363708496, 0.04804985225200653, 0.0005510874907486141], [0.0050401948392391205, 0.17748785018920898, 0.42427682876586914, 0.0026659208815544844, 0.34192824363708496, 0.04804985225200653, 0.0005510874907486141], [0.006378917954862118, 0.18221691250801086, 0.41569995880126953, 0.00298840319737792, 0.33827266097068787, 0.053738102316856384, 0.00070501200389117], [0.005064233206212521, 0.17687377333641052, 0.4244557321071625, 0.0028646430000662804, 0.34217894077301025, 0.048003170639276505, 0.0005594958201982081], [0.0050401948392391205, 0.17748785018920898, 0.42427682876586914, 0.0026659208815544844, 0.34192824363708496, 0.04804985225200653, 0.0005510874907486141]]}
