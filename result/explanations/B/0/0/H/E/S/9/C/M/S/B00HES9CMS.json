The total carbohydrates for 2.5 tbsp is 4g with 4 grams of dietary fiber. If you go by net carbs, that zero net carbs for a delicious, chocolate flavor.It really is delicious and I'm tickled about having an organic, low carb treat.I have tried several items from Viva Labs and they have each been excellent.~ I received a sample product for review.", "There are a lot of things I like about organic cacao.  This is the type of cacao I like and want to have on hand.  No, it doesn&#8217;t have that sweet taste you will find in Nutella, so don&#8217;t expect it.  It has a slightly bitter tang to it, but if you want you can have a Starbucks treat at home by making your own Caff&egrave; Mocha.Mocha Coffee1 tbs Viva Labs cacao powder1 tbs organic sugar (I add to taste)2 tbs. Milk1 cup hot coffeeI have aJura Milk Frotherand added a bit of froth to the top to create that Caff&egrave; Mocha treat.  Very easy and a very delightful drink.  As a matter of fact, I&#8217;m sitting here enjoying it.One other interesting thing about raw cacao powder is the fact that it has theobromine in it.  Well, yes, that will give you energy, but it&#8217;s also a bronchodialator.  If you have asthma or COPD, a couple tablespoons added to your coffee actually helps you breathe better.  I have asthma and it actually helps open up the bronchial tubes more.  I&#8217;m repeating myself here because I&#8217;ve said this about other organic cacaos.Now I&#8217;m not saying this is a substitute for an inhaler, but I&#8217;ve always used this cocoa formula when I need it.  No, this stuff doesn&#8217;t taste like your Nutella or Hersheys, but rather has the taste and bitterness of 80% Lindt chocolate.  Some like it and some don&#8217;t.  I just happen to love it and will continue to buy cacao in its raw form.FEATURES:&#9658;  100% Certified Organic - Viva Labs Cacao is free from pesticides and harmful additives&#9658;  Non-GMO Project Verified - free from any genetic engineering, preserving its full nutrient potential&#9658;  Gluten-Free - suitable for anyone following a gluten-free diet&#9658;  Vegan - contains no animal products or byproducts&#9658;  Source of antioxidants, fiber and magnesium - help to support overall health and well-beingINGREDIENTS:Certified organic raw cacao (Theobroma Cacao)ORIGIN:PeruSample provided for review.", "Apart from being a crazily good deal for the price, this product contains no sugar compared with some other brands and is the 100% pure high quality cacao powder. It tastes great, works well for cooking and is completely organic/non-GMO. The package also reseals easily after opening. For the quality/price combination, this is an excellent choice.", "This stuff is a screaming good deal. It's top-quality cacao with the deep rich flavor of the best beans. I also eat raw cacao nibs and have tried a zillion chocolates and cacao powders for baking and just drinking, and this stuff is at least an A, maybe an A+. Plus it's organic and fair trade, which normally raises the price a bunch. Instead, Viva prices it at only 10 bucks/lb, very very fair when you consider that most cacaos go for 50%  to 100% more, and often are neither organic nor fair trade, which matters once you know how poorly some vendors treat their suppliers in the third world.Viva offers this at the best price you'll find for this quality, clearly making less margin than most firms, but also likely selling way more, so it all evens out. That's intelligent and caring business practice. Which really doers matter. I mix it with their coconut sugar and a pinch of cayenne in almond milk and it's some of the best chocolate milk you will EVER taste. It also bakes up well; I add a bit to bread and it makes a lovely difference. They gave me this as a sample, and once it's gone I'm buying more. Can't offer a higher recommendation than that.This is a great product in every way and is worth 15 bucks easy. At ten it's just a steal. If you like chocolate, and who doesn't, try this out. And if you're into that real chocolate taste, you may just find yourself eating a pinch of this stuff raw on occasion for that magic choco boost.Plus, cacao is VERY HEALTHY, especially without sugar added. All that pleasure and good for you too...at a fair price?Splendid.", "In working with a nutritionist, have learned there are HEALTHY substitutes for the foods we love.  My treat for the day is always an iced coffee mocha.  At Starbucks they are about $4 and 400 calories with their chocolate syrup.  The nutritionist told me about stevia a natural sweetener.  Then I saw this cacao is only 51 calories for 2.5 tbsp. What if you combine them with coffee and milk?To make a delicious low-calorie and healthy iced coffee mocha, I brew a Parisian vanilla coffee the night before (one cup) and put in frig.  Then put in blender about 7 large ice cubes, 1 and 1/2 cups almond milk, 1/2 cup lowfat milk, about 1-2 tsp. of this cacao powder, the coffee, and sweeten to taste with the stevia.  It is delicious and only about 150-200 calories. You can make it with cream or half and half, too, for added richness. Makes 3 cups of liquid coffee mocha to drink during the day.This cacao is tasty and smooth in the iced mocha coffee, and the nutrition can't be beat.  No sugar, no sodium, 23% of magnesium, 16% fiber, and 3g protein. Cacao has almost 8 times the amount of flavonoids as black tea. This products is lowfat and organic, gluten-free and all that jazz.  I had been using cocoa and fairly happy with it, but this has MORE nutrition and is very smooth and tasty. The other cocoa wasn't organic like this product.  This is priced reasonably.  Really, it has everything to recommend it.  Can't imagine a superior product.  I'm ordering more as it's fresh and will keep. The expiration date is a couple of years away.  The company also has a coconut sugar I'm going to try instead of the stevia.It's marvelous to have something that not only is healthy for you, it's low-calorie and is a yummy treat.  That's hard to find in many foods.  Using this cacao powder is a guilt-free way to get your chocolate treat during the day.review sample provided", "This cacao powder is certified organic and is imported from Peru.It is raw and fresh, which allows the unique complex flavor of the cacao to really shine.  It is excellent for baking or making chocolate sauce, but it would be a shame not to enjoy some of its tropical goodness in a milkshake with bananas, bit of vanilla, and a spoonful of coconut oil.  There is really no comparison with stale, over-processed cacao powder.As an extra benefit, cacao powder is high in fiber, magnesium, and iron.It is packaged in a heavy-duty zipper bag.Viva Labs provided cacao powder for evaluation and review.", "A high quality product, from Peru.  It's a very fine powder, ground from raw (unroasted) beans.  The taste is excellent.  I use it on desserts, but you can use it wherever you want a chocolaty flavor.A quick look at other brands currently available shows this to be the cheapest.  So really, I have nothing negative to say about it.I received a free sample of this product in return for an honest review, which is the only kind I give anyway.", "I usually buy plain old Hershey's cocoa because it's convenient, but then I was offered a sample of Viva Labs cacao. I never thought about the need for non-GMO or organic cocoa before, but it makes sense since I try to go that route with other foods. Viva Labs cacao powder is delicious and I love the fact that it's organic.  It isn't dark or as fragrant as Hershey's, but it also isn't as heavily processed. The powder is very fine and the flavor is rich and smooth, and offers good results in baking and other uses. I like to make a peanut banana smoothie on the weekends, and I add a spoon of cacao powder to it for a good shot of antioxidants. My smoothie contains natural peanut flour for protein, one banana, unsweetened almond milk, coconut flour for fiber, and cacao for antioxidants and another layer of richness. This is a good product that I'll stick with from now on.", "There are safety concerns about raw cacao powder and frankly there should be if you understand how most cocoa beans are processed and stored.  With that in mind I knew I needed to test this in either a cooked or baked recipe.  I chose a flourless chocolate cake with only four ingredients so I could maximize the need for the cacao powder and test the flavor with little interference.The raw cacao powder worked just as well as fully traditional cocoa powder in this recipe, in fact it had a slightly stronger cocoa flavor.  In terms of nutritional values it is better than traditional cocoa powder in most ways though be aware of the 2.5 T serving size on the label.I carefully cut the bag open where it said and found that it opened very wide making it easy to measure out.  However, and this is way I've given it 4 instead of 5 stars, no matter how I tried I could not get what should have been a resealable bag to seal up again so I had to fold over the top and clip it shut.  This means two things -- I need to use it much faster than I would a traditional cocoa powder in a canister and it used up clips I might have a need for elsewhere.Because of safety concerns and widespread variations in terms of processing of raw cacao powder, I cannot recommend anyone use this in a raw recipe.  Do that at your own risk."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.10505308210849762, 0.09416753053665161, 0.11588149517774582, 0.11721394211053848, 0.13164444267749786, 0.09975142031908035, 0.10522258281707764, 0.12722989916801453, 0.10383562743663788]]}
