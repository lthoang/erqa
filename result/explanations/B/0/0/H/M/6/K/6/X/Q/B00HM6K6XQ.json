My hair was dry and a mass of total frizz and it was with cautious hope that I applied this after coloring and shampooing. It smelled different from any other conditioner--in a great way, a fragrant soft musk/clove scent that encouraged me that maybe, just maybe this one really would be different.And it is! My hair was so fried and frizzy it wouldn't even hang straight down. It bushed out into an afro, from sun, home coloring and wind it gets exposed to every day in the tropics where I live.I noticed in the shower that when this rinsed out, my hair felt silky and straight and the tangles rinsed right out.And now my hair has shine and hangs straight! This is a first for me, to get this from a simple drugstore conditioner. This is a keeper and I PRAY they never stop making it. I'm throwing out all my other conditioners, because this is the only one that has ever done this. My hair shines like glass, moves, and all frizz is vanished and that's no lie. Ten stars for this! Don't stop making this Dove, please!", "This does a pretty good job of softening and helping my hair stay nice. It's most striking feature to me, though, is the coconut in its scent. It's more mellow than a lot of the very flowery stuff meant for women, which is a plus if you try to go easy on the perfumes or you're just not in the mood. Generally speaking, coconut isn't my favorite, but that's just personal preference and not an issue with the product.There's nothing really bad about it, it just also doesn't stand out in a big way either. It's a perfectly reasonable product for what it is.", "So the first thing you notice about this conditioner is the smell. It has a wonderful smell,I mean really really nice. I really liked that. It was a little thick going on, but that is neither good nor bad, just depends on what you like. As to how my hair felt after I would say it is a good but not great conditioner. I have had other conditioners leave my hair feeling more silky and smooth. However, my hair did come out fine; it wasn't frizzy and definitely helped with the dryness (I have very dry hair). So it does what it says it does, and a decent conditioner (with an amazing smell). It's at a good price point, and the ones that make my hair feel nicer is the brand that is much more expensive. So for the price, I would recommend it.", "I've got somewhat thick, curly Caucasian hair -- and I am always on the lookout for hair products to keep the frizz and flyways in check.  I thought this was so-so.  Honestly, I prefer conditioner that is a little little thicker, richer, heavier than this.  I don't think it has the conditioning power of a hot oil treatment, for example.  It certainly didn't leave my hair greasy, but it didn't really keep it as controlled as I would have liked.  After using it as a rinse-out conditioner a couple times, I tried rubbing a bit of the conditioner into my dry hair before styling -- I thought it was more effective that way, and it preserved the wonderful, baby powder scent.This was okay, but I doubt I will use again, as I don't think it's heavy-duty enough for my thick hair.", "This conditioner has a nice fragrance. It is on the mild side and not too overpowering. The conditioner is thick and creamy and does an adequate job of conditioning my hair. It rinses well and does not leave my hair feeling greasy.  Overall I would have to say that this conditioner is good, but there is nothing notably special about it.", "In my experience my hair looks softest and healthiest when I use salon brand shampoos and conditioners, especially those that are free of sulfates. (To date for my thick color-treated blonde hair Kevin Murphy's products have worked the best.) But when I'm on a budget or convenience-minded I've found the Dove shampoos and conditioners to be great for the money. While the results I get aren't quite on par with the salon shampoos, they do a pretty good job of keeping my hair soft and healthy and without any build up or residue.I was curious to tryDove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner, 12 Ouncebecause it is said to contain African Macadamia Oil and I have tried and liked other Macadamia Oil shampoos and conditioners in the past like the Macadamia Oil brand. Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner.  After using this conditioner, I think it is good but seems more similar to the other Dove conditioner varieties I've used in the past vs. the Macadamia Oil brand shampoo.  While it does a good job, especially for the price, it doesn't seem as moisturizing as the Macadamia Oil brand conditioner. I couldn't necessarily see a discernible difference between this conditioner and other Dove conditioners I've tried. No matter which I use the results seem very similar for me and my hair type, but obviously hair types can vary so my results may not be typical. But overall as long as you have reasonable expectations (I think it is unfair to expect a drug store conditioner to work as well as a salon conditioner given the huge price difference) I think it is a solid conditioner.", "This conditioner has more oil than most others.  It made my hair and that of other family members feel thick and soft.  It has a good scent.  I believe a little went far compared to most conditioners.", "This conditioner comes in a 12 fl oz. bottle that is about average size when compared to others. It's thick, white and creamy and has oil in it so it doesn't wash out immediately like a lot of conditioners. The oil really adds deep moisture, more so than the typical conditioner. I leaves my hair super soft and shiny and it's probably one of the best moisturizers that I have ever used. The scent is strong and floral. Sometimes strong floral scents can be overpowering but they got it right with this one. Overall just a great conditioner.", "The Dove Pure Care Dry Oil conditioner is formulated for dull, dry hair. I definitely have dull, dry hair. My hair is dry, coarse and frizzy all on it's own but now my hair is damaged from recent hair coloring and it's in even worse condition. The bottle says &#8220;nourishing oils can enhance silkiness and shine, without being greasy or weighing hair down. The conditioner is definitely non-greasy and did not weight my hair down as advertised. On the other hand, I didn't feel like my hair was any more silky or shiny than when I use any other conditioner.It's not a bad conditioner but to me, it's just average. I also do not care for the scent. The scent is slightly spicy, powdery and perfume-y all at the same time.", "This Dove conditioner works great!  It has a nice, pleasant smell and just a little bit is needed at a time.  It definitely leaves hair soft and silky, as the manufacturer claims.  I will definitely buy it again and would recommend.", "He has dry thinning hair and so we keep trying new things, looking of the perfect conditioner for  his hair.  This works well to soften his hair and he loves the smell. It smells like his favorite scent baby powder.", "I had high hopes for this conditioner. I have rough,extremely dry ,and frizzy hair. My hair is a challenge for any conditioner.This conditioner is very thick,rich and creamy. The scent is wonderful. You can feel the oil in this conditioner. One would think it would leave your hair moist and well conditioned. Sadly, it only helped a bit with my dryness and was no help at all with the tangles. I felt no silkyness.Overall, I think this conditioner would be most helpful to person with only slightly dry hair. If you have extremely dry hair like mine you will need to look elsewhere.", "After several years of straight hair I have gone back to natural curls. Curls need moisture and more moisture.This conditioner left my hair feeling soft. But it was a very flat soft. It didn't help with tangles and it smooshed my curls. It smells heavenly though. I also tried it for a co-wash without a shampoo and it was just a mess.", "Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner, 12 Ounce. This is a dreamy conditioner terrific for curly hair. Make sure you coat your ends with it carefully. Use a wide tooth comb if you can while it does its job. Rinse and your good to go. Good price for a good product that actually works. Cheaper than salon work.", "With the word &#34;oil&#34; in the name, I expected more moisture than I got. The conditioner was delightfully thick to the touch, so it stayed in my hair nicely, but when I went to rinse it out and let it dry, my damaged, dry, over-processed hair still needed some of the extra products I normally put in like leave-in conditioners, etc. I recently tried another product by some brand called &#34;Clear&#34; (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HNKRWI8) worked better for me. Still, I generally love Dove brand products, and were it not for the fact that I have to re-dye my hair every month (I have crazy neon &#34;fashion&#34; colors that are semi-permanent and fade quickly), I am sure this would have been enough. As it is, however, I need to bring in the big guns. This one didn't quite work on its own.", "This conditioner is a good reminder that you get what you pay for. It feels good going on, but doesn't moisturize as expected. It doesn't make your hair heavy and greasy, but also doesn't moisturize well. My biggest deterrent to using this product again is the fragrance. It is SUPER strong. If you like strong fragrances this is for you, but I prefer subtle. All in all, if probably give it 2.5 stars.", "great scent- I use this conditioner about 4 times a week to prevent hair from getting dry due to repeated shampoo use.  It really works, and mositurizers the hair well.  Highly recommended.", "This is great ARGON OIL Conditioner! I have tried many of the kinds of conditioners you can buy at your local super store with argon oil in them and I'd say this is the best one. I am hooked now!", "I wondered what a &#34;Dry Oil&#34; conditioner would feel like... actually, it seemed just like any other cheap conditioner I've used. Nothing in particular to love about it or hate about it... the scent is pretty mild and neutral (someone compared it to baby powder), it's thick, rinses out fairly easily, and leaves my hair better than if I didn't use any conditioner at all, but not as nice as when I use more expensive stuff. I didn't have the experience of my hair being &#34;five times silkier&#34; as claimed, and it's just okay at detangling. All in all, a fine product, but not one I'd go out of my way to purchase.", "\"I am a sucker for hair products so of course grabbed this when it became available. I should have skipped it. At first I thought \"\"Hey, cool, it smells like baby powder\"\" but then something else kicked in and WOW it has a VERY strong perfume-y scent. Bad enough that it made me want to wash my hair again to get rid of it. It literally made me scrunch up my nose and squint my eyes. And I could almost live with that IF it was a good conditioner--but it felt like super cheap conditioner in my hair. Normally conditioner has a FEEL to it in your hair but this stuff felt like it never even coated the hair (and of course I used way more than recommended as I have thick hair). After rinsing my hair didn't feel any different, either--it felt like it does after shampooing. And the scent lingered even after I towel-dried and blow-dried. NO THANK YOU.\"", "There are no instructions other than to apply to wet hair, so I made some up.  I glopped about a tablespoon on the ends of my hair after shampooing, counted to thirty and then rinsed.  The fragrance is lovely, and the texture is thick and cold creamy, so you really feel like it's doing something.Indeed, my very dry ends do feel better.  I haven't noticed much shine nor increased volume, but for a good all around basic conditioner, you could do a whole worse than Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner.", "I have no problem with the scent of the Dove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner which I find to be light and not long lasting.  I actually massage the conditioner into my cuticles before rubbing it through my hair, so I'm getting a twofold lubrication.  The package stands very securely and is appealing in the bathroom and it's easy to apply a small amount into the hand.  Affordable and without added color, this is a good product which I can recommend, but I do find that it weighs down my hair more than when I don't use the product.", "From my daughter: I have been using Dove shampoos, conditioners and soap for the last few years and really like using them. They never leave any build-up and my hair never seems to have any complaints when I use Dove products. This conditioner works as well as the Nourishing Oil Care conditioner that I normally use; however, the scent is a very strong baby powder scent which seems very different from the clean, fresh scent of all the other Dove products. The scent is just ok in my opinion and I will probably stick with the Nourishing Oil Care, and other Dove shampoos and conditioners.", "\"This is an OK conditioner but the baby powder scent is so strong, I won't be buying more.  I could still smell it the next day.  It's not a bad scent but as an adult, I really don't want to smell like a baby.  Also, the floor of the shower was like an oil slick after rinsing this off my hair.I have shoulder length, healthy hair.  I usually use a \"\"body\"\" shampoo & conditioner.  This is a medium-to-heavy conditioner.  It did not make my hair limp/greasy after using it but the next day, my hair was more limp and oily than usual & I could feel it on my scalp.  It's really too much conditioner for my hair.If you have fine/limp hair, this might be a bit much.  But if you have dry hair & like the smell of baby powder, this might be a good inexpensive choice.\"", "This is a very creamy white conditioner with what is to me, a mild to moderate perfume strenth, leaning towards mild.  It's a fairly feminine clean, floral modern scent that is nice.It absolutely leaves my long hair silky to the max.  I had my son feel it and he said &#34;It feels like a Halloween wig.&#34;  I thought maybe that was bad, but he explained, &#34;No, I mean that good- it's like it's brand new never out of the bag or tangled once.&#34;  Yes, my hair is UBER soft.It's thick and creamy - it feels almost like cold cream going on.  It rinses easily and I didn't notice any extended drying time for an air-dry.  (Some conditioners will make my hair take all night to dry, this one did NOT.)it doesn't weigh hair down, and it leaves it with lots of volume.My ONLY complaint is that it did leave my hair with tons of frizzy fly-aways, and I normally don't have a lot.  At first I didn't notice it, I just knew there was SOMETHING about it that was keeping me from loving this conditioner, but after using it for a few days, that got worse and worse.  I added some smoothing serum and now it's better, but that is a drawback to me.It dries with a good bit less scent than when it is applied.  The fragrance lasts about a day.", "I thought this conditioner kept my hair soft and supple. Nothing hard or sticky. I thought it was a really good product.", "The fragrance may not appeal to everyone but the product delivers smooth, shiny manageability to my wavy, curly, frizz-prone hair. I like the results without an oily residue feeling coating my hair. I liked the results after blow drying my hair better than when I air dried it. It definitely will remain part of my conditioner rotation.", "Several months ago, a bad dye job left my hair in horrible shape.  I've been getting it cut every month or two, and I will continue to do so until the damaged part finishes growing out enough to cut it all off.  It doesn't look too bad if I useCLEAR SCALP Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing ShampooandCLEAR SCALP Volumizing Root Boost Nourishing Conditioner.  It still gets tangled easier than before I damaged it, but the Clear Scalp keeps it manageable.The Dove Dry Oil Conditioner left my hair feeling silky and luxurious -- while I was in the shower.  As soon as my hair dried, the damaged part looked like straw.  I do realize it's my fault for damaging my hair with the bad dye job, but as long as there are other products out there (like the Clear Scalp) that leave my hair looking half-way decent until it grows out enough to cut off the damaged parts, I'll stick with the Clear Scalp.", "Dove Pure Care dry oil conditioner has a host of ingredients to moisturize the hair including a bit of sweet almond and macadamia oils.  It has a sweet scent that lasts quite a while, lightly floral.  It does a good job as a conditioner, leaving the hair silky but not weighted down.", "I am always looking for conditioners for my dry, fine hair and was excited to receive this Dove pure care dry oil conditioner.  Unfortunately, when it arrived it was open and had leaked all over the box but there was still some left in the container so I was able to try it.  I did use double the amount of conditioner the package recommends but I do have long hair.  I put it on after shampooing and left it on 4-5 minutes before rinsing.  I do think it made a difference in my hairs dryness but I did also use a spray conditioner after rinsing since the ends of my hair were still a bit dry and fly away.  This conditioner is nice and thick, smells very nice and seems to work well.  I love dove products so will continue to try them.", "I was very curious as to how this conditioner would function. With the oil, I wasn't sure if this would venture into uncharted territory for my hair care. Turns out, that wasn't exactly the case but that's not a bad thing.This product does function very much like a regular conditioner. It smells good and it has a good texture to it. My hair tends to be a bit frizzy from chlorine and I definitely saw results with that. My hair looks and feels better than it does with normal conditioners.You don't get the drastic results that you would with a deep conditioner, but I was pleased with the silky shine that this gave me. If you're looking to switch up your conditioner, you should really give this one a try. You get a good value and it will likely have you feeling great about your hair.", "I'm currently processing out years of dark dye so my hair is pretty dry and damaged. I ordered this because it seemed that something with 'oil' would feel nourishing and moisturizing on my dry, damaged hair.This left a waxy, unwashed feeling to my hair no matter how often I rinsed it out. My hair felt...fuzzy? I'm not sure how to explain the feeling. I normally use Pureology, I know Dove is no comparison to that stuff. But I did expect my hair to feel better than this, as if I used some cheap Suave stuff on my hair. I didn't like how dry it felt.Found lots of this on clearance at Walmart so maybe it's not so popular there, either."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.018840864300727844, 0.03595634922385216, 0.03300099074840546, 0.034155525267124176, 0.03472675755620003, 0.022983117029070854, 0.03330676630139351, 0.033231716603040695, 0.035304706543684006, 0.03363614156842232, 0.032625261694192886, 0.03154934570193291, 0.029759885743260384, 0.03546067699790001, 0.03217634558677673, 0.03147458657622337, 0.03161587193608284, 0.03277071565389633, 0.03362198546528816, 0.03073749877512455, 0.03088059462606907, 0.03385474160313606, 0.031086567789316177, 0.026363294571638107, 0.03150910511612892, 0.03359667584300041, 0.026335135102272034, 0.028327519074082375, 0.027749205008149147, 0.03151789307594299, 0.03401469066739082, 0.027829447761178017]]}
