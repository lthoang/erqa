"], "reviews": ["I've been using this conditioner with the same shampoo in this line and unfortunately after a month of use, it has left my hair weighed down and oily. I have shoulder length hair that is medium-weight, it's not particularly heavy so therefore I expected this product to work for me. It didn't and being a big fan of Dove products, this is one of the very few times I've felt let down. It could just be that it didn't work with my specific hair type and it may work wonderfully for someone else's. The scent is very clean and fresh and my hair did feel soft and tangle free, so I didn't hate this product, I just didn't love it.", "I&#8217;ve used this conditioner (and the shampoo) in the past so I was excited to see it in my monthly newsletter.Sadly, my thick hair doesn't react well to many shampoos on the market.  I&#8217;m happy to report that this product worked beautifully. After use, my hair looks healthy and shiny.  As for the volume, I didn&#8217;t notice a great deal of it after using the product.I&#8217;ve used this along with the shampoo, the smell is awesome and last for days.  I call it &#8220;perfume&#8221; for hair.  I will definitely buy this product again and will keep using this for as long as it is on the shelves.  You simply can't go wrong with Dove products.", "I've recently had my long thick hair cut and am now sporting a shorter more angled hair cut for summer. So I've had to switch out my usual thicker conditioners I used when my hair was long, to something lighter so my hair will stay fluffy. This Dove conditioner works nicely for this. It doesn't weigh my hair down and yet still conditions it to keep it soft. It has a great fragrance too. It works great and is a good choice for conditioner when you want something to make your hair soft, but not weight it down and make it flat.", "I have used this conditioner many times over the last 30 days.  I wash my hair most every day.  I haven't noticed anything special about this conditioner.  It doesn't provide much if any frizz control and it doesn't smooth my hair either.  The only thing I really like about is the light fragrance.  It's not overpowering like many shampoos and conditioners.", "Great value, non-premium price. I really love the Dove hair products &#8211; good clean not too perfumy gender neutral smell, good washoutability, not watery, just right for dry hair.  Great value, non-premium price.", "I didn't realize this conditioner was meant for fine hair. My hair is very thick, but I do have some annoying, wispy hairs that haven't been bothering me as much since using this. It doesn't do as good of a job at keeping my hair tangle free as the brand I usually use, but it works okay and keeps my hair soft. It doesn't small overpowering either. I can't say it gives any volume, as my hair has been flatter since using this. It's an average conditioner. Not bad, but not awesome either.", "In my experience my hair looks softest and healthiest when I use salon brand shampoos and conditioners, especially those that are free of sulfates.  (To date for my thick color-treated blonde hair Kevin Murphy's products have worked the best.)  But when I'm on a budget or convenience-minded I've found the Dove shampoos and conditioners to be great for the money.  While the results I get aren't quite on par with the salon shampoos, they do a pretty good job of keeping my hair soft and healthy and without any build up or residue.Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner, 12 Ounceis no exception.  I feel that it more than meets my expectations, especially for the price.  The only caveat worth noting is I don't necessarily see a discernible difference between this conditioner and other Dove conditioners I've tried.  No matter which I use the results seem very similar for me and my hair type, but obviously hair types can vary so my results may not be typical.  But overall I think it does a good job for the money.", "My hair type is long, naturally curly and color treated, so my biggest issue is usually dryness.  I tend to condition my hair every day, but only wash it every 2-3 days to keep it from drying out.  For me a conditioner that rinses out well, but still helps retain moisture in my hair is important.Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner,not only rinses well, but it also leaves my hair soft and with less frizz.  All in all it's a good conditioner to keep in my rotation of products and the price is very reasonable.", "I have thick hair that could occasionally use a little more &#34;oomph.&#34; So I tried this Dove Oxygen line in an effort to get that little extra boost. In the past, volumizing shampoos and conditioners have tended to leave me with 80s looking &#34;mall hair&#34; ... just too much volume! Nonetheless, this conditioner gave me the small boost that my long, weighty hair needed. The results were subtle (which is what I wanted) but really quite lovely. (Shiny, bouncy, clean hair!)Other notes: mild scent, clean rinsing, and inexpensive. Finally, the upside-down bottle makes get those last drops easy. Try it, you may love it!", "Dove designed its Oxygen Moister Conditioner for ladies with fine, flat hair with its oxygen-fused formula that quickly spreads into your hair.The new moisture formula is marketed by Dove as Oxyfusion Technology and claims to make your fine, flat hair more lively and easily rinses off your hair without leaving residues. It has a nice clean scent and retains the body in your hair for days. This 12-ounce product is very reasonably priced which makes it easy to try.My wife's hair is fine and she likes to use a conditioner that will give her hair body after one use, which this product did. She likes it and I think you might also.", "This conditioner has a great scent and feels rich and creamy. My hair is very dry so I had high hopes of this adding some extra moisturizing to my hair. It makes my hair feel well conditioned while its still wet but when my hair is dry ( I air dry) it looks and feels dry.  It leaves me with flyaways. My hair is also thick so this product may be more suited to fine hair.", "I love the Dove Oxygen Moisture foam. It has been great for me. But this conditioner did not work well for me.This conditioner did not feel very moisturizing while I used it. But after I rinsed it out, I could not even tell I had conditioned. But as my hair started to dry it felt filmy and coated. I made sure that i rinsed a lot the next time I used it, but it was still filmy and flat.", "Dove oxygen moisture conditioner is a winner. If I was going to race it against another product I would bet all my money on this one knowing it will win. This conditioner will run you all day, all night, and to your personal finish line.", "Dove hair products always work out well, and this one is no exception! The scent is light, and if used with a good shampoo, the conditioner moisturizes and adds shine without weighing hair down. Good stuff, especially for treated hair!", "I have dry hair and dry scalp, so using this conditioner 3-4 times a week keeps the scalp and hair moisturized and clean smelling.", "I have super fine hair so I often need a good conditioner to add moisture and volume.  Without a good conditioner, then my hair is very straight and limp.  This did really well.  It gave me some body and my hair does not feel brittle or dry.  While I still need something more to add the extra bounce, this is a good everyday conditioner that isn't super expensive.", "I love the nice, clean scent that this Dove Conditioner leaves behind in my hair. It feels good going on, my hair feels soft after rinsing. I have thin hair, but frizzy hair. So the day after conditioning, my hair felt very soft, but I still had a lot of flyaways. I will definitely keep using this conditioner until it's gone, as I really like how my hair feels and smells. But I think it's a little bit pricey, since I don't see a huge change compared to my cheap conditioner.", "I need a conditioner to do 1 thing:  detangle my superfine hair without leaving so much residue that my hair comes out limp.  While this conditioner detangles nicely, my hair is definitely limp and lifeless after using it along with the matching shampoo.  It doesn't feel as if there's residue, but the lack of volume (something the ads claim it provides) makes it not worth using.  Someone with less determinedly flat hair might have better results with this conditioner, but I've had better hair with Dove's regular volumizing shampoo-conditioner combo.", "I have used this product several times and it work just fine.  I do have thin fine hair and have to be careful with conditioners .  They can be heavy and make my hair very flat.  Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner does not do that.  It leaves my hair soft but with body.  It does what it says.", "I have been eying Dove's new Oxygen Moisture product line for a little while now. After trying it, I have to say I am quite disappointed. While the smell is amazing (I want everything now to smell like this stuff), the product itself doesn't do much for me. The Conditioner leaves my hair smelling great, but that is about it. The Conditioner feels normal until I put it in my hair, then it is like it disappears. My hair feels like there is nothing in it. Which is fine if I saw results, but sadly I really didn't.", "Dove's Oxygen Moisture conditioner is amazing. It has a light and creamy texture and left my hair really soft. I also tend to use conditioner as a shave cream, as well, and this is a pretty decadent one. I'm really pleased with this conditioner. Also, I have very fine blonde hair, so I have to be careful about moisturizers because they can leave my hair greasy, so the fact that my hair is just soft is a big deal to me. Highly recommended.", "\"I really thought I was going to love this conditioner because it is designed for fine, flat hair and the bottle says \"\"enjoy beautifully bouncy and moisturized hair, full of natural volume.\"\"  My hair is fine and long and is flat to wavy but will curl on its own if left to air dry or in rainy weather.This conditioner goes on like any other conditioner.  It smells really nice and after applying to my wet hair, it was easy for me to run a comb through my hair.  Therefore, it has all the properties I'm looking for in the shower.  However, after my hair was dry, it felt somewhat conditioned but was on the flat side so that was disappointing.  I actually like theDove Pure Care Dry Oil Conditioner, 12 Ounceso much better as a conditioner. (The link to my review for this conditioner is in the comments section of this review for those who are interested.)Personally, the results I got with this Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner for fine, flat hair would not encourage me to purchase this product.  The results are just not WOW enough for me.\"", "I like this product fine.  It's not as scented as I normally like - I like a heavy scent.  I have long hair and like to catch a whiff of it if I toss my head.  This one is barely noticable after my hair dries.This one is pleasant to smell, a bit feminine, and leaves hair smelling fresh if someone sticks their nose in your hair, but not really perfumed.  Some may like it better for that.It works ok.  It reminds me of when I use a light, inexpensive conditioner and THEN add some hair oil (like macadamia nut or something) before drying my hair.  It leaves my hair shiny and soft, with fewer fly-aways, and lots of body.It's really ok.  I'd buy it again if I found a good deal on it, but it is not one of my preferred brands.", "The Vine program at Amazon offered me the opportunity to try both the Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner, and the Dove Oxygen Shampoo. I had been wanting to try both and was pleased with the opportunity to receive hem from Vine. I have been using them both for about a week. I know that isn't long in the scheme of things, but for some times I have been using an expensive salon shampoo. I was pleased with those products, but notice I said expensive. The Dove Oxygen shampoo and conditioner leave my hair feeling just as soft and clean as the salon products. It doesn't weigh my hair down or make my natural curls droopy or flat.  So really, why spend double the money?I recommend these products.", "I used this conditioner in conjunction with the matching Dove Oxygen Moisture Shampoo.  I found the shampoo to be quite drying, so the conditioner had a significant job to do.  This conditioner is quite thin, as is expected of a volumizing conditioner.  It did an okay job on my hair, but not wonderful.  In all honestly, the matching shampoo was so harsh on my hair that I'm not sure the conditioner ever had a chance.  My hair was not bouncier, nor was it silkier (again, though, I think some of that blame can be placed on the shampoo).  This conditioner does smell good- with a pleasing fresh scent.  If you want a light conditioner, my advice would be to use this conditioner with a different shampoo (Dove or otherwise, I've found some of Dove's other shampoos to be quite good).", "I made a mistake getting this, as it's for fine, limp hair.  I have thick hair with lots of body.  I found that if I used a smaller amount, I could not comb through my hair.  A larger amount allowed me to comb through easily, but weighed my hair down.  On the other hand, it's really great to shave my legs!  Really leaves my legs soft :)", "I got this for my daughter and she absolutely loves it. Her hair is shinier and healthier and has a lot of bounce. Will definitely re-order this and the shampoo.", "I really like this conditioner and will buy it again.Nice and light when applying, great detangler.Easy rinse and adds body.", "Even though my hair is short I have to be careful because I live with well water.  Ugh.  Conditioning it can be a challenge.  I need something that isn't oily, but conditions my hair so that I can brush it when I get out of the shower.  I don't like heavy conditioners.  This one does a good job of it.  It conditions my hair without weighing it down and making it oily too quickly.  It does a good job all throughout my hair:  roots to end.I've been lucky to find a couple of conditioners that do a good job with my hair and Dove is one of them.", "I love the new Oxygen Moisture line by Dove.  It is great.  The smell is fantastic.  It goes on thick not runny like many inexpensive brand and rinses clean leaving soft, smooth hair after rinsing.  It is the perfect pairing with the Oxygen Moisture shampoo.  The combo is perfect for my fine hair and really did give a little more fullness.  It is reasonably priced, and I would buy it again.  Great product with an exceptionally nice scent!", "I gave this conditioner five stars because the price is right, my hair styles nicely when I use it, my hair feels soft and it has a pleasing light scent.  This product is designed for women with fine, flat hair.  I wouldn't describe my hair as fine or flat, but it still worked nicely on my hair.  Another fine product from Dove.", "My hair is waist length, blonde and straight and has a strong tendency to get dried out in spite of me not blow drying it.  But it also gets oily super quickly.  So finding a conditioner that moisturizes well without causing oily head is hard.  I usually use those heavy mask conditioners and I love them.... but I always want something a little more normal that also works well near my roots so that my hair doesn't get as oily as quick (counter-intuitive, but it does work).  This one is a little gem. It worked decently enough on my entire hair, ends as well (although not as well as a mask); but the charm is in how it works on my roots and upper section of my hair.Moisturizes the best of any &#34;normal&#34; conditioner that I've tried but leaves my hair shiny and clean without being greasy!"], "Gamma": [0.2938120365142822, 0.36453354358673096, 0.3416544198989868], "Beta": [[0.03116997890174389, 0.03225194290280342, 0.03104378655552864, 0.031095311045646667, 0.03127431496977806, 0.03203153610229492, 0.0274252537637949, 0.03135909140110016, 0.031330499798059464, 0.03060321882367134, 0.031156769022345543, 0.031232085078954697, 0.03157343715429306, 0.031137388199567795, 0.031196951866149902, 0.03181753307580948, 0.030797457322478294, 0.03283886983990669, 0.031424615532159805, 0.031285855919122696, 0.03150564432144165, 0.029751434922218323, 0.03142205625772476, 0.03127623349428177, 0.031093010678887367, 0.031165584921836853, 0.03168509900569916, 0.03106079064309597, 0.03167302906513214, 0.03168054297566414, 0.03126846253871918, 0.03237221762537956], [0.03156181797385216, 0.034831453114748, 0.030276594683527946, 0.028944317251443863, 0.03269924968481064, 0.032727621495723724, 0.024000586941838264, 0.03082369826734066, 0.030799560248851776, 0.026301788166165352, 0.030988460406661034, 0.031600359827280045, 0.029730120673775673, 0.031284719705581665, 0.03129655122756958, 0.032284609973430634, 0.030710335820913315, 0.03777369111776352, 0.03166443109512329, 0.03230535611510277, 0.03264368698000908, 0.024640271440148354, 0.03168090805411339, 0.031152166426181793, 0.033393967896699905, 0.03182481229305267, 0.03237397223711014, 0.031165000051259995, 0.03203173726797104, 0.03187025710940361, 0.031832531094551086, 0.032785337418317795], [0.031511079519987106, 0.03484220802783966, 0.02995183877646923, 0.028770441189408302, 0.03319590911269188, 0.03239651396870613, 0.025887804105877876, 0.030425293371081352, 0.030374757945537567, 0.02642081119120121, 0.030791686847805977, 0.03143385052680969, 0.03007262758910656, 0.031191250309348106, 0.031092606484889984, 0.03196972981095314, 0.03057938814163208, 0.0375557616353035, 0.03137130290269852, 0.03233158215880394, 0.032569412142038345, 0.025971796363592148, 0.03129860758781433, 0.030919194221496582, 0.034795623272657394, 0.03176850453019142, 0.03212153539061546, 0.031000759452581406, 0.03181016072630882, 0.03154651075601578, 0.031675953418016434, 0.032355472445487976]]}
