He does such a wonderful job I do not want to mess around with his settings! As a mom of young kids I love pictures, but the pictures leave out some of the precious things about childhood. Still photos can't capture the way your preschoolers voice sounds while they practice the songs for the school Christmas show. Still photos don't capture the mood for me when my son is quietly and intently doing Lego's. I wanted a video camera for myself.I have had a little Kodak PlayFull pocket video camera for a few years, and while I have taken some cute videos on the fly (since I can carry it in my purse in the zipper pocket) it can't zoom in worth beans. Not so good when you're in the 12th row at the Christmas show. This Sony video camera does everything I need, and it does it without making me take a lot of time to learn how. I'm not personally interested in the intricacies of photography, I just want to be able to whip on the video camera before they stop doing whatever I want to film. The stabilization of the image the camera gives me is fantastic, you can't even tell when my preschooler is climbing my leg while I'm taping her brother. I took the camera to Disneyland recently and gave the zoom in and out a workout as the kids were going around on the carousel. Never once did the video lose focus. So easy to use and fantastic video. Perfect for me.", "The Sony HDRCX330 is an inexpensive camcorder that records in both high resolution (AVCHD) and lower quality (mp4) formats. By default, in fact, it will record in both at the same time. The reason for this gets to the heart of this camcorder, a camcorder that bridges a gap with mobile devices, presumably for sharing video with social media networks.The camcorder itself features a 30x optically stabilized lens with a fairly wide 26.8mm focal length. This gives it a lot of flexibility in shooting - just what is needed for casual use. It has a built in USB cable that is used for charging (via the supplied wall charger and USB extension cable) and for attaching to a computer (in disk mode, for copying files off the camcorder). The HDMI port is very compact, but fortunately a HDMI cable with the right connector is included. There is also a multi i/o port that can be used for standard composite video out with an optional cable. There is no microphone in jack on the camcorder.The camcorder records in various data rates for quality/size choices, up to 1920x1080 60p resolution. At it's maximum, it is 28 mb/s, which is not stellar, but in line with the inexpensive cost of the camcorder. The video itself looks clean, given good lighting. As with all inexpensive camcorders, noise creeps in a bit in dim light, but there is a low-light setting that may alleviate some of that. The one criticism is that there was a little bit of blowout in high contrast scenes outdoors in the middle of the day - not a enough to be a serious problem. The optical stabilization works quite well, which is good given the lightweight of the camcorder. It accepts two different forms of memory cards - Sony's Memory Stick Micro (up to 16GB) - and microSD (Class 4 or better, up to 64GB in size). I shot with an inexpensive Kingston Class 4 card and experienced no problems with recording.This camcorder features both wifi and NFC connectivity (along with the builtin USB connector). The wifi is used for file transfer - either to a desktop computer - or a smartphone (Android or iPhone). This is the value of the dual recording ability - you have a version of the video that is appropriate for playback on a handheld device - and of course - posting to social media sites like Youtube, Facebook etc. On my Mac, I had to download and install a piece of software, pair the camcorder with the Mac, and then tell the camcorder to send the video to my computer. While there were several steps here, Sony walks the user through the process. And again - there is always the built in USB connector as another way to transfer the video. One curious thing I noticed was that once the camcorder connected to my access point, it showed up as a shared device on my Mac - but I wasn't able to figure out how to connect to it. I was only able to transfer files using Sony's software. I feel this is a missed opportunity - something that should work but doesn't. But not a deal breaker.Sony also has software for Android and iOS devices for transferring video from the camcorder and remotely controlling it. It is minimalistic - you can copy files from the camera and have them scaled to size (or not) - but works fine. The remote control operation gives you a real time view of the camera, and has simple controls for recording and operating the zoom.Inexpensive camcorders face the same challenge as inexpensive still cameras - the smartphone. Sony has tried to make a good case for owning an inexpensive video camcorder by including features that smartphones (for the most part) don't have - such as the 30x powered optically stabilized zoom lens - but allowing the camera to be tied to a phone for video editing and sharing. It is an interesting value proposition. In all, it is a capable and inexpensive camera that works well enough, and has some simple but useful connectivity options.", "This is the same time I am using what I call a Camcoder... I usually used my standard cameras to film videos. I also started using a GoPro.What do I like:- Very light- 1080p video definition.- Easy to use- Work in low light environment.- Can take pictures while shooting video (with some resolutions).- USB cable contained in the camcoder (very convenient).- Nice microphone and sound capture.- Nice battery lifeWhat I like less:- Video quality is much less impressive than the GoPro.(the other side of the coin is that videos do take less space).- No carrying case.Conclusion:The Go-Pro may have much better video quality but is nowhere as easy to use (lack of screen, tiny size) and is defined more for spectacular (and short activities).For convenience, the Sony Camcoder is much better. You may lose in final quality but the video is still pretty good.I would recommend this product.", "The best things about this camera are its size (roughly the size of my eyeglasses case) and its weight.  It does have a tendency to feel somewhat cheap because of it, but I think its more perception than anything.I like this over my GoPro because of the additional features like the enhanced zoom and wider angle.  The picture doesn't QUITE reach the GoPro level in my opinion, but it's honestly pretty darn close.  I hooked it up to the TV and it looked great.  The phone controls are also pretty cool.In all, if you want something with a bit more features and easy UI, this is a great option.  I'm very happy with it and it doesn't disappoint!", "If you aren't happy with videos from your smartphone, this is a great opportunity to step up.  Not much bigger than a large phone and super light, the Sony HDRCX330 takes great video.What you get:- 30x Optical Zoom:  This, IMHO, is the single biggest feature.  I was able to record my daughter's school play from the back of the room with no trouble.  The video from sporting events, kids' stage shows, and other places where you can't get close to the action is just head and shoulders above what you would get from your phone.- Image stabilization:  It's surprising how well this controls jitter.  You still want to brace yourself if you can, but the picture is not nearly as jerky as you would expect.- A flip out screen:  This is perfect for when you have to hold the camera up above a crowd, or if you want a different angle.  You can see the shot you're getting but still get an angle that's not in front of your face.  (It's not a touch screen, but I didn't have any problem using the joystick to work the menus.)- Great picture, even in low light.- A suprising amount of connectivity.  This thing has a short USB cable built in, then comes with a USB extender cable.  It also has built in wifi and DLNA, so it can connect directly to a phone (for posting to youtube, etc), a computer, or a TV.  With Son'y's apps, you can also remote control the unit from your phone.Note: It requires a microsd card, so pick one up.All in all, I really liked this - it's easy to use and performs a lot better than my old alternatives.  Recommended.", "My first impression about this camera is the very small size. In order to compete with smartphones I believe a video camera these days needs to give you some incentive to carry around an extra device. The small size make this less inconvenient. This camera also has some advantages that a cell phone does not offer. The first thing that comes to mind is the option of using on a tripod. If you intend to use the camera to record events such as school concerts/plays or sporting events then a tripod is almost a necessity and this camera works very well on a tripod.I used this camera to record a school event for my daughter and had mixed impressions. First, the sound was actually very nice. It was easy to hear and not choppy at all. The video, on the other hand, was not great. The lighting at the school was not ideal which I believe was a major part of the lackluster video, but this is something to consider. If you are shooting any video with poor lighting, such as almost anything under fluorescent lights then you may not get the best results. I would also recommend zooming in as little as possible since the optical zoom will reduce the image quality.If you intend to use this camera for the reasons I stated above and are not expecting professional results then this camera should work just fine.", "This camera takes good video, but not enough better than the video function on a still camera to warrant carrying it.  Being able to control the camera with you tablet or phone is cool, but is a feature that is better suited for GoPro type cameras that are more likely to be inaccessible.If you really want a separate video camera, this isn't terrible, but really isn't much better than the video you get from a point and shoot or DSLR set to video mode.  My only big complaint is that transferring the video off of this camera over USB 2.0 takes forever.  For an HD camera not to include a faster transfer protocol is absurd.I got 3.5 hours of battery life using this camera to record HD video.  That isn't bad, but again, my DSLR can do better.My advice to you, if you really need a separate camcorder from your still camera is to go higher end, such asCanon VIXIA HF G30 HD Camcorder with HD CMOS Pro.  Otherwise, I would stick to a still camera that can also take HD video.  In most cases, you'll find that this will work better for both purposes, than trying to use a video camera as a still camera.", "\"First impression taking out the HDRCX330 from the box is how far we've come in the video world. This thing is tiny, barely larger than a Twinkie(and sort of shaped like one). The small size is quickly followed up by the light weight - this thing feels as light as a feather. While the body is mostly made of plastic, the parts all fit solidly and there's no give or that general feeling of \"\"cheapness\"\" that's usually associated with plastic-based camcorders.Performance-wise, it was here and there, honestly.  The autofocus seems to be one of the slower ones I've played around with, taking anywhere from 1-3 seconds to refocus due to a subject change. They're not joking about the minimum focus length either - attempting to do a close zoom-in on a subject closer than 20\"\" from the camera lens causes the autofocus to fail completely (even when the close up subject is taking up the entire field). I believe the manual states the minimum field to be 80cm, but it really seemed like you needed to be even further from your subject than that. While this won't be too much of a concern for people picking up this unit for things like family gatherings, it makes it only semi-usable in close-up applications.The UI is very simplistic, giving you very little control over specific settings. The range of options is generally along the lines of: auto/outdoor/indoor/spot. Not a lot of manual tweaking.Small thing to note, this unit does not come with any sort of memory card or a separate battery charger. The unit uses micro-SD cards and the battery is charged on the unit itself (ie: you put the battery into the camcorder and plug the camera into the wall). So if you're the type who picks up a second battery, make sure you pick up one with a charger as well.All-in-all, this is a pretty good base unit which works well for the price point. However it is very much a plain point and shoot with only average performance and zero bells and whistles. Having said that, if you just need a camera to pick up and shoot video, this is a good little camera.\"", "For the price, this is a fantastic camera. It doesn't feel very substantial, and indeed it is mostly lightweight plastic -- drop this on the sidewalk and it's a goner -- but it takes wonderful video. And the zoom is spectacular! Optical stabilization technology has really come a long way. I can zoom in all the way, hand holding without a tripod, and keep a moving object within view and focused.The wonderful zoom, coupled with its low-light abilities, make this camcorder an easy recommendation."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.1511411815881729, 0.0012059403816238046, 0.09006001055240631, 0.0028502417262643576, 0.4037463068962097, 0.3393344581127167, 0.004772762767970562, 0.0015466987388208508, 0.00534238712862134]]}
