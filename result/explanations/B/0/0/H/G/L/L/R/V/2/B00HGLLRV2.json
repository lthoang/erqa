When I got my PS4, this was one one the games I got with it.First off, it's a great looking game but then that's what you come to expect with the next-gen PS console. The other PS4 game I got (Tomb Raider) definitely didn't disappoint in that department either. The controls are easy enough to get used to, even though they are different than the previous two. The storyline is a completely new one, with a few nods to the others but it stands on its own.Now, here's where I thought it was lackluster and and I'm wondering where all these 5 star &#34;amazing&#34; &#34;stellar&#34; and &#34;awesome&#34; reviews are coming from. How in the heck do you keep track of your health? The only thing you know is when you are close to dead or are are dead. It was much easier to recover or gain health before, just find a power line and voila! Now, you have to find a shard or some smoke to drain, which can be difficult in the midst of a fight. Or, find some cover, which if you're being surrounded by armed guards, particularly the ones with powers, can also be difficult. You don't seem to pose a real threat to the armed forces until your powers are highly upgraded, which will take quite awhile. You die way too easily. A few turret hits or a few armed guards surrounding you with gunfire is all it takes. Then when you die, you end up at the closest fast travel destination but if you already cleared that district, what's the point of being there? You have to then high tail it back to the district you're working on.Lastly, the game is very repetitive. Clear the main command center in a district, complete all the side missions, collect all the shards, do the showdown, onto the next district, then  wash, rinse, repeat. It gets really boring after awhile.Overall, there are definitely aspects to the game that are enjoyable but after the first 2, I expected to be blown away and this did far from that.", "This game looks beautiful, but it plays horrible compared to the other infamous games. When I bought this game from Gamestop, I was disappointed, and am still regretting buying this game.", "Going through more of Sucker Punch's latest inFamous sequal, Second Son, I find myself experiencing multiple feelings at the same time, hate, anger, and enjoyment. But what I look for in any game, Second Son seems to have less of.Easy of Navigation: As someone who has NO sense of direction, I will tell you now that I found the map to be offputing. It doesn't at all have the functionality needed to tell you where to find point A or B. You cannot properly mark your point of interest, which bothers me insanely. A prime example was a good karma mission that came up and I had trouble locating it. The map overall is just, too distracting, too pretty.Functionality: I find that Bioware seems to have a better grasp more and more on how difficulty and game mechanics should be, the case is not so with Sucker Punch. It feels as though Sucker Punch either learned nothing from inFamous 2 or learned so little that it hardly mattered in the grand scheme of things. You find yourself treated to not one, but three different sets of powers, smoke, neon and video (in that order). The problem is that these are nearly identical, with only a handful of things that seperate them from one another, besides those differences that are aesthetic, that is. What I would have really prefered more then anything when playing through Second Son is a decent defense power. Dashing around is nice, but there are sometimes that I feel that I am trapped in an enclosed space, thus it becoming totally useless. Whether or not the recovery effect was in the other inFamous games is pointless, but what bothers me is that it exists. It is distracting to me, especially when I find myself being attacked from multiple sides.Activities: From what I've ever seen, most inFamous games have activities in one way or another, some good and others bad. With this sequal, there comes activities that remove the D.U.P's control by a varied percentage. I have no real opinion, except when it comes to the stencil minigame in which you move this curser that you can barely see and use the R2 button to cover a specific surface until you alternate to another stencil and so on. Making the curser highly visible would have been prefered personally, especially since I do have bad vision. The others, I think are unimpressive, but managable at best.Extra Content: For such an open world game, there seems little to do aside from help the innocent, be a jerk, or fight the D.U.P. The game hardly breathes, feeling as though (again), Sucker Punch didn't learn as much as I would have liked from their previous success in inFamous 2. It doesn't even bother me about the claims of Seatle being too unimpressive, but I would have liked to see options that are prevailent in games like Grand Theft Auto V and Sleeping Dogs (like changing your clothes or improving your apartment?).Conclusion: If it comes bundled with your playstation 4, then by all means play it. For a bundled game, it isn't all bad. But I would never in my own right mind suggest to any consumer to buy it. If you must buy it, then wait it out a few months to give Sucker Punch the chance to update and patch the game.", "First off I don't buy much on Amazon any more, because you pay for it ( get free shipping ) or then pay for shipping or &#34;prime&#34; then either way wait 3 weeks for it to be shipped. I refuse to pay the same price as in store when I can get it that day. So any way onto the review this game has held my attention for the last week, That is saying something because I have a stack of favorites I play for a few hours then return to in a week.The story is both interesting and engaging, the graphics are amazing, and the mechanics keep you involved. It is essentially a perfect game while remaining modern in both culture and ideals. The idea that a group of super human's evolve into society and the government rounds them up out of fear while demonizing them. seems both immoral and probably reality if it ever really happened.Then you have the star of the show, who is a rebel looking for his calling which gets completely tossed into the entire story by mistake. but is fitting that his own brother is a sheriff, who follows the law to a queue but some how see's his brother has met his calling and is supportive in his own way.It really brings you into the story and keeps you involved and entertained in a pretty vast for most part open world. where this really shines is, it reminds me a lot of the open scenery of GTA where you have a ton of side missions but where this picks up is where GTA falls flat.The open world of Second Son lets you roam and terrorize but gives you a option &#34;Karma&#34; you have the choice for Good or Bad Karma both have their advantages  and which one you pick determines how you will advance your power. and what weapons you will get with your powers. It also dictates how the world around you will perceive you. will you get the support of the people ? and create a riot to tip the odds in your favor ? or will you rule by fear and not have the backing of the people ?In the end it is up to you, the side missions consist of running down the enemy patrols taking over their bases and mobile command centers. while your main objective is to find other conduits ( super humans ) and steal their powers to advance yourself and eventually take on the head of the D.U.P ( enemy ) if you play your cards right, you can gain a team of conduits to create your own force to reckon with against the enemy.It is a truly engaging game and story, that has a little bit of everything.", "I downloaded this off of PSN. It is one of the funnest games I have ever played so far. I am about 5 hours into the game. It doesn't disappoint.", "First, you have probably noticed that there is no verified purchase. If you want you can check my profile, I will be posting a review of the version I bought. I bought the limited edition one. The reason I am reviewing the standard is this:A. It is basically the same game (minus a couple unlockables)B. I love telling people about great gamesC. I am tired of spam unfair reviews.Letter c is the real reason I decided to write this. At the time of writing this review, there is one person who has reviewed this game, on all three editions, and gave the same 1 star review on all three editions. If you click on his profile, it is full of them. On 6 playstation games, he has given one star reviews with bad reasons.Now to the actual game:For a couple of months now I have been waiting for this game, and I am not disappointed. This shows off what we will come to expect from our next gen systems. With just 5 months after the launch of the ps4, we do no longer await greatness, greatness is here. The graphics are the best that I know of anywhere. This is no lie, they are absolutely stunning. I have not played a more graphically advanced game ever. Since it is an exclusive, the developers could really focus on one system, and they really brought out the big guns.Secondly, the story mode is great. After the first two Infamous games, I was sad to see our main character go. It does not matter because we have been brought another lovable figure. I have started to grow onto him already! The use of features like neon and smoke are great. It lets you personalize how you like to get around.Cole will be missed, but Delsin is a great replacement! Really though, this is a must have for PS4. I wasn't a single player game person till I played inFAMOUS 2. Now I love them.  I have not experienced any frame rate drops, or mistimed lip syncs.Pros-Open worldStunning graphics (again the best I have ever witnessed)New power ups (like smoke and neon)Great story line that you expect in a single player gameCons-In all honesty, I wouldn't add anything to this side. I'm afraid if I changed anything I wouldn't love this game as I do now. If you leave a comment with some cons, I will be sure to include them if they are reasonable. I am looking forward so much to this game!I cannot stress how much this game rocks! It is a staple to the ps4 in my opinion, but what do I know?I will be posting some gameplays on my YouTube channel if you are still undecided, or just wanna watch some of Infamous Second Son! Just search Gandalf The Teal on YouTube and it will come up. Scroll down to the Infamous section and enjoy! Please subscribe if you have a chance also, it means a lot to me to see people like my content. I don't put ads on them so this is all just for fun! I will be posting the Wednesday after getting this game!Thank you much for reading to the end. Hopefully this was informative.  Please like this review if you benefited in any way from this! I will answer any questions in the comments if you ask!", "Its what I would say as the first true PS4 game. Only on PS4 and shows off alot of its power.. Its really fun and since there really isnt much out you might as well..", "I am an older casual gamer.  I bought myself a PS3 two years ago but quickly got bored because I couldn't get into any games other than golf and Wipeout.  I tried Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, and Need For Speed Most Wanted.  The system also came bundled with Uncharted.  Nothing captivated me enough to play more than an hour or two at most.  Afterward,  I'd place the game down and never play it again.  That wasn't the case with Infamous because this game is FUN! I honestly expected to feel the same way as I did with previous games but this game has just the right amount of everything I find interesting.  I found myself grabbing this game during every free moment.First, the story.  The basic theme is that a bus crashes in a small suburb of Seattle and a few conduits (or bio-terrorists, depending on who's side you're on), escape.  Our protagonist inadvertently exposes himself to one of these conduits and inherits conduit powers.  I won't spoil the story beyond that but it involves a trek to Seattle which leads to lots of fighting and tons of side missions that are actually fun and interesting.  I usually found the side missions in games like GTA and Saints Row to be boring and felt like they interrupted the main missions more than enhanced them.  The side missions in Infamous all mesh perfectly together and feel more like one big cohesive unit rather than disjointed individual pieces.  Another factor that jacks up the excitement level is the acquiring of additional and stronger powers.  You start out with smoke but gather other powers as the game progresses.  The graphics of this game are jaw-dropping for a console and must be seen to be believed on the PS4. Once again, I won't spoil it by revealing all the powers you can acquire, but you will enjoy collecting them, trust me.  By game's end, I acquired every power and upgrade possible for my karma selection.  Speaking of karma, you're forced to choose wether you want to follow the good or bad karma storyline at the beginning of the game.  The choices you make will affect your karma level which ultimately affects your abilities and upgrades.  I completed the game on good karma and I'm about to replay it on the bad karma selection.If you're a casual gamer like me who really needs a special game that sets itself apart from the pack, this is the one.  Get it.  You won't regret it.", "Horrible game, the beginning should have foretold the rest of it......let me get some smoke to make my keystrokes more forceful.", "So when this game was initially announced, it just did not appeal to me.  I played the first one, and I just was never much of a fan of the Infamous franchise.  Well, this game was so talked up and the reviews were so good that I decided to give it a whirl.  $60 is not a small amount of money, so I definitely hoped that I did not regret my purchase on this one.  Let me say &#8211; it is worth every penny so far.  First of all &#8211; the graphics on the PS4 for this game are amazing.  It does an awesome job of showcasing the potential of the PS4.  The sights of Seattle are totally breathtaking and the amount of detail shown in the characters&#8217; faces is unreal.  Also, this is one of the few games that really utilizes the new features of the DualShock 4 controller.  The touchpad and the speaker are both used in very cool ways for this game.  The gameplay is also very fun.  I think it&#8217;s a bit challenging, but not so hard that you will want to throw your controller across the room and give up.  I like that there is a specific storyline, but that there is also this open world that you can explore as well as tons of side missions.  I find myself wanting to play so that I can complete every single part of this game.  I have probably already put around 8-10 hours into it and I feel like I have barely scratched the surface - talk about getting your money&#8217;s worth!  This is definitely one of the best PS4 games to date.  Awesome.", "It took me some time to get into Infamous Second Son. I was a fan of the previous titles and was super excited for this one.However, after starting it I was not really blown away (the graphics were amazing but the story was not).However, after you advance and begin to learn to powers the story started to grow on me too and by the time I was finished I immediately started a new game to play through on a harder difficulty and as an evil version of Delsin.The villain in this game is awesome, I really wish they had more screen time since they make you love to hate them.The graphics in this game are quite possibly the best this gen, so far. The effects and the facial expressions are top notch, though some characters work better than others and a few (the females mainly) came off a bit awkward.The powers are awesome, and though some are basically clones of the others (blasts, flight) they all have enough little differences to make switching them out not only fun but often necessary to advance.Sadly, all of the enemies have pretty much exactly the same powers and just use them slightly differently.I kept waiting for something big to happen like in the first two games where there were such a large variety of abilities on display (ice, oil/fire, electricity, shape shifting, mind control) but it never happens.The story has several missed opportunities in my opinion. I would have liked to seen more of Delsin and Reggie's back story and a bit more of an explanation of him being &#34;the second son&#34;. The relationship between these two is fun to watch, but I'd have liked them to have expanded on that, I never really felt like I got to know them.Another interesting thing is that the game play often feels much more like a shooter ala Uncharted/Gears of war than an Infamous game. It's not a bad thing really, but kind of odd at times.I know I had several complaints and if I'd made this review back when I was bored I'd have given it three stars...four at most.But after experiencing the game to it's fullest I have to go ahead and give it a five on Amazon's scale. On a scale from 1-10, it wouldn't get a ten, but it would rank high enough to be a must have for the PS4.", "It can take you a couple of hours into the game to start loving the gameplay but once you start to appreciate the level of detail and funny dialogue inFamous becomes and addictive and fun game. Can't think of how much work went into this game to achieve the simply incredible graphics and smooth actions. First game in ages that I am considering replaying again, this time being a bad ass!", "I was honestly surprised that the seller give me the limited version game fun makes you feel like you want that world to real"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.013304962776601315, 0.0917166918516159, 0.005541629623621702, 0.040012896060943604, 0.12439438700675964, 0.1491151750087738, 0.10779222100973129, 0.08434590697288513, 0.10467315465211868, 0.019420040771365166, 0.0585002675652504, 0.09826889634132385, 0.10291377454996109]]}
