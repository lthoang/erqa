"], "reviews": ["The product did work in my hair in terms of giving it more structure and body, but it didn't feel as natural as I'd prefer.  It felt kind of sticky applying it, and was more stiff once in than I like.  That's all personal preference, but this feels like something I would have used back in the 80's when I was in high school.  I like the newer products that provide hold and body while being less sticky and stiff.A Suave product that I prefer over this one is theirNatural Infusion Awapuhi Ginger and Honeysuckle Light Leave-in Cream.  It's not actually marketed as providing more body, but it does do that with my shorter hair.  I think it has a better scent to it, and it feels more smooth and less sticky.  It will look wet at first, but that mostly goes away once it dries and you comb through it.  It certainly may not work for those of you with longer or fuller hair than I have, but it might if you have shorter hair.", "This, like most Suave products, is an amazing value.  Does everything it says it will do and I cannot imagine my hair washing, conditioning and styling routine without it.  Simple, easy to use pump allows you to dispense just what you need and nothing more.  No waste.  Will I buy this again, you bet.  My hair thanks me for this.", "A few weeks ago I got my hair cut, from very long to an angled shorter style. I also had a ton of layers put into to. So between the layers and my hair already being thick, I have to flat iron my hair and use a few products to help style it. Or else I just end up with a big poof of hair. So I've been using both this Suave leave-in foam and also Dove's Oxygen Moisture Leave In Foam for the past month, to see which I like better. They both keep my hair from being weighted down, but add a little holding product to my hair, so that when I use my flatiron to curl my hair inward, it helps it stay.These leave-in foams are like a lighter version of a mousse, but have a little more style effect than just a spritz of hair spray. They're great for short to medium length hair styles, since they don't weigh the hair down. I find both this Suave leave-in foam and Dove's are similar. However as a person preference, I like the smell of the Dove version a bit better. However if you enjoy the Lotus Blossom like from Suave Professionals, and like to layer those products from that line, you'll really like this Suave leave-in foam.", "Was swinging between rating this product 3 or 4 stars, but decided on the 4. This is NOT a mousse. I got this product to try as an option to hair mousse, which I often use to style my hair and want the style to hold.First off, this is really light on the hair.  It comes out moist just like foamy soap suds and, unfortunately, that's how it feels like when you put it on your hair (one of the reasons I decided on the 4 stars). You don't need a lot and, similar to mousse, I find it's better to put it on the roots only or else it can weigh your hair down, especially if you have long hair (mine is shoulder length). I find this is best to apply on damp hair: if you put it on wet hair, it feels like you need to rinse it off, and if you put it on dry, it doesn't do anything except wet your hair. Once applied, through a couple of days of trial and error, I find it was best if I completely comb the damp hair through then blow dry completely.  Like I mentioned, I wanted this as an alternate to mousse. This product DOES NOT hold a style, BUT it does leave your hair very, very touchably soft and light and bouncy and wonderful smelling the whole day. My hair felt really light and full of body and volume. This volume lasts the whole day EXCEPT if you comb or re-brush or try to restyle your hair during the day.  And because it doesn't hold a style, when the wind blows, the aeriness/volume/body goes with it.  Also, it doesn't hold up too well in heat or humidity. I found this out when I was stuck in a meeting for 2 hours in an overheated, humidified room. It's still winter with below freezing temps where I live right now, so this product worked great. Based on that one day, I'm thinking this will make my hair fall flat when summer gets here, so my suggestion is not to use it in the summer.Finally, you get to notice that you might actually be putting foamy soap on your hair because when I took a shower after the first day I tried this, my wet hair felt like it had residual soap in it, then when I shampooed, my hair foamed up more than usual. So it took quite a bit of extra time to rinse off my hair completely.  Other than that, it really is a great product!", "This seems to have more of a softening effect rather than really adding a whole lot of body. I'm not really sure if that's because my hair is relatively heavy or not, though. The effect is overall kind of nice and I like it, but I'm not sure I like it enough to make it a typical part of my routine. I think it's a good product, but perhaps a little more suited to people with hair that isn't quite as thick and heavy to begin with, so that the product has an easier time doing its job.", "I was pretty disappointed in this product. I really felt like it didn't do anything for me. The smell was okay, not great but not terrible. I put it in and my hair seemed pretty similar to if I had no product in at all. I have long, thick , wavy hair and it didn't help my waves and I still had frizz. This is compared to a different, similar product which put my hair into nicer waves. Maybe for some people's hair it does something, but I just didn't notice much of a difference for me.", "I love Suave but I just can't get onboard with this product.  Smells great but it dispenses like foaming hand soap and the results it gives, I imagine, wouldn't be much different from running hand soap through your hair.  Maybe I just haven't the right hair texture to make this product work (baby fine, pin straight hair) but it just doesn't do anything for me.  It visibly flakes a bit, even when a very small amount is worked through my damp/wet hair and doesn't do much in terms of volume (growing out my blunt bangs, so was in need of a product to lift them up a bit when pinned back) or keeping my fly aways at bay.", "I have baby fine hair and am constantly in search of a product that will add body and volume to my hair. Tried this on wet and dry hair and neither one worked. The smell was a big deterrent for me. Maybe I was just sensitive to it - I don't know - but I didn't like it and could smell it all day. I couldn't wait to wash my hair just to get that smell out.  I guess I'll keep searching...", "I was so disappointed in the fragrance...I honestly thought wow, this is going to smell great...lotus blossom...well, I guess the seaweed over powered it. To me it smells like cheap shaving cream or something, and it sticks with you ALL DAY long!Its not a &#34;foam&#34; like most of us would think, like a shaving cream or a mousse for your hair...its a liquid that the PUMP infuses air and forms it into a really wet foam...hard to explain, its not light and airy, period. I have white hair, naturally wavy and fine, I honestly didn't feel this product did anything to manage my hair. I, myself would not buy this but we all have different tastes, that's why I gave it 3 stars vs.1, probably some people will love the scent and how it manages their hair.", "The scent of this product was o.k., but not as good as some of the higher end products I've tried such as a Nexus styler I recently tried. As for the product itself, I used it precisely as directed. It left my fine hair feeling soft and conditioned. In other words, it was nice as a conditioner yet it weighed my shag hair style down and made getting volume impossible.This just didn't work for me, but it might work for someone with coarser and heavier hair which would probably need some taming. I can see possibilities with this product, but it doesn't work for me.", "Since I have very baby fine and fly away hair, I am always searching for a product that will make my hair look thicker and keep in place ALL day. This Suave does just that. And it does not make my hair stiff or un-natural looking.Note: All is takes is a dime sized amount on your fingers if you have baby fine or thin hair. For me, the first time I used it I placed a quarter sized squirt and it was WAY too much.So the next time that I used it, I use squirted out a dime size on my hand, blended it into my hair and perfect! My hair looked shiner, and best of all thicker and lasted ALL DAY!Bonus thing I like is that it has a clean smell and not overly perfumed. My scalp is sensitive to heavy perfumed products and it will break out in a rash and also itch. No itching or breaking out with this.Highly recommend this product! It is the best styling product I have ever used.", "The Suave Natural Infusion line has no parabens or dyes which is nice. It also has added natural ingredients which is nice as well. This leave-in product has seaweed and lotus blossom which has a pretty heavy floral scent. If you like floral scents then this may be an okay product for you but I can not really get past the scent to even use the product again. I personally hate florals and I know that this is a personal preference so I don't want to give it a bad review for the product itself. Based on the scent, this is a no- go for me.", "I let my mother try this when we we on vacation. She uses all manner of volumizing products and is something of connoisseur by this point. When she saw the Suave name, she was unsure. I was adamant that Suave has radically changed in the last decade. Wow, when she emerged from styling her hair, it was gorgeous ... tons of volume that lasted all day. I can report similar results, but I need very little volume ... her change was much more substantial.Now, there is a little fragrance here (not artificial but as a result of the natural components). It did not bother me a bit ... in fact, I liked it very much. However, my mother, who is sensitive to fragrance had something of an issue with it (nonetheless, she is in the extreme minority, so unless you, too, suffer from fragrance-sensitivity, you will be fine).Highly recommended to those who want a small boost on occasion (like me) or a big boost all the time (like my mom)!! Awesome price, AWESOME product!", "This foam (really a lightweight  mousse) smells lovely and does not leave a scent after drying in the hair. Sadly, it does not offer my hair any noticeable  benefit. I have long,thick,heavy, dry  frizzy hair. The product may work better for ladies with finer hair. May I suggest looking for user reviews that mention your hair type to determine if this product is for your hair type.", "I have very fine, thin short hair, which flies everywhere from the lightest wind. This helps to hold my hair in place without being too stiff or weighing my hair down. It has a nice scent and doesn't make my hair feel dirty or greasy, though it isn't strong enough to hold my very short hair up if I want the spiked look. Other than that, it's great.", "I purchased this product to use on my daughter's hair, and mine. There are changes in both her hair and mine, due to different factors. The end result is severe dryness, and no volume,or body. On my own hair, I applied a small amount and ran it through. My hair was left soft and silky, and keeps in place looking neat and tame on windy days. We get many dust storms in AZ, and the intense heat stays about 8 months of the year.Prior to using this hair foam on my daughter, her hair was severely dry & damaged, due to medications and climate conditions. After I trimmed her hair, I applied a small amount of this foam and ran it through. The end results shows more volume & body to her hair, and easy to manage. Your hair is not left oily, or greasy after applying this foam. But, I did make sure I used a small amount, realizing that's all you need.There were no skin reactions, or allergic reactions with use of this foam. We both have had several sensitivities for many years, prior to using this hair foam, so I made sure I tested for reactions, and were pleased to fine none with this product. For us, this is a bonus.  In addition, this foam has a pleasant, sweet fragrance. My daughter loves the scent, and it's not over-whelming. We will continue use of this product. It's a good price, considering the quality that it delivers. Highly recommended!", "Suave is a nice budget brand that works just as well, if not better, than some of the more expensive brands out there.  This foam has great hold and works really well.  Don't use too much of it because it will make your hair crunchy, a little bit goes a long way.  Recommended.", "Usually I think of &#34;cheap&#34; when I consider Suave products, but this one was excellent! With curly hairstyles, it can maintain the bounciness and shape of the curls, add volume, and look shiny, all without a sticky residue or crispy feeling gels and sprays often create. This product is as good as pricier ones, so great job, Suave!", "I liked the idea of seaweed and lotus blossom, but I wasn't impressed by the product.  I used it both by itself with dry hair that needed a body boost and on wet hair after shampooing.  Neither way was that great.  My hair is thin and sparse, so I thought this might add volume but it weighed down the hair.  I am going back to Viviscal which thickens my hair, fills in the sparse areas and even covers most of the grey.", "First of all I love what this product does for your hair - it really does condition and add incredible shine.  HOWEVER, it is sticky and yucky to touch with your hands, getting it into your hair.  So for shine and condition five stars, for the touch factor - three stars.I used it dry and it was not good - my hair is over processed and generally gross and this product on dry frizzy hair was not good - it was just sticky.I used it on my damp hair and when my hair dried, it was fabulous - nice smell, easy to brush and shiny.There is a light pleasant smell - I don't recognize the scent - it must be the Lotus Blossom.  It fades as your hair dries - so if you do not like scent don't worry - it is not bad.I used it on my daughter's damp hair (she has straight and easily tangled hair) and the shine after blow dry was blinding.  The next morning her hair brushed straight through without any tangles or pain of knotting.Take-away - we really like it on damp hair as a supplement to our rinse off conditioner.  You need to have a sink near by to wash the sticky off your hands.  If you have over processed hair - not so good to use this product on it dry.", "I use Suave kid's cherry vanilla scented mousse for my son's hair and his product seems eerily similar in appearance.  The first 4 main ingredients of each product were the same and the rest of them were similar.Basically the kid's mousse is mousse without alcohol in it... so it's texture is a less dense foam than regular mouse.  More like soap bubbles than shaving cream.  This product does not advertize itself as mousse, rather as a &#34;leave in foam&#34;.  But in reality I think they are basically the same thing... just marketed differently with different perfume scents.  Price wise- this is more expensive than the kid's mousse (which I have used on my own hair because it's less sticky), but they work the same.If you are not one who cares about labels or need a specific adult-smelling product and you want to try this stuff... maybe you should try the Suave Kid's Mousse first.That being said this IS a good product.  It is less sticky than regular mousse, and doesn't feel as weighty.  You don't have that crunchy feeling either if you use a lot of it.  So that is why I am giving 4 stars.  I just felt like I should point out the other stuff.", "I love this product.  It's almost weightless, yet it keeps my very long hair sleek.  I use three pumps on wet hair before blow drying.  The real test is that I don't dry my hair all the way.  If a product makes my hair look good under those conditions, it's a great one.This one does.  There's no obnoxious fragrance, my hair doesn't look poofy or stiff; it just looks better with than without it.  Yay!", "I really like this product. Not only does it smell great it gives my hair body without weighing it down. I have really thin hair. I need products to give it body. This product works great. After towel drying I put about four pumps into my hair, and let air dry or blow dry- My hair has body and again like the smell.Suave has come out with some great product recently for body for my thin hair- This product doesn't disappoint.", "This goes on like a mousse.  It smells nice to me, though this is not as strongly scented as the regular conditioner.  I think it's rather a feminine scent.  I use about 8 squirts on my hair, which is waist length.  When I first put it on, it makes it feel like I still have soap in my hair - that's the only thing I don't like much about it, but it's worth it.It's easy to apply and rinses off my hands easily - it doesn't leave my hands feeling yucky or sticky.It takes my hair a bit longer to dry with this in - I like to let my hair just air dry overnight usually.  When my hair is dry, it is wavy, has lots of volume, and it's very soft and shiny.The scent doesn't last long - I prefer the way the regular conditioner scents my hair.This seems to tame my flyaways though, and it thickens my hair and well, works wonderfully - as good or better than some $20+ products I've used.For me, this is a keeper. I've really enjoyed several products in this line I've tried.", "We've used lots of Suave products around our house through the years, most with good results.  First off, I absolutely could not stand the smell of this.  I expected lotus blossom to be a botanical scent, but to me it just seemed strong and sort of like alcohol or an astringent scent.  It is a light mousse, with a good consistency, not nearly as heavy or greasy seeming as some products.  However, when adding to my hair, I really felt like it just weighed it down, and made it seem greasier and flat.  I have very thick hair, with just a bit of a wave, and I was hoping for a lift in the crown area and some shine.  Some reviewers really like it, so it may depend on your own hair type.  Just didn't do anything positive for me.", "I like that this foam doesn't have parabens or dyes. The scent is nice and it did give my hair extra body. I felt it was a little bit of a sticky/stiff hold, not as natural as some other products I've used, but it's possible that I just used too much. Overall it's a very nice styling aid.", "I have fine, curly hair and have to be careful that products I choose don't weight it down and make it look dirty.  I hardly ever use conditioner for that reason.  I like the idea that this product is paraben-free, and I like some of the other products in the Suave Professional line.I applied 4 pumps of this foam to my hair after shampooing, combed through, scrunched and allowed it to air dry. I did notice more fullness and bounce, but my hair had a wet look like gels give it.  It was also drier than usual, and was less silky when I wet-combed it, like it needed some oil or conditioner.  And like some of the other reviewers mentioned, it smells funny.  Next time I'll use some anti-frizz serum before this product and see if that helps.This is a pretty good product, and one you'll love if it suits your hair type.  I will probably finish this bottle, but won't buy it again.", "Using it according to directions left it pleasantly fragrant, touchably soft with some volume. The Texas drizzle and humidity turned my naturally wavy, curly hair into an object for experimentation. Was this hairdo salvageable?  A messy bun 'do was in order.I do not wash my hair everyday. Day 2 -  I went with hot rollers for pageant poofy hair. Day 3 -  I spritz'd it with water and pincurled  it for beachy waves for a casual look.Then I washed and tried the product again with LESS product and better results. I'd say give it a try over a weekend and experiment with it. DO NOT just use it according to directions and expect perfection. IF you get perfection first time out, thank your lucky stars. The unpredictabilty factor may be due to my hair type AND Texas weather. I'm not sure how this will hold up during the Texas summer. I'm thinking a whole other batch of experiments will be required.You've been warned!", "I have to admit I only used this once and it did a nice job on my hair.  Flyaways were controlled and I had shiny, manageble hair that still looked good when I got up the next day.  However, I took away two stars because I could NOT get this stuff off my hands.  I followed the instructions and put a small amount in the palm of my and and then worked it through my hair from the roots out.  Then I washed my hands.  Then I washed them again.  I styled my hair and noticed the hairdryer was sticking to my hands so I washed the AGAIN.  An hour later and my hands STILL felt sticky so I scrubbed and used stronger soap and still there was residue.", "This is an absolutely terrific mousse. Just a few pumps of the product pulled through my hair from roots to tips, gave me incredible control and volume. No flyaways either, and I have wavy hair, so that was noticeable. My hair felt clean and shiny and a little swingy all day. And the product smells wonderful, like a quality salon product. Love it.Recommendation: Absolutely. Terrific product.", "I wouldn't call this product description &#34;misleading&#34; necessarily, but the fact that Suave has released a ton of new hair products and that this is called a &#34;leave in&#34; foam might suggest that this is more than it is. This is essentially a substitute for hairspray or gel. It doesn't do much for your overall hair.The &#34;leave in&#34; is the questionable part as it suggests that there's an alternative. There isn't. Leaving it in is what this should be used for and not much else.My hair does feel good after using this. I suppose that's a plus. It definitely doesn't feel bad. If you're looking for a product to help with flyaways, this is definitely worth a try. I like it as an alternative to gel Just don't expect that this will do anything more.", "I was a little apprehensive about using a product that had &#34;seaweed&#34; in the title (I've smelled seaweed and it isn't a scent I would want in my hair), but it smells really nice (probably the lotus). The directions for this foam say that it can be used for volume or just to tame flyways. I like the latter option best. I was using styling gel to keep my hair smooth, but it made my hair kind of crackly. This foam works without any negative effect. I barely even notice it in my hair.I also tried to use to add volume to my hair with moderate success. My hair is quite long, so I had to put more than the recommended number of pumps."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.017177850008010864, 0.033548399806022644, 0.025469589978456497, 0.031114742159843445, 0.03466885909438133, 0.032099079340696335, 0.030462509021162987, 0.03332928940653801, 0.03210756927728653, 0.03033154271543026, 0.03427999094128609, 0.031144101172685623, 0.03004257008433342, 0.030525313690304756, 0.030544361099600792, 0.028049811720848083, 0.030573038384318352, 0.03070361725986004, 0.028152242302894592, 0.033773016184568405, 0.032222479581832886, 0.029355529695749283, 0.03548199310898781, 0.05243169516324997, 0.03223509341478348, 0.032320521771907806, 0.027942199259996414, 0.020870765671133995, 0.03002728335559368, 0.03163794428110123, 0.033128540962934494, 0.0342484712600708]]}
