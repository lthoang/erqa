"], "reviews": ["Several years ago I went for a shorter, wash and go hairstyle.  My only problem with this type hair style was living in a Southern Part of the US that has high humidity levels which causes my hair to be frizzy and fly-away.  I used this shampoo a couple of times before theSuave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Conditioner, 12.6 OunceI ordered arrived.  While my hair smelled wonderful and was softer I still needed a conditioner to bring my hair under control. I used a conditioner that I already had on hand,Dove Oxygen Moisture Conditioner, 12 Ounce, and it worked okay.  When I received theSuave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Conditioner, 12.6 Ounceand used it with this shampoo my hair was much softer and easier to manage.I love the fragrance of this shampoo.  If you can imagine a floral scent (similar to Magnolia) with a slight almond (nut) fragrance.  It's not overpowering and doesn't bother my allergies as some fragrances, especially floral, cause me to have headaches.", "I'm not the kind of person that likes all of the fruity fragrances that are in a lot of shampoos these days.  Vanilla is OK, apples...not so much.  I generally like to smell the shampoo before I buy it, but since I ordered it online I didn't have that experience prior to receiving it.I'm happy to say that this shampoo doesn't smell like a fruit basket, but has a very pleasing and not overwhelming fragrance.  I also really like that it doesn't have any parabans or dyes...I just wish that Suave would have taken it one step further and also made the shampoo without sulfates.  I had a shampoo that was sulfate free, as well as paraben and dye free and loved my hair when I used it.  Unfortunately, it was also fairly expensive so I decide to try this new Suave Professionals line.My hair does feel soft, though I've noticed that my hair is much frizzier from using this shampoo.  Part of that may be that I am not using the companion conditioner (my previous shampoo was a shampoo/conditioner so I didn't have any on hand) I love the fragrance and it seems to wash out fairly easily.  I have a lot of hair so sometimes that's a problem for me and if doesn't all rinse out then it can leave a residue.In the end.  It's a shampoo.  It's very reasonably priced, and for what you pay I do think it's a great value.  It does it's job, smells really nice, but I miss my other shampoo terribly.  So while it does have a lot of positives about it, I will be going back to my more expensive paraben, sulfate and dye free shampoo.  I don't regret giving it a go though.  If you are on the fence about it I think it's definitely worth a try.", "I find myself looking even more forward to washing my yard long hair than ever! Suave Professional Line really leaves hair feeling great with the shampoos acting almost like conditioners. And the smell....mmmmmm!", "This shampoo works fine. It has a pleasant but not overpowering scent and leaves my hair very soft and smooth. I was unhappy by how &#34;unnatural&#34; the ingredients were though - - very heavy on the chemicals for a shampoo with the word natural in the title. It makes me feel like it's trying to deceive the consumer.", "You don't have to use much to get a good clean, and its light fragrance smells so good!  Leaves my hair feeling light and fresh, and it's shiny too.", "This particular shampoo from Suave is very similar to their other shampoos that are similarly packaged in the gold bottles.  It gently cleanses the hair without stripping it and leaves the hair soft and silky.  However, if your scalp is extra oily or sweaty from an outdoor activity or from working out, a repeat wash is needed.  The scent is a light floral with sandalwood-like base tone.  The scent does last throughout most of the day.Recommended for those looking for a gentle shampoo.", "I'll start with the practical aspects of this product and then get down to the possible hazards.When used with Suave's matching conditioner, this shampoo leaves my hair manageable. However, when I left out the conditioner, the shampoo left my hair stringy-looking.The scent is light and not obnoxious. I prefer unscented products because I have allergies, but this fragrance did not seem to cause problems (unless I'm wrong about my itchy eyes being irritated by the pollen of nearby trees - I suppose it could be due to this product; too soon to say).Here's a suggestion for Suave: Make the word Shampoo large on the bottle because it's easy to confuse this one with the identical-looking conditioner. Most people don't wear glasses while washing their hair!Now for the negative chemical stuff: Like the conditioner, the shampoo contains some undesirable chemicals. Don't be fooled by the word &#34;Natural&#34; -- it's hype! Here are the ingredients that are of most concern according to EWG's Skin Deep Cosmetics Database:1. DMDM HYDANTOIN (FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER) - an irritant, and not good for the aldehyde-sensitive.2. METHYLISOTHIAZOLINONE - Neurotoxic and an irritant3. METHYLCHLOROISOTHIAZOLINONE - Possible carcinogen, allergen, and a stressor on the environment.In fairness, most hair products contain stuff that's bad for you or the environment. I find myself unable to use most of the really natural ones because I'm allergic to aloe, so I experiment with products trying to find one that's good for my hair but still totally safe. I'm still looking.", "If you're like me and trying desperately to find hair products that will clean all the sweat and dirt boy's sports can inflict upon a head of hair, then look no further!  This stuff cleans like none other - gets clear down to the scalp and leaves the hair soft and fresh.  The boy's love it - smells pretty awesome around here during shower time too!  We have the matching conditioner as well and it really is great.  It has been my experience that these Naturals are just that - natural, and do a far, far better job at cleaning than their counterparts.  Plus, they don't make your hair look like a dry box of soda crackers when you're done either!HIGHLY recommend!", "There are a couple of things I liked about this shampoo. It has a nice smell to it that is not too strong and not too feminine, just a little flowery but very clean smelling. It lingers for a while without overpowering you or the folks around you. Secondly, it lathers up very nicely and gets down to the scalp, noticeably cleaning on the way, but then it rinses completely away leaving hair smooth and soft. The consistency is a little oily for me, which is why I use it only occasionally, but it makes my hair feel so soft, I don&#8217;t really feel a need for conditioning after shampooing. I have a bit of a nut allergy and was a little afraid the macadamia oil might cause some problems, but it did not. So when you get down to it, this is a nice, fragrant, effective shampoo that I have only minor inconsequential &#8220;don&#8217;t likes&#8221; about, which is why I give it four stars.", "Suave is a great, inexpensive brand that works just as well (if not better) than pricier brands out there.  This shampoo smells and works great.", "This product works great. It has a rich, sweet smell (but not too sweet!) and lathers up nicely. It's also very moisturizing, so it doesn't dry out your scalp. Only use a teaspoon's worth, tho, because it does lather up easily.", "\"This shampoo, Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid, has a great scent and really bubbles up! It is not harsh in the least however. As well, it actually has a light \"\"leave in conditioner\"\" available here (last time I looked) which you can buy to match the fragrance of this shampoo. I use them both together!I live in New York, which I am beginning to think is never going to warm up (we have temperatures twenty degrees below normal today). Arguably the next best thing to booking a flight across the country is to get in a wonderful comforting shower and pretend you are in the state of Hawaii, which of course has all those yummy Macadamia nuts and all those beautiful Orchids!  Try taking a trip in your mind by using power of Suave!  This product's smell isn't so strong that you will have a fragrance fight on your hands concerining the perfume (or body lotion)  you may choose after your shower. In fact, my 23 year old son tried this shampoo last night and was very happy with the results on his long hair. He didn't say a word about the smell.I do believe in the positive benefits of aromatherapy, however I am no expert.Then again, I cannot imagine anyone not liking the smell of this!Additionally, if you like to pamper yourself with your shampoo choices, but don't want to spend zillions of bucks on the fancier spa brands, go for Suave. I do, every single time!thanks and Aloha!jean\"", "This shampoo smells great and leaves your hair feeling silky and smooth. I almost feel like I don't need conditioner afterwards, I would definitely recommend and buy again.", "A notch up from market brand Suave shampoo.  Tried to get my husband to try it, but he is stuck on the coconut one.  I like this shampoo, but I am hooked on Nexxus.  You can use it with a change in shampoo/then conditioning treatment of your choice.  I use a harsher shampoo every so often to wash out residue from the other shampoo I have.  Nice product, but not like mine.", "While I love the smell and luxurious feel of Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Shampoo, it leaves my curly hair flat. And while somedays I might want to flatten my hair, most days I want my curls. So, I can only give this product 3 stars for that reason. However, if you don't have curly hair, this would be a great treatment as it does leave hair silky and smooth.", "I love Suave products. The quality is always great, and the price is so much more affordable than higher end styling products.This Suave Professionals does a great job of moisturizing my daughter's hair. Her hair tends to be dry and frizzy. The Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and Whit Orchid shampoo helps to tame the frizz by moisturizing her hair. It smells great too.We love the whole family of Suave products and this Professionals shampoo is a great addition to the Suave family.", "First of all, this shampoo smells fabulous. Orchid is a new favorite scent of mine. I'm surprised it hasn't been done yet. As I used it I was nearly tempted to act like those ladies in the shower in the old Herbal Essences commercials. LOLThat being said, I will buy this. One thing that's important to me is that it's safe for color-treated hair. As someone who gets her dyed once a month, this is super important to me. You don't want your hair stripped, not after the expensive dye jobs, and I'm pleased to say my hair did NOT lose its luster, shine, or color when using this shampoo. As a matter of fact, it made my hair feel thicker and I did not need to use a conditioner with it.Highly recommend. It's a great product and a lot cheaper than salon shampoos. And the smell....whoooeeee!", "I have noticed that shampoos get their share of five star reviews and one star reviews.  I have come to the conclusion that everyone has a certain body chemistry that works well with certain kinds of shampoo, and not so well with others.  Having said that, this shampoo seems like a very nice one for us.We like the scent and the way it lathers in use.  We absolutely love how thick and rich the shampoo feels.  Indeed, our regular shampoo almost feels watery in comparison.  Yes, this shampoo also cleans well, and seems as though it leaves our hair feeling moist and thick, along with the great scent.You may almost feel as though you are at an expensive tropical spa when you use this shampoo!Enjoy!", "Not sure what there is about this formula that messed with my allergies.  I have been allergic to eating Macadamia nuts in the past but didn't really think topically applying an oil of them would make me sneeze?  Other than that I liked how the formula rinsed out easily and left my hair manageable (almost to the point I think I could have skipped a conditioner).  If you have a nut (or nut oil) allergy than proceed with caution.  Otherwise it is a great product.Edited:  Changed stars to 4.  The product did a great job..it isn't the product's fault I am allergic to Macadamia nuts.", "Let's be realistic -- Suave is generally considered to be in the lower price category and is often looked down upon by those using expensive salon variations.Well, guess I'm not one of those that looks down at Suave since it does the job for less than 25% of the price (in most cases).Since I have light, flyaway, hair a decent conditioner addition is always welcome and this formulation manages to clean my hair and keep it manageable without weighing it down excessively.And the smell isn't bad, either.  My other half states it smells something like a Pina Colada and that ain't all bad!", "This has no gluten ingredients. (Suave will identify them, clearly, on any labeling.) It smooths out frizz without darkening or changing the color of light-colored hair. It's also made in the U.S.A., and its main manufacturer, the Lever corporation, has a commitment to environmentally responsible manufacturing and packaging.(For reference, I have Scots/Northern England ancestry and naturally red, curly hair, complicated by just enough West and Sub-Saharan African ancestry to give me some resistance to malaria, and way-too-frizzy hair.)  This shampoo smooths out the frizz without adding weight or grease. It also doesn't have an unpleasantly strong aroma, although it does have a nice smell.One caveat:  keep it away from dogs. There is a fair amount of yummy-smelling macadamia oil in this, and macadamia nuts can cause a fatal psychosis in canines.", "This shampoo has no parabens and no dyes, but its main ingredients are water and petroleum derivatives, like most shampoos. With that said, it's a good shampoo. The texture in use is unusually silky, the scent is lush but not lingering (so it won't fight with your perfume), and it leaves your hair clean and healthy.If you have both males and females in your household, you probably need to keep this for the girls and get the guys something with a less feminine scent.", "As a Shampoo, this product gets the job done.I was particularly excited to try THIS product because of the Macadamia Oil and White Orchid. I thought this product would smell like tropical paradise. Instead, I get a Musky scent that turns my stomach.Now, some people LOVE Musky scents. So, this product would be for you!The scent is subtle enough, but I just can't stand this smell.In retrospect, I should have gone to the store and seen if I could smell it. But I didn't think it was necessary for White Orchid. Oh well.I know that LOTS of folks out there will love this scent. It's just not for me. Remember, I stated that the shampoo is good. But I can't get past the scent to use it up. I will give it to a friend. And if they like it, I will let you know.", "I should begin by saying that I am an enormous fan of the &#34;infusion&#34; line by Suave. The Morroccan infusion line is a favorite of mine and I was really looking forward to trying this, but the perfume scent was very, very strong. What was worse was that it lingered the next day. I only wash my hair every other day and when I got it wet and conditioned it, the strong perfume scent re-asserted itself. I was also disappointed to find that this left my head feeling itchy the next day (I wash at night). I guess it's just not playing well with my body chemistry. Usually, Suave's shampoo works a dream for me, but this one did not.", "On the positive side, this is a very pleasantly scented shampoo--not overwhelming or headache inducing.  It lathers nicely in the hair as well, not becoming overly soapy or needing tons to get a lather.  However,  the results are not really anything grand.  It will be another week or so until I can be certain, but this shampoo appears to weigh down my fine hair a lot more, which means more of it may be staying in my hair after I've rinsed.The actual shampoo is also a little watery, and it's easy to pour out too much at once and waste it if you're not careful. (My shampoo must have leaked in shipment because their was a long line of crusted goop on the side when I received the package.I don't think this will be a repeat for me--there are other shampoos that have worked better overall.Happy Bathing! ^_^ Shanshad", "For me, a shampoo is only as good as the conditioner that comes after it. I absolutely love what the Macadamia/White Orchid conditioner does for my hair, and I adore the scent, so naturally I love this shampoo that goes with it. What I have found with the shampoos in this product line is that they don't lather up as well as some other shampoos. That's not a big problem for me. I just have to use a wee bit more and put some extra effort into getting it all the way through my hair.I'm generally quite sensitive to artificial fragrances. Some of them make me sneeze, make my nose run and my eyes water, and/or give me a sore throat. For some reason, the products in this Natural Infusion line do not affect me that way. Make no mistake, the smell of this shampoo and conditioner is quite potent, but it's a scent I enjoy, and it doesn't linger cloyingly after my hair is dry.If you're concerned about fragrance, I recommend going into a store where the products are sold and giving them the sniff test. They will smell quite strong when you put your nose up to the bottle, and slightly less so when you use them. I have also used and love the Awapuhi/Ginger/Honeysuckle shampoo and conditioner in this line. If you want a slightly less potent fragrance, I suggest trying that scent rather than this stronger White Orchid one.", "Suave Professionals Natural Infusion Macadamia Oil and White Orchid Shampoo cleanses well.  There's not too much lather that strips hair of natural oils.  I do like that.  Although it usually means that I need to wash my hair more often.  Using this product, my hair is shiny and soft.  The only thing I'm not crazy about is the fragrance.  It's a musky sort of scent, and I usually prefer a more citrusy aroma.The smell doesn't linger outside of the bath, so I have no problem using this product.", "I love this shampoo.  It leaves my dry curly hair soft and manageable.  I don't need a lot to get a nice lather, and it feels amazing when I'm are washing my hair.  The only descriptive word I can think of is &#34;silky.&#34;  My fingers just glide through my hair.  I was tempted not to use a conditioner, because it felt so soft and manageable - but decided against that idea.  It also has a wonderful scent.  My husband loves to smell my hair when I use this shampoo.  I'm going to try the conditioner.", "I love the smell of this shampoo! Not fruity, or too sweet. Not overly scented, or perfumey. It really makes my hair soft and manageable, and the ends aren't so dry. My hair is easy to comb out when it's wet, and doesn't get as tangled when it's dry. In fact, I like it so well, I bought the conditioner, which also works very well. Unfortunately, when I use the shampoo and conditioner together, my hair is so soft, it's flat. It doesn't appear greasy, it's just not fluffy and lively. I've combined them with other shampoos and conditioners, and I do like the outcome better than when I use them together.If you have coarse hair that you would like to tame, I think this shampoo would work very well for you, but it might be too much for fine or thin hair. The only way to know, of course, is to give it a try. I am going to continue to use it, but with other conditioners.", "\"Having used and really liked the White Orchid and Macadamia Oil conditioner, jumped at the chance to give this shampoo a whirl.  Have dry and bleached hair that needs special care, so a moisturizing shampoo is just what this old broad needs.  Shampoo has the same appealing fragrance as the conditioner, and it did a nice job of cleaning my hair without leaving it stripped.  Afterwards used the related conditioner, and my hair was left seductively smooth and soft.  Also, found my mop was very easy to manage and required only a very minimal blow dry and a few swipes of ironing.  Voila!Suave used to be known as a \"\"bargain basement brand.\"\"  You know that stuff you found on the bottom shelf?  But no more!  Suave's stepped into the limelight with these salon knockoffs, and people who are counting their pennies (which these days is just about everyone) are getting hip to the deal/steal that Suave's products have become.\"", "I am currently using this shampoo with the conditioner of its kind.  I like the scent very much and the softness it gives to my hair.  My hair is very dry right now due the long winter season and this shampoo has helped with the lack of shine.  My hair is fine-med texture and is a couple of inches below my shoulders.  It's wavy and sometimes too much oil in a shampoo can easily weigh it down.  This shampoo is sort of creamy yet not too heavy for my hair.  I don&#8217;t recommend this for very fine hair or oily hair.  So far it&#8217;s working for my needs.", "A very gentle, pleasant scent that remain subtle when hair is dry.Very soapy, only need a little as it goes a long way and we have very hard water but this shampoo lathers really well.Gentle clean, no residue left and leaves hair light and shiny.A nice sized bottle too, that isn't bulky or awkward to pour, dispenses cleanly from small opening.Good product."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.02611926756799221, 0.02443482168018818, 0.029744138941168785, 0.03327229991555214, 0.0331149660050869, 0.033250827342271805, 0.03232606500387192, 0.033561769872903824, 0.03023560531437397, 0.031255532056093216, 0.034254979342222214, 0.031331486999988556, 0.03395653888583183, 0.0291880015283823, 0.034547388553619385, 0.03252863138914108, 0.03309196978807449, 0.030780475586652756, 0.027904460206627846, 0.03289959579706192, 0.02618696726858616, 0.03164743632078171, 0.034933291375637054, 0.030977755784988403, 0.03287491574883461, 0.030004050582647324, 0.03050067089498043, 0.0334521047770977, 0.028344709426164627, 0.030858278274536133, 0.031633079051971436, 0.03078792616724968]]}
