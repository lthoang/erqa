"], "reviews": ["This is a great peppermint tea. You know this is peppermint. You don't have to use your imagination to taste it. I liked it hot or iced, but hot typically brings out more of the peppermintiness. Still, I love this iced, very refreshing in a natural way. The peppermint flavor is so strong, I blended this with a mild black tea, iced them, and the peppermint still dominated.The Green Tea here is a guest star. They are not on equal footing. The taste test is verified by the ingredients, 1020mg of organic peppermint leaf and 480mg of organic green tea leaf. Per the container, each tea bag has about 12mg of caffeine (from the green tea), so this is very mild.The brewing instructions are different than usual here. The container recommends steeping 10-15 minutes covered. 8oz of boiling water over the tea bag. And squeeze the teabag in the cup after brewing. I am typically able to squeeze two cups out of a typical tea bag. In this case, I was able to squeeze three cups. Obviously subsequent cups are not as strong, but still, why waste it?Each teabag is sealed in its envelope in a tamper proof fashion - you have to tear off the top of the envelope to get to the tea bag. This is great if you don't feel comfortable with naked tea bags or you want to give friends a few tea bags so they can try it on their own. There's a nice peppermint smell when you open each teabag. The box that contains the teabags is nicely designed with an earthy style and even has a &#34;Best If Used By&#34; date in human readable form (eg FEB2017). There are 16 individual teabags in the box.So why four stars? Pet peeve and soap box time. Each tea bag has not one but TWO staples. One on the teabag and one where the string is attached to the square paper holder. The year is 2014, can we please stop putting staples on tea bags? Who wants to drink staple juice anyway? I remove one star for this.", "I love green tea and peppermint is one of my favorite regular tea flavors so this combo really appealed to me.  It is light on green tea flavor and you have to love mint, but for those that do it is really refreshing.  I am very pleased with this tea, which is also organic.  I plan to purchase the 6 boxes because between hubby, me and work I think the price also can't be beat.  I would have to say this is my favorite peppermint tea at the moment and perfect for any time of the day.  It would also be delicious and refreshing iced.  Overall, no complaints here.  Highly recommended from a daily tea drinker!", "This is a well made tea. Somehow Traditional Medicinals was able to take the green tea sourness out of this tea blend. The tea bags smells nice and sweet even in their foil wrappers.After the tea is brewed I can feel the hot spicy peppery bite in each sip. After swallowing there is a faint minty aftertaste. Other than the pepper heat the tea has very little taste.Make sure to take the staples out before you try and compost the bags.", "I have been drinking Traditional Medicinals teas for over 40 years. I swear by Mother Nature to provide me with a natural remedy whenever my body is in a state of disharmony. Traditional Medicinals serves Mother Nature well by providing us with a simple and inexpensive herbal alternative to over-the-counter pharmaceutical medicines.This new organic Green tea with essential peppermint oil is a must-have in my herbal arsenal. Not only is it delicious...it is refreshing, uplifting, soothing, tonifying and nourishing.Peppermint is my favorite remedy for my frequent bouts of indigestion.

It also aids in weight loss inasmuch as it promotes the burning of fat to help regulate blood sugar and insulin levels.This Traditional Medicinals combination of green tea and peppermint is lovely.

A cup of this tea is a delightful way to benefit from the provisions of Mother Nature and achieving more harmony of health. It has become my favorite tea.", "Well, just to give any readers a full disclosure, let me state outright that I'm not too fond of green tea.  In fact, I have tons of different kinds of tea and herbal &#8220;teas&#8221; (yes, I know brewed herbs are technically tisanes and not &#8220;tea&#8221;), but the one thing I don't keep on hand is green tea, because I don't care for its flavor.  However, when I saw this item that combines green tea and peppermint, I thought, &#8220;why not?&#8221;  The great thing about peppermint is that its strongly flavored, and might make the green tea more palatable...The first thing I did when I got my tea in the mail was to open it up and sniff a tea bag.  It smells strongly of peppermint, with no real hint of green tea.  I chose to brew mine for 10 minutes, and after tasting it hot, I can say that the green tea is definitely subtle.  In fact, I almost wouldn't know that it wasn't plain peppermint tea.  It tastes almost exactly like normal peppermint, with only a tiny hint of &#8220;something else&#8221; in there.  Once I let it cool in the fridge and tried it iced, it tasted about the same.So, I can safely recommend this tea to someone who doesn't really care for green tea, but might be interesting in drinking it for health benefits or some such since you really can't taste it.  However, if you were really hoping that the green tea flavor was prominent with only a hint of peppermint, well, unfortunately, you'll be out of luck with this product.  In fact, if that's your situation, I'd suggest buying some loose leaf green tea and peppermint (easy enough to find) and making your own little mix.  As it is, this tea is decent enough for my needs, so I'm pretty pleased with it!", "Evenings, I often have a debate with myself.  Do I want peppermint tea with great peppermint flavor or green tea with a modest amount of caffeine. Now, I can have both at once.  Of course, the peppermint flavor is dominant, but I find this combination to be just right.", "Five FLAVORFUL Stars! This Traditional Medicinals company Green Tea Peppermint package contains 16 individually wrapped tea bags each of which deliver a very pleasant cup of organic tea which is heavily flavored with the taste of peppermint. In fact, in each cup the scale is tipped in 'flavor' of peppermint: 1020 mg of organic peppermint leaf and 480 mg of organic green tea leaf per bag, as well as 12 mg of naturally occurring caffeine.Each bag is to be steeped in 8 ounces of hot water for 10-15 minutes.  Traditonal Medicinals says the product soothes the digestive tract, but advises users to consult their healthcare practitioner before use in case of gallstones, bile duct obstruction, hietal hernias, acid reflux, and pregnancy/breastfeeding. With these limitations in mind, this flavor tea product, high in peppermin essential oil and with the touted benefits of green tea is Highly Recommended. Five TASTY Stars! (1 box of organic Green Tea Peppermint Tea containing 16 bags)", "I love almost anything with peppermint and became a fan of peppermint tea a few years ago. Last year, I was able to try the Higgins & Burke peppermint tea through Vine, and loved it so much, I began ordering it. When I saw this organic peppermint tea, I grabbed it right away, without noticing it's a green tea. I generally don't like green tea and I have to avoid caffeine due to tachycardia.So I was hesitant to try this, but another viewer mentioned it only has 12 mg of caffeine, about the amount in an ounce of dark chocolate (which I eat all the time). And yet another said the green tea flavor was mild. So I gave it a shot.I was very pleasantly surprised. This tea is very refreshing, with a nice mint flavor. I didn't notice a green tea taste at all. I sweetened it with about 10 drops of liquid Stevia and it was perfect. You could drink it hot or cold and still enjoy it. I've had three cups so far and haven't been bothered by the minimal amount of caffeine (I have been groggy this afternoon, so it's definitely not enough to perk you up).My only complaint is that one of the three bags I've used so far wasn't well sealed, and the tea leaves spilled into the cup. I had to strain it into another cup but still had several bits of tea in my mug. This happens on occasion with any stapled tea bag, though.If you are a tea lover, and a peppermint lover, or even better, a peppermint tea lover, definitely give the Traditional Medicinals tea a try. It and the Higgins-Burke have much more flavor than the typical herbal teas you can find at the grocery store. Let it steep for several minutes for maximum flavor.
