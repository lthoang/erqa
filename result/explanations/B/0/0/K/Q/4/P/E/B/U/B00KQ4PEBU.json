It absorbs quickly and helps my face to look better and healthier. I like the positive results that this Serum bring to my skin.", "I wouldn't say that it is the best nor the worst serum I have used. I personally though am not a fan of the smell that it has to it or the way my doesn't feel any different after several uses. While this product didn't work out for me it doesn't mean that it won't work out with you. You can read my full review here on my blog:http://acountrygirlcanreviews.blogspot.com/2014/07/day-by-day-hyaluronic-acid-serum-for.htmlI do plan to pass this off to my mom and report back about her experience", "I loved that this serum was thicker in consistency then some of the most recent serums I have tried. The serum was like a gel and it was clear in color. It did have a very faint scent, almost like an alcohol smell... I personally didn't like that, but as I applied it, the scent did dissipate fairly quickly. It's very light going on and because it has a gel like consistency, it glides on your face and neck very easily. My face doesn't feel greasy or heavy after use. The bottle is small, but a little really does go a long way. The one thing I really liked about the serum is that it contains witch hazel (which is probably where the alcohol scent come from). Some people don't like witch hazel because it is sometimes known to dry out the skin, but this is why I personally liked it... I have very oily skin, so I regularly use witch hazel any ways to help with my skin not look so shiny. If you have dry skin, then you might need a moisturizer after using this product. But, even though I have only used this product for a few weeks, it has seem to help keep my skin tone even and it gave my complexion a nice &#34;glow&#34;. I have yet to see any difference in the appearance of my fine lines and pore sizes, but I am hopeful with more use, I might.Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.", "Hyaluronic Acid Serum can deliver beautiful results when used daily as part of a regular skin care regimen. Day By Day has done a wonderful job packaging up this magic in a bottle! It is not greasy or smelly. Works wonderful day or night if you need a little more of a boost to your dull skin. I can't say enough good about this product! I have sensitive skin & it didn't bother me at all.! 5 of 5 stars for sure!", "I have been dying to try hyaluronic acid (HA) for the longest but was afraid of all the companies that add fillers and binders to it.  However with that being said, I first read the ingredient list before trying it out. This serum comes infused with Vitamin C and E in a small size bottle. Vitamin C is awesome as a topical serum for the face and have many lovely properties to it. It comes with a security seal at the top of the bottle plus the pump is enclosed in a plastic bag for leak proof shipping.The serum is gel like with a clear color. It has very little to no order and doesn't feel greasy or heavy after application. The bottle I will admit is small, but a little does go a look way. Since it is a gel like consistency, it glides over your face with no problem and spreads easy and thinly.Now for all those who have no clue what hyaluronic acid is, allow me to elaborate.  Hyaluronic Acid (HA) is found naturally in the human body and seen in high dosages in babies.  Ever wondered why babies and small children always look like they have beautiful supple plumply skin? Well its because of the hyaluronic acid in their system. Its a major component of skin tissue that give babies this beautiful plushy effect. Skin in general holds about fifty percent of your body&#8217;s hyaluronic acid in it. However as we get older we lose a lot of it and thus aging takes it toll. Hyaluronic Acid plumps and moisturizes skin as well as it helps to heal and comfort it when its suffered damage. Hyaluronic Acid also prevent fine lines and wrinkles from forming and helps by retaining moisture in the skin and creating a cushion like effect to help plump out the lines as we age.I have been using this serum for almost three weeks now and I have to say I amazed by the benefits I have gotten from it. This serum helps to even out skin tone, plump up the skin and give a nice glowy complexion. It didn't irritate my face and the smell which was very light and faint dissipated very quickly.The ONLY thing I didn't like about this serum is that it contains witch hazel and if you read my beauty blog you know I don't like using anything with witch hazel in it.  Witch hazel and alochol dry out the skin and in my opinion have no place in skincare products.  However I will give the company the benefit of the doubt for the moment.  Nonetheless I believe there are better products out to substitute for witch hazel. So while this product is great, I am not sure I would re-buy it simply because of the witch hazel. However everything else sold me!  Nonetheless if you don't mind witch hazel in your products, then this is for sure for you!The only reason I gave this a 4 stars and not a 5 is because of the witch hazel! Outside of that this product is really worth the buy!", "By now I think most of you have heard about how great Hyaluronic Acid is.  I had heard of it several years ago, but never really had the chance to try it until doing product reviews.  The Day By Day Beauty packaging caught my eye instantly, bright blue and the silver color is perfectly matched to the beautiful serum inside the bottle!  I don't know how such an amazing product can come in such a small jar.  I received a 1 fl. oz. bottle to test and although it doesn't seem like much, it's a good size jar and I can imagine would last you for months because it really does not take much of this serum at all.  It comes sealed with a regular lid but included is the special pump to attach to the bottle, and the pump has a lid as well.I have very oily skin on my face and that also creates an acne problem for me.  So anything that can help me reduce that is great.  The first thing I noticed after receiving the item was that when you shake the bottle it is an extremely thick silvery/clear liquid.  And when you shake the bottle it takes a long time for it to move back down.  And when it does move back down you can see that it leaves a nice remaineder on the bottle - so imagine that on your face, when you apply it to your skin it won't make a mess and just run all over.  This serum also contains vitamins and collagen to give your skin that wonderful healthy glow.  And it works!  After a week of use I found my skin to be tighter, less lines and it definitely gave me that nice healthy glow.  You do want to make sure you use this after you wash your face, get those pores clear to get the best results.  Use it on your face and neck area but keep away from your eyes.  It has a very nice feel when you apply it to your skin, very silky smooth and it is NOT oily.  Which is great because I hate oily stuff and anything that leaves a residue.  Just rub it in and leave it on, apply it one time per day like I did and I noticed a difference after a week so I can imagine after using it for months what it would do for your skin :)  It is also good for sensitive skin because I have that problem and never had one problem with it :)***I received a complimentary product in exchange for an open and honest review.***", "This is a pretty cool product !  It works with my skin wherever I am. I love that its feeding my skin healthy stuff while I go about my living my life. I love the way it has smoothed my skin and made it look younger. I love that it helps protect my skin from damage.  My skin is smooth, soft and feels wonderful.Each skin product I try and review is used for 3 to 4 weeks. Having been an Avon Beauty consultant and an Aloette consultant in the past, I love great skin care. Be assured that if I say it works, it works !Linda", "I received this item in exchange for a review on my blog and on Amzaon.com.I like the pump on the bottle because it helps prevent bacterial contamination. The acid serum absorbed quickly into my skin, and I believe that it has helped reduce the appearance of fine lines on my face. I will need to use hylauronic acid longer for better results. I like that the acid is made from organic products and is safe for my sensitive skin.You can read my full review here: http://costaricanflora.blogspot.com/2014/07/how-to-take-care-of-your-skin-during.html", "I couldn't wait to try it out and applied some on my facial skin to see how it felt. It absorbed instantly and my skin felt smooth immediately! There was no bad after effects or stickiness to it at all which I really liked also.Since I've been using the Day by Day Hyaluronic Acid I've noticed that my skin feels firmer and even plumper. I really love the results from using this product! With continued use I hope to minimize the appearance of some of my fine lines.", "I have been using the Hyalurinic Acid Serum in the morning and at night after I take off my make-up. I wash my face thoroughly before I put it on. All you need is just a small amount to go on your face and neck. With the pump provided it comes out of the bottle easily and only takes about 2-3 pumps to cover your face.The serum is thick, and it takes a few minutes to absorb into your skin. Once it has absorbed, I notice that my skin feels tight, but not dried out. Even though my skin feels tighter, it also feels less dry and more moisturized.In the short time I have been using the Hyaluronic serum my pores are becoming smaller, which I love. My skin tone is more even, and the wrinkles around my eyes are getting smaller as well.  My skin looks and feel brighter and more youthful.I have not experience any breakouts or negative effects from using the Hyaluronic serum.I have only been using the serum for a few weeks and can only imagine how great my skin will look in a few more weeks.", "This serum is super smooth with no flaws that I could find and no scent. When I put the serum on my face it rapidly absorbed into the skin, this could be because of the lack of moisture. I did find that today the serum did not absorb rapidly, which is the first time. I have to contribute this to the humidity in the air. It is very humid here today. Hyaluronic acid will adjust its absorption rate, due to these factors such as humidity and environment. This is another reason why I really like hyaluronic acid products, such as Day By Day Hyaluronic Serum. Because of its properties it will take into consideration the environment around you. I know for me at least my skin is never the same day-to-day. It is always changing and I feel that this product is great because it will change with you.One major benefit to this particular serum is the ingredients. It is so nice to be able to read through the ingredients and be able to understand what you are putting on your face.For me this serum was a dream when it comes to my skin tone. Everything just seemed to even out. There were no more of those dark spots. They have toned down so much since beginning this routine. I have been using this product with an under eye serum that I just finished reviewing, and by far this is the product that stands out in my mind. I did notice other results, but I wanted to let you all know, what I really found different with this product. I did notice a drastic reduction in my pores as well, along with a smooth finish.I would recommend this to anyone that is trying to even out their skin tone, reduce pore size, hydrate skin and reduce fine lines. I can&#8217;t say much when it comes to the fine lines and wrinkles. I have been blessed thus far, not to have any that are bothersome, but with the results that I have seen with this product, I can really see how it would help with those bothersome lines.", "Have been using this serum for a month already. It was easy to add to my routine, just spirt a few pumps on my face every morning. It has rejuvenated my skin and i love how bright it makes my skin look i receive compliments daily now.", "It's a good formula. It's very nice that it has Vitamin C in it as well as Vit. E and the hyaluronic acid.It feels like most hyaluronic acid serums I've used- like it's aloe based, fairly thin and very easy to spread on, and very quick to absorb with very little if any residue.I always follow mine with moisturizer. It helps, especially as the Vitamin C can sometimes make skin a bit sensitive to the sun. This isn't a very strong concentration of C though - it has not made my skin red once, even though I am often outside in the garden during the high sun of the day.It's working fine. I've been using another hyaluronic acid serum and it's fairly comparable, though this one also has the Vit. C and E in it. My skin is looking great.I noticed that when it shipped, my bottle was very full. The eyedropper shipped separately and when I put it in the bottle, I had a completely full bottle with just enough space that it didn't spill and stayed neat. That's nice - so many products these days are giving way more packaging than product, and products look half empty when they come. This is a full ounce of product. Right now the price on this serum is very competitive with others I've tried. Most have been closer to $30. It seems like a very good deal.I was offered the product at a significant discount (but not free) for purposes of unbiased review. After using it for a while, I can say that it's a good hyaluronic acid serum and that I'd recommend it.", "Day by Day Beauty Hyaluronic Acid Serum Review I got the chance to review and I must say I really like it. I like the fact it has a little sprayer that come with it. I like the idea of this being Organic. The Day by Day Beauty Hyaluronic Acid Serum you only need a small amount to put on your face or neck. I really like the communication between the company and myself. They shipped out the item very fast and all this adds up to them being Excellent A++++++ all the way. Thank you so much.", "The serum is a little thick in consistency compared to other serums, but it glides easily on skin. It has a pleasant smell that doesn't stay on the skin, so you don't have to worry about the scent mixing with your other beauty products. The small amount that I used on my face was absorbed fast. Instantly, it felt soft and smooth. It also leaves a &#34;glowy&#34; look and I love that my skin looks plump and supple. My crow's feet appear lighter as well. I know my skin will continue to benefit from it with continued use. It works for me and I love the results!", "I love serum, but I really love Day By Day Hyaluronic Acid. It leaves your skin looking years younger and feeling refreshed. The formula is very lightweight and easy to apply. You have to love looking years younger without the high cost or surgery!", "I've been using this particular Hyaluronic serum exclusively for a couple of weeks now. I've tried several Hyaluronic acid serums for their anti-aging properties now that I'm getting older, and found that this one is also very good. I do find that they are all just a little different.This particular serum seemed to take a little longer to soak into my skin than some other brands. That did not bother me much at all. It comes out of the bottle easily and goes onto my skin very easily; it just takes a little time to completely soak in. You really don't need a whole lot to get whole face and neck coverage.This serum almost feels tight when it dries into my skin. I'm not sure why that is, but it doesn't detract from the overall effect of the serum. It doesn't make my skin feel super dry or like a mask dried on my skin, but it does have a slightly drying feeling. I've noticed my skin continuing to look better and, despite the drying feeling it has, it has taken away some of the dryness of my skin.I also noticed my skin seems brighter and more radiant and it also seems to help with my skin tone. I also noticed that my pores aren't near as large as they had been which is a huge bonus. I really love that this product helped with my pores. They've been such a sore spot with me.I've been using a thin layer of this product in the AM and in the PM before bed. I really do believe in the power of Hyaluronic acid serum for your face as I can actually see it working. It's a product I would suggest everyone have in their beauty supplies.This product would be great for any skin type or tone. It also has no scent.", "This was my first time using a Hyaluronic Acid Serum.  I have combination skin; oily and dry in some spots.  I also have mild fine lines starting to appear on my skin.  I know I need to start taking better care of my skin.  This product arrived is a glass bottle with a pump style applicator.  The serum is clear and dispenses very easily.  I apply it 2x a day.  It does take a couple min. to completely absorb in, but after it does you can apply makeup or go natural for all day soft beautiful skin with no residue.  After just 1 day of use I noticed my skin was so soft.  Over the past couple weeks I have noticed that my skin tone is more even, my dry skin is completely gone as well as the oily areas of my skin are gone too.  My skin feels and looks younger.  Amazing product, at a great price!"], "Gamma": [0.17697261273860931, 0.15567851066589355, 0.10696613043546677, 0.19734640419483185, 0.16219183802604675, 0.20084446668624878], "Beta": [[0.05413466691970825, 0.0565277561545372, 0.05493920296430588, 0.057462625205516815, 0.056646134704351425, 0.06288210302591324, 0.057293426245450974, 0.05808334797620773, 0.05821937322616577, 0.05181713402271271, 0.05849916860461235, 0.058398421853780746, 0.023463066667318344, 0.058826297521591187, 0.06263110041618347, 0.06098473444581032, 0.05400098115205765, 0.05519041791558266], [0.05375124141573906, 0.056085005402565, 0.054763566702604294, 0.05712929740548134, 0.056558091193437576, 0.06299959123134613, 0.05747490003705025, 0.057580847293138504, 0.05826987326145172, 0.0513220950961113, 0.058196645230054855, 0.0579754002392292, 0.024449249729514122, 0.05876779183745384, 0.06490226835012436, 0.061110518872737885, 0.05347367376089096, 0.05519000068306923], [0.05427214130759239, 0.055962175130844116, 0.0558013953268528, 0.05685453116893768, 0.056243062019348145, 0.060263119637966156, 0.05681987106800079, 0.057287175208330154, 0.05763670429587364, 0.05276506394147873, 0.05735054239630699, 0.057309962809085846, 0.031377315521240234, 0.05797924846410751, 0.06278091669082642, 0.05977041274309158, 0.05428309366106987, 0.055243249982595444], [0.05360336974263191, 0.056432828307151794, 0.055328428745269775, 0.05760583281517029, 0.05657563358545303, 0.06273013353347778, 0.057235829532146454, 0.058281105011701584, 0.05847873538732529, 0.05096624419093132, 0.058647312223911285, 0.058492206037044525, 0.01972336508333683, 0.05910653620958328, 0.0659727230668068, 0.06159987673163414, 0.054435621947050095, 0.05478427931666374], [0.05364267900586128, 0.05571858957409859, 0.05525246262550354, 0.0568353570997715, 0.056292902678251266, 0.06529975682497025, 0.057569678872823715, 0.057329799979925156, 0.05780927464365959, 0.051317356526851654, 0.058016665279865265, 0.058024317026138306, 0.02283811941742897, 0.05834323540329933, 0.066093310713768, 0.06078913062810898, 0.05373803898692131, 0.0550893098115921], [0.05357558652758598, 0.05644296854734421, 0.05525746941566467, 0.05761300399899483, 0.056587088853120804, 0.06289912015199661, 0.05728146806359291, 0.05829116702079773, 0.058511264622211456, 0.050874583423137665, 0.058690764009952545, 0.05852774530649185, 0.01939002051949501, 0.059137191623449326, 0.0661236047744751, 0.06165914237499237, 0.05434446409344673, 0.0547933429479599]]}
