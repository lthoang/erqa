I love the sensation of my skin before I use it . My skin feels hydrated.", "In my own defense, let me state that I&#8217;ve tried several hyaluronic acid serums and like all that I have tried.  I have not yet found one that I would not use, but do want to find the very best one for my individual skin.My first test for a new one is the serum itself &#8211; how my skin feels when and after I apply it and if it says what it claims to do.  Then I compare the method to dispense the serum to see how that compares.  For me, this serum was top-notch for how it felt on my skin and how my skin responded to it.  Especially today (after using it for about 10 days), I noted that my skin looked the best it has in ages after cleansing my face, applying the InstaNatural hyaluronic acid serum, a light moisturizer, and then my make-up.  Like all the serums I have tried, this does take a few minutes to soak in and be absorbed.  If one tries to put make-up on too quickly, it can feel sticky.  That is a common trait for all the ones I have tried and not a flaw for any of them.  Once my face has absorbed this serum, it feels soft and very smooth.  The bonus I appreciate for this particular one is that some of the fine lines around my eyes and mouth are greatly diminished.  My makeup goes on very smoothly also.At first, I did not like the eye dropper as the method to get the serum out of the bottle.  The eye dropper not only has serum inside of it, but when it is lifted from the bottles, it is coated on the outside with the serum.  Fortunately, the serum adheres to the outside and does not drip off, so all I do is slide my fingers over the outside to get some of the serum.  None is wasted and it has become quite easy for me to do. Since none is ever wasted, I have no complaint about the dropper now.  One brand I tried is very thin while this one is thicker but still very easy to apply.The company advertises a 100% money back guarantee if a customer is not satisfied.  Since I love the serum, I would not take that offer.  The product I received free for an honest review and I have to say, I honestly love it!  I would highly recommend this product to others.", "I've been using it as an all in one basically: toner, vitamin C, moisturizer... I put it on as soon as I wash my face and my friends have commented on how clear my skin looks. I never had much of a problem with acne so I know that isn't what they were referring to but I HAVE noticed that my skin looks brighter and smoother since I've been using only this product.", "I have reviewed 6 hyaluronic serums in the past year and this with every other instanatural product was by far the best.", "InstaNatural produces some of the best natural skin care around and this is one of those products! I have been a customer for close to a year and I keep coming back. Their Hyaluronic Acid Serum works well to brighten your skin as well as soother the redness and soften it. I would recommend this to anyone who uses products such as these. It's the best alternative to chemical skin care out there!", "I love that InstaNatural Hyluronic Acid Serum has added Vitamin C, Vitamin A, and Green Tea. Not only do I feel like I'm giving my face a little detox with the green tea, but I am able to skip an extra vitamin c serum when I use this. I love that it really does add moisture. I can use this serum in the morning and then follow with a bb cream. I don't need to use an additional moisturizer. At night I use this serum, but follow with a repairing night cream. It's very easy to apply. It's thicker like a lotion, but clear, and comes in a pump bottle. It applies smoothly, and feels silky against your skin. I am in love with this serum, it has to be one of the best I've ever tried!", "I have tried several Vitamin C products and they work well but I have to use other products to moisturize. This is excellent because it is an all-in-one for me especially on those busy nights. I have my C to soften the lines and lighten the brown spots and the Vitamin E to moisturize too. It absorbs in so fast and my skin feels great.  Very gentle and easy on my skin. It is great to have a reasonably priced skin care option that is gentle my skin. It goes on smoothly and dries in a flash too. It is easy to incorporate into my everyday skin care regimen and I like that it is a large bottle so I am good for a while.", "This serum is light and not sticky. It glides on and seems to leave my skin soft without feeling like it is coated in anything heavy.Swampy, sultry, sticky Florida makes for a drippy mess with some moisturizers. Then, God forbid you put makeup on over them or your face will run off like there is a fire in the wax museum. Plus, moisturizers just make me feel much hotter -- I am not sure if that's entirely true, but anywhere but nearly naked in the ocean makes me feel hotter down here in the dirty south.So I am torn -- do I go without and just allow the 100% humidity to be my only anti-aging treatment? People in humid areas do seem to age better. But I wanna give my skin its best chance. This serum seems to be the ticket. I can wear this under my powder mineral foundation for sunscreen and I don't feel too gooey. OK, that's a lie. When it is gooey down here, nothing works perfectly. But this seems to be as good as it gets.HA is so good for your skin. It is ubiquitous in our bodies and ads moisture to skin and joints, holding 2500x its weight in water. HA also decreases with age, as does everything except chin hair seemingly. Plus this includes vitamins C and E which are great for your skin. Considering the low price, the excellent ingredients plus the fact that I'm not melting like the wicked witch after a bucket of water -- at least not as quickly -- I am a fan.", "I love how amazing my skin feels from using all these amazing InstaNatural products. but when it comes to this serum where has it been my whole life, I have totally taken my natural skin care to a new amazing level, my skin feels & looks so healthy & that is what I want natural healthy skin.Use this serum & be prepared for the compliments. I love it!", "This worked great for my skin! It's super easy to use and didn't irritate my skin at all. I noticed a difference quickly!", "The green tea soothes the redness on my face and the vit C gives my face a nice glow. The two together in this product is genius! I really love this product. So far it my favorite for my face", "As a girl who honestly just loves the sun, I am constantly trying to hide my freckles and sun spots under layers of makeup. After trying Insta natural's Hyaluronic Acid I will never do that again! This stuff actually gets rid of the spots so there is no need to cake the makeup on overtop of spots! The spots are gone! My skin isn't dried out anymore & it is actually helping with my acne problem as well! The packaging was good too and I love the way the glass bottle looks and feels. I would recommend this to any woman, or even man who has struggled with dry skin, dark spots or even just dull skin. This stuff will make your skin look and feel 100x better than it did before & it's affordable which I also like!", "I really love this serum because even though it is a gel, it doesn't leave my skin feeling heavy or greasy or sticky.I absorbs into the skin so easily with no residue left behind. My skin feels so smooth and supple when I use this and it is way less oily as well. This serum has helped me with some of my hyper pigmentation as well. All in all I do and will recommend this product.", "I have been using this product for the last two weeks and I started seeing results after the first use, my skin was smooth, soft and felt moisturized. Living in Arizona with its dry climate I am always looking for a moisturizer that doesn't break my skin out and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. This product does that and so much more! I love how this product helps diminish the look of my fine lines and wrinkles as well as minimizing the appearance of my dark circles and the puffiness around my eyes. Also helps with my dry skin. I also love the fact that this product is not tested on animals. I am so pleased with this product that I have told all my friends about it!Disclosure: I received this product for free in return for my honest opinion.", "It is finally summertime and I am super happy about that. Time for bright colors and sandals! I love my growing collection of colored leather sandals. It is important to always wear eye protection (bring out those fashionable sunglasses ladies!) and use sunscreen protection even on cloudy days. I always wear a facial moisturizer with a SPF as well as my BB cream and mineral makeup which both have SPF. Healthy skin is beautiful skin, and at the age of 32, I want to protect my face and prevent early aging.One important way to do this is to follow common sense. Drink at LEAST 8-10 glasses of water a day, get plenty of rest, wear sunscreen and facial moisturizer, and eat plenty of fruits and veggies. I have cut out sulfates from my cleansing routine, and now oil cleanse my face. I first wash my face with the oil cleansing method at night, using various combinations of either jojoba, sweet almond oil, grape seed oil, rosehip seed oil or apricot kernal oil paired with caster oil, vegetable glycerin, and argan oil. Regardless of whatever oil I use, I always pair it with caster oil, glycerin, and Argan oil. After cleansing, I apply Vitamin C serum to my face before applying my bb cream and other makeup.I recently came across a company called Insta Natural and they are becoming one of my favorites. They have wonderful products that are created with top quality, natural ingredients. One big important aspect is that the products are made in USA. They are natural and do not contain harmful ingredients such as chemical fragrances, alcohol, parabens, sulfates, and they never test on animals.I was excited to be selected to try their hyaluronic acid. This serum is non greasy, non sticky, and has a light botanical fragrance. It is clear and the consistency is reminiscent to pure aloe vera gel. Hyaluronic acid is an excellent moisturizer that restores skins firmness, natural resilience and is beneficial for optimal skin health. This Hyaluronic Acid is organic and plant derived, and contains Vitamin C and E, Aloe, & Green Tea Anti-Oxidants. It also contains Glycerin, which is something I have added to my cosmetics for some time now. Glycerin attracts moisture onto your skin, and my skin loves it.Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant, it strips free radicals of their harmful toxicity. This helps to prevent damage to healthy cells. When skin has a lack of vitamin c there is a loss of elasticity and tightness in skin, and wrinkles begin to form due to the lack of collagen production. We have the most collagen in our youth, and aging skin naturally loses this important nutrient over time. Pollution, cigarette smoking (and secondhand smoke), and over exposure of harmful UV sun rays are also causes of skin damage. I am happy to see Vitamin C in this serum.This product contains witch hazel which is a natural astringent and can help with acne control by reducing inflammation. Tannins in witch hazel can help reduce swelling and heal broken skin. I have always been fond of witch hazel and have used it for years. Jojoba oil is similar to our skin's sebum which allows it to absorb easily and is not heavy. Jojoba is moisturizing and nourishing for your skin and another fantastic ingredient.I use this hyaluronic acid every day immediately following my vitamin c serum application. I try to use this twice a day, as it is soothing on my skin and I feel that it is working. I have dark circles under my eyes from poor sleep habits and hope to eventually heal them. I use 2-4 pumps of this all over my face, neck and decolletage, taking care to use a gentle touch when applying under and around my delicate eye area. I probably could get away with 1-2 pumps, but I am becoming a bit enamored with this serum. It is important to use your ring finger when applying products around your eyes and lids as that finger has a lighter strength than perhaps your pointer finger. You never want to tug or press hard around your eyes.I feel that this makes my skin smooth, supple and I like how it does not cause any irritation or break outs. I feel that it provides the moisture I need for healthy and beautiful skin. I recommend this if you are looking for a serum with top notch ingredients and skin loving benefits.This product arrived well padded and safely to me. The company has excellent customer service and stands behind their products with their guarantee. &#34;We back our products up with a 100-day hassle-free money back guarantee, no matter where you buy our product...If you are not completely satisfied, simply contact us and we will give you a full refund, no questions asked (you do not even have to return the bottle). Our #1 priority is to make sure our customers are completely happy.&#34; It is refreshing to see a company who cares about their customers enough to go above and beyond. What sets this particular hyaluronic acid apart from others I have tried, is that this is in a PUMP. (LOVE THAT) I am not extremely fond of a dropper. Dropper containers are sometimes messy (excessively drippy sometimes) and they have to be opened (which can cause some contamination from air). This pump functions well and is hygienic. This is in a dark cobalt blue glass container which is important for keeping the contents from being compromised due to excessive exposure to light.If you found this review or any of my other reviews interesting or helpful, please rate is as &#34;helpful&#34; and or leave a comment. I enjoy writing reviews and hearing feedback about what I have written as I feel reviews help those interested make an informed decision before purchasing. I also feel that honest and informative reviews improve a product by providing insight to the company. I believe reviews should be honest no matter whether an item was free, at a discount, or purchased. I am not connected to this company or any of the companies of products that I review. I am not paid for my opinions and do not receive any benefit for any purchases made based on my review.", "The consistency of the InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid is thicker than the serum I'm currently using and now that I think about it, it's similar to the consistency of a hand sanitizer. It is clear and colorless and actually smells nice. It has a bit of a flowery and fresh scent.The InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid Serum absorbs very quickly.  I saw instant relief to my dry, flaky skin. I am also glad that I didn't have any skin reactions or break-outs after using it. I also saw an improvement to my skin after several days of using it. It's a great moisturizer and effective.", "This product is amazing I sprayed a small amount on my arms and it dried quickly as I rubbed it in. I give this product a 5 star. I would recommend this to everyone.", "This is a really wonderful serum for anti aging and for keeping the face exfoliated . What I love about it is that even though its packed with powerful ingredients its did not make my skin look red or flaky as some other serums I have used before have done .This is a clear gel like serum that goes on the face easily and absorbs very quickly so you can than put on your makeup or your moisturizer. It has a Light Fresh scent and is a pleasure to use.What is really different about this serum is that most of the time when you use a serum with Hyaluronic acid in it the face can feel dry and tight I have used serums like this and its a very uncomfortable feeling. This serum glides on and drys quickly but does not give you that tight feeling . It also dose not pill when using product like makeup or moisturizers on top of it. I cant tell you how much I hate putting my makeup on top a serum and finding that it will roll off or pill off as I'm applying it. I was so happy to find out that this serum worked very well with my foundation and my sunscreen . Always be sure and use a sunscreen when using any kind of serum with  Hyaluronic acid.I was sent a free sample of this serum in order that make an informed review and my opinions are my own.", "The serum has a thick consistency, but it's very easy to slather on the skin. I love that it didn't make my face look glossy after application considering I have oily skin. It has a very pleasant smell, which I love. It smells fresh with a mix of mild floral and green tea. The serum is absorbed fast as you work it on your skin and my hand didn't feel sticky at all. You don't need to put on too much. A few drops can cover the entire face and neck area, so a little goes a long way.The only thing I didn't like about the serum is the scent goes away as it dries. I would prefer if the fresh scent also stayed on my skin.", "What I is nice about this serum is that it has a high percentage of hyaluronic acid in it. Hyaluronic acid holds 1000 times its own weight in water to carry moisture to the skin cells. It will invigorate the skin and keep it very hydrated. Vitamin C will lighten the skin, getting rid of hyperpigmentation and any dark patches on the skin. Vitamin E and Green Tea are anti-oxidants that fights off free radicals to help with fine lines and wrinkles. This serum is great for fry skin and skin that is in need of help with pigmentation issues.", "I love that this serum goes on quickly and does not just sit on my face making it look greasy or oily. I have had products that did that in the past and I had gotten to where I shied away from oil based products. But, now with this Hyaluronic Serum, I don't have to worry about that anymore.I am also very happy about the Vitamin E and Green Tea that is in this product because I firmly believe that they are some great sources of natural products that do wonders for your skin. I love that it does not have alcohol in the serum as that definitely dries the skin out and I have enough problems with my overly dry skin without adding more problems.Which brings me to the main reason I love this serum and that is that it keeps my skin feely hydrated and not parched and tight feeling from skin that is dehydrated. My skin loves this so much that as soon as I put it on, it quickly absorbs and my skin feels moisturized and I can see where some of the fine lines and wrinkles are starting to slowly fade away.So, for me, it's a win-win and I would recommend this product to friends and family!", "Hyaluronic Acid is something our bodies actually have naturally, to hold moisture, cushion, and aid in tissue repair. However when we get to age 18 and older the body loses some, causing our skin to wrinkle over time and become less hydrated.  Unfortunately the best way to get our skin back to what it once was, is to use a great and potent Hyaluronic Acid. Therefore, thanks to InstaNatural's  Hyaluronic Acid, we can get it for less than other brands even though they use the samehigh quality Hyaluronic Acid.What InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid provides:* Reduce Appearances of Dark Circles & Puffiness* Uses Highest Concentration of Hyaluronic Acid* Smooths skin texture, Diminishes The Appearance of Fine Lines & Wrinkles* Extremely Moisturizing and Plump Up The Skin* Cruelty Free, No Animal Testing* Vitamin E + C & Green TeaNow for me, I think the InstaNatural Hyaluronic Acid really benefited my skin after a few uses, I can see noticeable change in my complexion. With this clear liquid My skin became a bit brighter, the under eye puffiness actually went away, and my skin tone wasn't uneven anymore from skin and aging. The Hyaluronic Acid is like a treatment for transforming your skin to a youthful look, and making you feel even more beautiful.I love to keep this as my beauty secret. It's like the perfect treatment in a bottle! I can go out without makeup and just feel beautiful without worrying about under eye dark circles or dull skin. You will be impressed as well because it is a quick working product.", "I have tried a lot of products in an attempt to diminish the look of dark circles under my eyes, moisturize my skin, and reduce the look of fine lines around my eyes and forehead as well as to smooth out the texture of my skin. I can honestly say that, until now, none of the products I have tried and spent a fortune on have worked.This Hyaluronic Acid from InstaNatural has a very light and natural scent and has a very light gel texture. It glides easily on my skin and absorbs fully with no residues left behind. I noticed an immediate difference in my skin after using this product. My skin was much softer right away and it felt less tight from dryness. It gave my skin a very comforting feeling.I finished my face as I normally do with a tinted moisturizing lotion and makeup. It did not affect, in any way, my makeup. Other products that I have tried have, at times, left a greasy and heavy feeling on my skin. This product is as light as water on my skin; it&#8217;s like a drink for my skin!I did some research on Hyaluronic acid and found that it is a naturally occurring substance in our bodies. It helps cushion and lubricate joins and is a major component of skin tissue. So it would make sense to use this on our skin as it is natural and already part of our bodies.InstaNatural&#8217;s Hyaluronic Acid is joined with Vitamin C, Vitamin E and with Wild Crafter Green Tea. It is a very natural and wonderful product that is also affordable. The best part of all is that it really works and makes a difference.I, out of curiosity, actually applied a small dab to each of my elbows as they were sandpaper dry. I noticed an immediate difference. They were no longer scratchy! I applied this product early in the morning, and much later in the evening, they were still smooth! I never, ever, had a product be able to make a difference in the skin of my elbows. This is my proof that this product works exactly like it says it does. I am completely sold! While this product is really meant for your face and neck area, I will keep applying a small dab daily to my elbows.I highly recommend InstaNatural&#8217;s All Natural Hyaluronic Acid Serum as it genuinely works. They offer a full money back guarantee if you are not satisfied.  You will never have to take them up on their guarantee as this product is amazing!", "I love everything Instanatural puts out! It's a fantastic company with great products. This Hyaluronic Acid Serum is no exception! I was given a sample to try and I fell in love. It's more of a gel consistency than a true serum, and it applies very smooth and evenly over the face. It kept my skin very moisturized the entire day (I get day patches around my nose after awhile) but my skin stayed hydrated. It works great under my makeup, and I use this with my face primer to get all day coverage and wear. Great product!", "I really like this serum because it all in one serum. All the beauty goodness in one bottle. Its essentially Hyaluronic acid serum which works by hydrating your skin, second, Vitamin C which is a collagen booster, third : vitamin E which is an antioxidant that protects and repairs your skin & lastly green tea which is also an antioxidant & also helps reduce the acne.With all these great contents this serum works great on the skin. I am using it daily & can see the difference. Its working on my fine lines & wrinkles making my skin smoother, soft & suppleI'm a fashion & beauty blogger : [...]", "I think hyaluronic acid works best on someone who doesn't have real dry skin. It did make my skin feel soft and smooth but not for that long. I did see a decrease in my dark circles when using hyaluronic acid and that was plus.Overall, if you need to add some moisture to your skin during the day this would be great. Added more vitamin C and I definitely felt a real difference.Received complimentary, all opinions expressed are my own.", "I use this both on my face and stretch marks from when I had my kids. It works great! I love that it has all the nutrients my skin needs all in one serum so I'm not left needing another layer of stuff on my skin on top of it. It feels light and leaves my skin feeling soft. It dries pretty fast so I can put on my moisturizer and makeup soon after it's applied. I have seen my face evening out, with less worry lines on my forehead and love that it's in a 2oz bottle so it's going to last me a few months. It's a great product!", "new face primer for the new century, amazing and just when i thought i was done for here comes a product that literally saved me from sudden disaster, i lost my normal primer, honestly i couldn't find it anywhere so i decided to use this instead on my eye lids because mine are so oily. after i washed my face i added a few tiny drops of this before putting on my eye shadow and it never moved all day! What a life saver! Not oily or greasy like you would think it would be, and my skin just drinks it up like it was the only thing it has seen this good in a long long time!", "I give this a 5 Star Rating as I am very pleased with the product. It is doing wonders for my skin. My skin feels much better and I see my dark spots are lightening up. That is a ++. You can see the rest of my review at [...]", "I received the hyaluronic acid in exchange for honest review from Instanatural/Tomoson. I wanted to review the product because it contained vitamin C and E. I also loved the benefits of green tea. I used the product as a moisturizer for my face. The product has a light scent and is not heavy on the skin.", "Over the last several months, I have been trying out a wide variety of Vitamin C serums with hyaluronic acid. I have had moderate success with these products until I got a chance to try out Insta-Natural&#8217;s Hyaluronic with Vitamin C and Vitamin E.Unlike other products of this nature, this one came in a 2-oz. pump bottle. It has a semi-thick texture to it, and it applies evenly. I paid particular attention to applying it to my forehead, as that is where most of my wrinkles stand out.After several weeks of use now, I can state unequivocally that this product is hands down the best I&#8217;ve tried so far. You can literally feel the skin tighten after applying it. It is not sticky and absorbs nicely. The competition out there is harsh for this type of product and maybe I&#8217;ve jumped the gun early on my review.However, that is the way it is. Unless someone else comes along and produces a better product, this one will stay at the top of my list.", "I got this to try. I have used this for a few days now and love it.  Not sticky at all and soaks right into my skin.  I can use it under my makeup and can not even tell I am wearing it.  My skin is softer and smoother already.  I love that it also has the vitamin c in it.  Saves me from having to use 2 different products.  This one is truly an all in one."], "Gamma": [0.02935780957341194, 0.032871901988983154, 0.03328627720475197, 0.03243888542056084, 0.02650182694196701, 0.028834562748670578, 0.027415748685598373,
