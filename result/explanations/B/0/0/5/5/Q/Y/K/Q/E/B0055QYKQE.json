Just powered it up and running a 1100t BE.Pros: it's simple easy to install great looking board. All black and it is Gigabyte. Comes with los of USB 2.0, 3.0 and eSata ports. It is also Duel bios ready to. If you mess up your bios it will boot in the second bios chip and reload the first bios chip. Nice redundancy that Gigabyte put in. It comes with some cool software to over clock your CPU from your Windows OS.Cons: Was not very happy to just only receive a SLI bride, Triple SLI Bridge, and 4 ATA cables and that's it. I was very disappointed. I didn't even get any screws for this Bored. Lucky my previous XFX board had tons of stuff that it came with. I hate to write all of these cons on a new board that I have not even spent much time on. Also the PCIe 1.0 Slot is crammed in with the Northbridge chipset heat sink. So if you are planning on putting something in there you might want to consider that.FYI. UD3 UD5 and UD7 Gigabyte boards stand for how many SLI slots there are.", "I recently upgraded from an FX-6300 and a 7870 GHz so I wanted a new motherboard to properly run my new FX-8350 for the 8+2 power phase. I'm running with two R9 290's and I have not had a single issue with that setup. The board also supports another 290 if I ever decide to get one.Overclocking isn't an issue of course, and my 8350 has been pushed to 4.7 GHz with no problem. I could go higher, but I haven't had a need for it yet. The northbridge heatsink is really nice, and it never reaches above 45C even playing Watch_Dogs (which is horribly optimized not only for PC, but especially for AMD).I could go on, but there is only so much to say about a motherboard that you can't find out simply by looking in the manual online", "After two attempts to buy an Asus motherboard, both of which arrived DOA, I finally ordered one of these.  Since I am replacing an older Gigabyte board, I will be familiar with all of its quirks, installation procedures and BIOS (which is nearly identical to my previous board).This one fired up immediately, so I was able to FINALLY have a computer that works.  It doesn't have all of the bells and whistles of the Asus board I wanted, but I was finally able to boot the thing up to the BIOS and then to the operating system.  And, it came with the most recent BIOS (FB), so I didn't have to fool around updating that.I also like the expansion slots that allow up to three graphic cards to be linked together with SLI bridges (both two and three bridges are included with the board).The only thing this is somewhat annoying--and has nothing to do with the design of the board itself--is that the bottom fins of my CPU cooler would rub up against the first RAM stick if the cooler base wasn't offset by about an eighth of an inch to the left. But this is of no real concern since the majority of the heat created by the CPU is at the center of the of the body.  CPU temperature is the same as it would be with the base of the cooler located directly above the thing.  If you want to avoid this situation, get yourself a cooler that clears the top of the RAM or get RAM that has a lower profile than my GSKILL sticks.I've combined this board with an AMD 8320 CPU and the excellent Rosewill Thor computer case (read my review on this case on Amazon).I'm a happy camper now that I have the computer setup of my dreams.Oh, yeah.  Something has to be said about Amazon's great return policy.  I printed out pre-paid UPS address labels to send back both of those Asus boards--so that cost me nothing. In addition, they credited my account for the returned boards within two days.", "The GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD5 is extremely well designed and it's absolutely awesome to look at. Everything is spread out that you have enough room to work with. It supports big air coolers like Noctua D14 and doesn't block the ram sticks. Updating the bios for this motherboard is a piece of cake. You download the bios, reboot into bios and it will automatically load the file from your hard-drive/USB and you are done. Gigabyte has done a fantastic job of creating an amazing motherboard and providing a ton of features for overclocking your CPU.I'm blown away by the quality of this motherboard and Gigabyte has always made high quality products from graphic cards to motherboards. This motherboard is so well designed and the bios is easy to work with thanks to the UEFI technology. Overclocking with this motherboard is super easy and I was able to get my old CPU (960T) to 4.2Ghz with no trouble at all. Just change the multiplier in the bios and you are all set. The heatsinks over the VRMs are big enough that keep it nice and cool.I have always liked AMD for keeping the same socket and having reasonable prices with their processors. AMD said that they will keep AM3+ socket even after Steamroller is released which is great because we don't have to spend money on buying a new motherboard. Steamroller will bring a ton of improvements both to IPC and will lower the power consumption quiet a lot.This motherboard supports the newest FX Processors and will support Steamroller when it gets released. Vishera CPUs work great in this motherboard and overclock great too. You just need to update the bios that Gigabyte will release in the future. Gigabyte is very good when it comes to releasing bios/drivers/firmware for their products. Overclocking in this motherboard is a piece of cake and the 8+2 phase VRM power design helps a lot in overclocking.The GIGABYTE GA-990FXA-UD5 also supports 3-way CrossFire or SLI which is great if you are a multi-graphics user. It also comes with 6 native SATA3 ports and has support for RAID 0, 1, 5, 10. I recommend this motherboard to anyone who is looking to get the best AMD motherboard on the market. The Asus Sabertooth 990FX is also a very good motherboard and they are equally good. I had my old Phenom X4 960T at 4.2Ghz (1.46 volts) using this motherboard and it had no problem handling it. If you plan on upgrading to Steamroller when it's released, then this is motherboard will support it.Pros:-PCIe 3.0x-USB 3.0-UEFI Bios-A ton of SATA ports-Easy to Overclock-3-Way SLI/Crossfire-8+2 Phase VRM-Sexy color schemeCons:-None, really.The Gigabyte GA-990FXA-UD5 is one of the best motherboards for AMD that Gigabyte has made. It comes with a ton of SATA ports and comes with 8+2 Phase VRM that can handle a ton of volts like a champ. Overclocking with this motherboard is great and I have seen a lot of people push the Thuban CPUs up to 4.2Ghz using this motherboard. It has an amazing design and can support up to 3 way SLI/Crossfire. If you run multi-GPUs then this motherboard is great for that. The bios is also super easy to work on and update because of the UEFI technology. I highly recommend this motherboard to all AMD users who want a high end motherboard.My main rig:Case: Corsair 650DGPU: EVGA GTX 780CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)PSU: Corsair AX850Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAMSSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GBMB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87OS: Windows 7 64bit", "I have 4 custom built PCs and 6 PCs total.With that said.I have two AMD Systems, and while I elect to use ASUS for Intel, I have found Gigabyte is my brand for AMD.  I bought this Motherboard with the intention of having an easy time getting a sixcore 3.3ghz FX Chip up and running, and I did.  The board has loads of features, great slot selection, it has 3 PCIe slots (x16) and works with a Nvidia GeForce GTS 460 I am using (and also another card in another slot, an ATI FirePro 4800) and has a PCIE USB3 (extra 2 port) card in it, running great.  Used an 850w Power Supply, which seemed ample and the motherboard has a good standard bios (its not UEFI for you UEFI fans out there) but it is a standard old Award Bios.One thing I noticed is with win7 ultimate there is no sleep mode setting for the PC obvious but you can still set one if you want to (I do not but I notice these things and report them).  If this MB is as reliable as my 880FX Gigabyte or numerous other Gigabyte boards in the past have been (I Been using Gigabyte since before they had  US website, in other words when gigabyte.com.tw was the only one out there - yeah about 15 years) and they always come true for me with AMD.I have only built two intel based machines in the last 15 years (AMD is usually my preference but I went with two lga 2011 3960Xtreme's as AMD cannot compete with it) as I had the cash.  Interesting facts is this scores well on benchmarks (the FX chip) against my 3960X's at 1/4 the price.This motherboard looks like yet another winner by Gigabyte (I have never had a Gigabyte board fail, or be DOA on me. I can't say that for ASUS) in general the computers get older than they are worth to still use before a problem with their boards pops up.I recommend this board to anyone who wants good slot diversity for expansion, good compatibility with diverse video, and wants to run an FX Chip on an AM3+.Very satisfied with the purchase, and Gigabyte as a motherboard make overall.", "purchased board to use with fx 8xxx cpu board is ok but cpu is not board works well with another cpu installed easy", "I have had this mobo in service for 23 months, running 8-10 hours a day. The simple version is, it has not given me a single bluescreen, has been quick to recognize and not fussy about all hardware I have installed. I have installed nearly 20 motherboards in systems for myself or for friends and relatives, and this one is at or near the top in terms of initial quality and apparent long-term quality and capability. The Ultra Durable (UD) line from Gigabyte is superb -- I have replaced them only to upgrade to greater capabilities, and never due to failures. That alone speaks volumes to me and will keep me a Gigabyte user for the foreseeable future.Pros* The board's layout puts the 8 SATA ports (eight, wow) in close proximity to most cases' drive cages* Employs a recent, high-quality BIOS (with a backup BIOS as well, an excellent feature)* Extra-thick heavy-duty PC board increases rigidity and resistance to cracking (all cases flex, especially when being picked up and moved, so the board has to resist this torsion; cheap boards can develop cracks in the solder traces this way, and become inoperable)* Handles 32GB of DDR3 (have used this since day 1 of this install)* Handles the very latest AMD CPUs (currently up to 8 cores, which I am using), with more added frequently* Fast throughput: no bottlenecks or random slow-downs* Both the northbridge and southbridge run cooler than past years' models, due to larger and more effective heat sinks (and no micro muffin fan to die after a few weeks)* Several rear-panel USB ports offer a 3x higher current rating for offline charging than usual* No waste and driver inconvenience with low-quality onboard video* Onboard LAN works perfectly; it was recognized immediately by the OS and has not given me any troubles. Throughput is optimal.* Four internal USB headers (3 of 2.0 and 1 of 3.0) for front-panel devices (note that these are not USB A but rather the standard 10-pin and 20-pin internal headers)Cons* CPU location is slightly misaligned from optimum position for best ventilation* All of the USB ports should be USB3.0, rather than a mix of 2.0 and 3.0* Onboard audio is adequate but easily improved on with a $40 add-on cardOther thoughtsI am highly impressed with how easily this mobo sets up, starts and then keeps going with no complaints. It has been rock-solid, literally zero BSODs that i didn't cause myself. Drivers were easy to install off the supplied CD (and one update off the Gigabyte website). I updated the BIOS using the Gigabyte tool, and that too went smoothly. The UD series is simply excellent, and I'll keep on upgrading within this product family because it's so solid and reliable.UpdateNearly two years on, this board is still going great. I've had no errors or unexplained shutdowns I can attribute to it. I have ditched Win7 in favor of Ubuntu 12.04, and now Ubuntu 14.04 and for all installs, the board performed flawlessly and had its components recognized properly. Definitely near if not at the top of my mobo list for long-term stabilty and value.", "Great updated motherboard for an AMD 1100T.  This motherboard may have an older chip running it [older BIOS format], but now my SSD and 6 HDDs are now running in unison...not as fast as my i7, but faster than my i5 with no OC'ing yet.  This board has everything I needed and my Antec 920 water block has room to breath...which is a good thing.  No complaints or wishes for anything more...this board is great in my newly built HTPC.", "If you truly want a top notch custom PC, you need to start from the ground up with high quality parts. If you buy this motherboard, you're on your way to a super fast computer.This motherboard has a few really solid aspects, like:Bunch of USB ports - 6 USB 2.0 with 3X the power on the back, then 2 USB 3.0 on the back. There are even slots for USB 3.0 on the front of your computer!Ram, Ram, and more Ram - This Motherboard accepts upto 32GB of 2,000MHz RamGraphics Cards galore - This motherboard is made for Graphics Cards, so don't expect any integrated graphics over here. You can technically hook up three cards to this board, but I only suggest two since the last slot is on X8 and will slow down the rest of your cards.Am3+ - Get ready for the future with AMD FX series processors!However, this motherboard does have a flaw or two:The last Graphics Card slot is only X8, which slows down the second graphics card and kind of making that slot useless.This motherboard also requires A TON of power just to turn it over. I tried using my Thermaltake TR2-500Watt just to start out with, and it wouldn't do anything to this motherboard. Get atleast 600Watts with this motherboard, and with some intense graphics cards, I'd get closer to 1,000 Watts if I were you.Overall, I'm so happy that I bought this motherboard. You really need to have a good foundation to have an awesome PC, and this board gives you that :)", "I was using a GA-A75-D3H before this and I though that one was pretty good. I think this one is AMAZING. Great cooling, great color scheme, great chipset (it has a Marvell chipset on it, too, connected to the gray SATA jacks)... I also enjoyed how it boosted the perfoemance of my peripheral hardware. In the Windows Experience Index, my RAM went from a 7.6 to a 7.9, the video card went from a 7.5 to a 7.9 (don't know why they went down in the first place, because I used to get a 7.9 when I first installed them), and my SSD's are even more snappy (they were already a 7.9). The only problem I have with this (and pretty much ANY motherboard I've ever workd on) is that the SATA jacks are inaccessable once the video cards are installed. this is easy enough to circumvent by just installing all the SATA devices THEN the video cards, but if I want to put something else in there later, I'll have a lot of extra work to do."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.006545413751155138, 0.00019662562408484519, 0.2952915132045746, 0.37291499972343445, 0.007827330380678177, 0.29203903675079346, 0.0006318546365946531, 0.0012161245103925467, 0.0026309506502002478, 0.020706117153167725]]}
