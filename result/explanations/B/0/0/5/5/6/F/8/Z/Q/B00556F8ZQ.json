I don't mind - I only watch movies on it.Starts quickly, turns off quickly (unlike non-LED projectors). Has a wide beam (projects a large screen even when rather close to the wall.300 lumens is enough! I compared to 3000 lumen office projectors and was afraid this wouldn't be bright enough; this is BRIGHT! When the sun goes down and we close the blinds - it's as bright as a TV, so don't worry.", "\"UPDATE: January 29, 2012; I have posted a youtube video showing the focus at startup. As you'll see, it isn't that bad. It is slightly fuzzy but still readable and the videos don't seem to be affected (although I'm sure they are, if you look hard enough). With the price of this projector, the longevity of the lamp, and the quality of the picture, a 10 minute period at the start shouldn't be a huge problem for anyone. But to each his own. I still stand by my five star rating. I will update again if I come across something else. Good Luck!!!!UPDATE: March 26, 2012; I continue to add videos to youtube. (optoma ml500 user review) I am 100% sure the focus at startup is because of the room temperature. Now that I am in warmer weather, the focus is clearing up in about 2 minutes. Once in the winter, I had the wood stove pretty hot, which made the livingroom warmer than normal and the projector started up completely in focus. So once spring and summer temps are up, there won't be a focusing period. One other small issue I have noticed is that the projector seems to need a system reset every 120 hours or so. I have over 800 hours now and it still works and looks great. However, every 120 hours or so it will shut down. I have to unplug it for about a minute. Then I plug it back in and it goes back to normal. Everything is still great quality. For picture quality and performance I still stand behind my 5 star rating. But because of needing a type of reset I would bring it down to 4 1/2 stars. This could just be my projector. I will update again. If you have questions, be sure to ask. It is amazing as I am writing this review on my 100\"\" screen, sitting comfortably on my couch. :)Update: May 6, 2012  Everything is still great. I have over 1200 hours now. Still shuts off every 120 hours (approximate). Quality is still great. Crisp picture from corner to corner. I have noticed that with Blu-ray the image is the best this projector will put out. So, if you have a Blu-ray setup, your movie nights will be outstanding with this projector. HDMI is the best input to use, VGA is very good as well. You will notice with the RCA video cable that the image looks very much like standard definition (which it is). But it still looks great. Let me know if you have questions or would like to see a certain video.Update: November 17, 2012  I am at around 3000 hours now. I am still very happy with this projector. I can confirm, without a doubt, that the focus issue is related to the environmental temperature. Now that its winter again, if I don't keep the room temp up, there is a warm up, focusing period. The projector still requires a restart about every 120 hours. Very odd, but it works. Playing Black Ops is just amazing, movies are crazy good, and regular tv viewing is extremely inviting. I have had a couple of my family and friends buy a similar setup to mine cuz they are as impressedd as I am. It is very cheap when you compare to other projectors with the same specs. I now have about 9 videos on YouTube in response to requests. So, if you have a question or something you want to see, just let me know.--------------------------------------------------I can't say enough about this projector. The picture quality is awesome! The colors are outstanding, the clarity is stunning and it is very bright. Whoever is saying it isn't bright enough during the day is either watching it outside in direct sunlight, or with no roof on their house. I keep mine on eco mode because this projector is bright enough to do it. We watch at all hours of the day, keep our two windows open AND have lights on and can still see the picture very clearly. One downfall of having more light in the room is the black levels are sacrificed. If you can't watch a tv with bad black levels during lighted conditions then this should only be for your theater room. But this is more than adequate at allowing you to watch tv in the daytime. You'll be able to read everything on the screen and see all the detail.I've seen some complaints about fan noise, and this is NOT a problem. Who watches tv with the volume all the way down anyway. Even with the projector volume on low I can't tell its running.I spent way too many hours researching this. But I am not one to waste my money so I wanted to make sure I would be pleased. And I couldn't be happier. If you are close to deciding on this, just do it. You will be impressed. The speaker does a good job, the fan noise is not an issue, the picture quality is amazing, it is very portable (although i'll probably leave mine mounted), and the rated hours of the led's are impressive.For the money, this is the best projector you will buy. I am coming from a 57\"\" sony HD tv and I won't ever get another tv after this purchase. I will however buy a 1080p LED projector when it gets into my price range.Let me sum it up for you; PS3 games are out of this world, movies are like being at a theater, surfing the internet is crazy awesome on a 100\"\" screen.Pros:-picture quality-good speaker-very nice at 100\"\"-very bright-awesome colors-fan noise is not an issue-way too many positives to mentionCons:-there is an initial focusing period of about 5 to 10 minutes, not so bad you can't watch tv. Not bad at all. But if you want to surf the net, you'll want to wait for it to completely focus first. This isn't an issue for me because I have mine on most of the time. Who flips the tv on 30 seconds before they want to watch the most important thing they will ever see? AND you'll still be able to see it AND read it.I have posted four youtube videos and will post more if you have a question or want to see something. Just ask!You won't be disappointed!\"", "I have the product now for a few hours and here's what I have to say about it:The reason why text will never look sharp, is because the LED display behind the projector is diagonally organized, not hor/vertical. Meaning, instead of showing a pixel line like this:RGB|RGBRGB|RGBRGB|RGBThey show it like this:|RGB|RGB|GB|RGB|RG|RGB|RGB|Causing lines that are 45 degrees on the screen to be sharp instead.This also makes this projector good solely for computer games, and movies, nothing else (meaning, forget web browsing or using it as an extension of your pc! It'll work, but the letters on the screen are fuzzy like when an LCD is not calibrated correctly).The projector uses M3 screws for the ceiling mount, unlike most that use M5 or M6.Also, the projector projects the image upwards, instead of straight forward.In other words, old projectors you needed to focus on the wall, and on that focal point there will be as much screen space above, below, as to the sides of it.This projector you can put flat on the ground, and it will project the bottom of the screen equal to the ground, in other words, the screen will be displayed above the focal point.This causes problems with existing projector mounts, as when you want to mount it to the ceiling, you need to mount it as high up as possible, if you want your screen to be somewhat squarish (and not lose too many pixels due to keystone correcting the trapezoid shape).Mounting it on a regular ceiling mount, and your image will be projected too low, causing you to tilt the projector, and lose precious pixels, due to keystone (because the image will be displayed as a trapezoid, instead of a square).This brings additional problems! The perfect mount would be to mount your projector parallel with the ceiling, preferably ON the ceiling. However, like in most rooms, there's somewhere a lamp or lightbulb between the projector and the projected area. I had to re-design my room ceiling light to be hanging upto 3 inch from the ceiling, in order to not to be in the way of the projection.If it had been even 1/2 inch lower, the bedroom light would have been in the projection area, and would show a shadow on the wall!I placed the projector about 10ft from a matte (=non-glossy), white wall, with even surface. With that, I get about a 100in screen.According to the calculator I should get 3in more, which I lose because of keystone adjustment of -3, because I was unable to mount the projector any closer than 6in from the ceiling.The screen displays from the roof, 53 in down, leaving me 5 in of space for items on the dresser in front of the wall.The room is about 10 by 16 ft in size, with the surrounding walls in a light green (save for the roof in white, and the projector wall in white.In normal mode, the projector displays well in a room where there's some outside light.In the above situation, I found the projector to be over-saturated both in color and the light intensity; even on eco mode, to watch movies in a pitch dark environment.Eco mode works fine when there's ambient light available.The colors are over-saturated, which is good, as it makes bad recorded movies look better. The bad is that normal to good saturated movies, look way too saturated.Even with Gamma, over-saturation, and expanded colors set to minimum, you still get an over-saturated image, but at least it'll be viewable.This makes it very pleasing to the eye, however the image displayed is not correct.It's like an enhanced playback of a low bitrate MP3 file. It may sound good in some cases, but in other cases it just gets in the way, and gets annoying.Compared to theFAVI RioHD-LED-2 Mini Projector, this one is way more bright. The spectrum from black to white (meaning dark to light) is also way wider, to the point where dark settings are too dark to comfortably see anything (just see a black mud), and the brights are too bright, lighting up the room with every explosion, spark, or light frame in the movie, and hurting the eyes, causing eye strain!In this case the 'contrast' setting works opposite!If the bright flashes makes your eyes hurt, giving you epileptic seizures or something, you actually have to INCREASE the contrast, opposite of what logic would tell you, to have a more evened out picture.The 500 lumen is a good amount for watching movies in the dark, or showing powerpoint or something presentations during the daylight.For movies, perhaps 400 lumen would be the sweet spot for a 100in screen (10ft away from the projector).The menu structure of the player is illogical, and difficult to follow.Sometimes, by changing a setting, other settings you previously set, get re-set, requiring you to re-set them.The menu also changes depending on which channel you are in. In some channels (say HDMI, or Video), certain options are not available.It is a very advanced menu structure, 2, sometimes 3 levels deep, and finding the option you're looking for takes some time!The main menu's are not named neither! They're only recognized by position of the icon. The icons are unclear in what they stand for; I would have preferred a name, over icons I can not identify in the main menu.I also followed the advise of another user, and bought a self programmable remote control, to replace the crappy control that's been brought with the projector. The good thing is that you can use the RC almost anywhere in the room (you don't have to be right in front of the RC receiver, like with theFAVI RioHD-LED-2 Mini Projector).It also does not interfere with other (chinese) electronic products, like media players, RC light bulbs, or DVD players or the kind, so it's a good remote signal encoding they use for the RC, but the handheld device, mechanically is too weak to last more than a year.I've been working hours to try to get the device calibrated!There are some settings, not as many as I had hoped, but they're so difficult to set the projector right!Most of these settings are linear, for instance, I want to make the dark areas brighter, the white areas will get whiter too; and reverse.They have no curve adjustments, to get a better contrast adjustment (see dark areas lighter, see bright areas less bright), and even bright recordings (like explosions) hurt the eyes in a dark room. I figured out, that it works the opposite, setting contrast higher instead of decreasing it, will actually diminish painful eyes due to flashes or explosions on screen in a dark room.The projector causes an enormous buzz on the audio gear, so much that when connecting the video to a laptop, balanced studio monitors connected to that pc will buzz like crazy!As soon as the VGA port gets unplugged, the desktop speakers become silent.I had to get my lower quality unbalanced desktop speakers to get the audio to work with minimal buzz!Connecting pc via VGA also causes a scrolling line over the screen!I had expected something better of this projector!Lucky we'll mainly be using DVD and BlueRay devices, however, I have plenty of PC recordings that I would want to play back, if not from the annoying scrolling bar!HDMI works fine, however I'm stuck on the HDMI sound.Like many users have mentioned, the internal speaker leaves much to be desired for.In order to extrapolate HDMI audio, I'd have to get into quite some kinks, one thing where I am the movie industry so ungrateful for! I'd have to buy and HDMI splitter, one in two out, and a HDMI convertor (HDMI to VGA and stereo audio).Then connect both devices, and send one HDMI signal to the projector, and the other to the extractor, to get the audio working on decent speakers!TheFAVI RioHD-LED-2 Mini Projectorhas a line out, which can be used to send back audio signals to the monitors, and theFAVI RioHD-LED-2 Mini Projectoralso does not cause scrolling lines, neither does it make my studio monitors buzz!So, I'm divided... In some way, I've improved my video (somewhat, except for the too high contrast ratio's), but decreased my audio experience with this projectorThe internal media player takes a long time to recognize USB drives, or SD cards. Once it does, it plays back certain DivX/MP4 movies, but can't play back older recorded movies (maybe D3vX or something).The media player also does not have subtitles working; but it plays back the movies it recognizes quite well.I do have the impression, that when playing back a movie from USB/SD that the fan is louder than when playing it back from an input signal like HDMI, or video, or VGA.May be my impression only....So far, I'm a little underwhelmed by the performance of this projector!I had expected better!", "Instead of purchasing a large LCD, I opted for the portability and convenience of a projector. Like the other new LED projectors on the market, there are significant limitations to this unit, such as the lack of brightness and no optical zoom or lens-shift. Nonetheless, if you have a compatible viewing space (right throw distance, ambient lightning, etc.), and can accept the quirks of projectors, this unit makes a suitable replacement for a conventional display.", "\"Update:  Have had this for more than a year - no issues!DAYTIME:  Sorry, but not bright enough to see on a white wall during the day!!  My living room has two large skylights, a slider window, a bay window (3 windows) plus two other windows.  Not really fair for a 500 Lumen LED projector to try and overcome.  In order to actually see the projected images during the day I have to close blinds on all six windows and had to put up some blocking panels for my skylights.DUSK - NIGHTTIME:  Picture is excellent.  720p Top Gear episodes (mkV format) from SD card look crystal clear.  480i/480p images from local broadcast or DVD are excellent.  I would not even bother with a real TV after using this projector.INPUTS - I've tested HDMI, SD, Composite Video and VGA connections, and all worked perfectly.  The first few times I tried VGA it didn't work but I blame that on my PC because I got it after a restart.SOUND - I've only tried the on-board speaker with my TopGear Episodes (mkV format) played from the SD card.  It is just loud enough on max volume to hear while watching the video in a very large carpeted room with projector hung from the ceiling.  Sure would be ideal if there was some way to get audio back out of the Optoma so I could pump it thru my home theater receiver.The Optoma is very small, lightweight, durable and easy to setup.  I have no worries hanging it from my celing - even got rid of a ceiling fan to mount the projector.  To initially test my setup I put the Optoma on a stepladder and plugged it in.  I was instantly projecting Wii Games or the local news using only my Government Convertor Box (Dish DTV Pal Plus) plugged into composite video.When I went to permanently install the Optoma, that was just as easy too.  I took a camera tripod and dismantled it using only the 3 way adjustable mount, the mounting tab and center tube (basically took the 3 tripod legs off).  I then welded a plate to a slightly larger diameter tube to accept the center tube of the tripod.  The welded plate was screwed to my ceiling and the projector was mounted upside down.  Automatically the Optoma knows it is upside down and after initial startup the projector inverts the picture (you can also manually set the setting in the menus).Originally I was going to go out and get a 55\"\" or 60\"\" LED LCD TV.  But I always admired DLP technology and love anything LED.  The Optoma ML500 was one of three choices for me when looking to upgrade my Home TV/Gaming and Movie experience.  I also looked at the ViewSonic PLED-W500 and the Acer K330.I was definitely NOT going to buy a projector with 2,000/4,000 hour bulb life, I don't care how many lumens it had.I liked the warranty and features of the ViewSonic, but the Optoma projects to 180\"\" screen size (I knew I needed something like 110\"\" max, but wasn't sure exactly how I would use the projector in the future).  The ViewSonic is limited to 30\"\" - 100\"\" / 0.76m - 2.54m screen size.  It turns out that I was right because I was able to project to 110\"\" and max out the wall space I have.I was also extremely impressed with the packaging of the Optoma... it came in a cardboard box and then inside it was a stout, hinged bubble pack over the extremely nice Optoma carry case.  People traveling on business will love this case---I wish I had a good use for it.  After that, there was also plastic wrap over the Optoma.  Comes with power cord and VGA cable.The two overwhelming benefits of the Optoma are the extra large screen size (who cares about an 80\"\" LED LCD TV when you can go up to 180\"\") and the very low power consumption.  1.2A is still less power than a 46\"\" Sharp LED LCD TV(LC46LE830U)... and you get up to a 180\"\" screen with the projector!Overall, I am extremely happy with my Optoma ML500 LED DLP Projector.  I would recommend it to anyone who has the provisions in their home to use a projector instead of a TV, or who needs a small projector for work (and I didn't even discuss all the great built in features like native Microsoft and PDF file viewing, etc).\"", "\"I am used to spending in the $300-$350 (refurbished or not) range for lower-end not-completely-home-theater-grade projectors (such as my past two Infocus projectors, the X1 and the IN24+), but my firm decision to stop doing the \"\"projector shuffle\"\" (buying projectors in that price range and realizing that once the bulb goes, it's only $50-60 more for a whole new projector!) and get on the LED bandwagon led me to theFAVI Entertainment RioHD-LED-4 XGA (1024 x 768) Portable Projector- which is just not QUITE good enough for home theater. For one, it has a \"\"0% Offset\"\" - meaning that tthe projector must be DEAD center of the screen to get it to not use keystone correction...and the keystone correction takes the nice XGA resolution down to something that looks like SVGA (800x600) or worse. In other words, avoiding using fuzzy keystone correction is the exception, not the rule.So...with a heavy heart, I decided to stop being quite so cheap and sprung the extra two hundred eighty bucks for this unit. It is somewhat bigger and significantly heavier (thought still lighter than my old Infocus X1 or IN24+ projectors), and let me tell you - with good source material, it's stunning!Obviously nowhere else are you going to get this large a screen in this high a quality for this price. I am even thinking (based on recent trips to Target, Walmart, etc.) that you can't even get a smallish television at 720p that looks this good (WITH excellent source material, mind you...garbage in garbage out as ever, and that rule applies here).Material that is heavily encoded/compressed to begin with is going to look flatter and less alive.But proper 1080i/p or 720p material that has been encoded with care and high quality can look just stunning (for a cheaper projector).As others have noted, the reds are quite eye popping.I watched a bunch of 720p and 1989p torrent BR rips with mixed results. Some look good but not amazing, and a few (like the well-encoded copy of World War II In HD that I got, bluray rip) are at times eye-popping. Again - garbage in, garbage out, so make sure you feed this thing the best, because I have been stunned by this thing thus far on SOME material. It is capable of greatness, you just have to feed it great media.Anyhow, still disappointed in the fan noise, people say in eco mode it's \"\"barely noticeable\"\" (yes, maybe with the volume cranking), but I really wanted to be able to use it while listening to hi-res 24 bit / 96khz music files and let the silent sections be silent...unfortunately, not ideal, but oh well. Maybe a fan mod will come.In any event, I am very happy with this unit and would STRONGLY urge anyone looking at the current lineup of Favi RioHD projectors to aim just a little higher. For example, we put in The Dark Crystal, and the opening scene on this projector was far richer, more vivid and detailed than on the Favi RioHD-LED-4 - unfortunately. Putting that projector in \"\"KTV\"\" mode (whatever that means) made it brighter, but it still lacked depth and magic...this one lacks depth and magic of a $1900+ Home Theater projector, but to a lesser extent. I think this is the current sweet spot (or some of this projector's clones), so really consider just spending the extra two bills and enjoying your picture, instead of agonizing over it (or it's placement).In this comparison, it's a case of the old adage \"\"when you buy quality, you only cry once.\"\"\"", "\"After reading many reviews I decided to purchase this projector for a low cost home theater solution. I am currently using it in a blacked out room to throw a 150\"\" 16:9 screen. One word... gorgeousPros:Brighter than expectedColor saturation is amazingPrice is reasonable (even though it is $100 more expensive now than when I bought it)Connectivity is good (don't bother with SD cards though)Weight is amazingly lightBulb Life is insanely long (YAY LEDS)Startup Time is shortShutdown Time is shortCons:All black with 120hz signal causes the device to overheat, gointo emergency fan mode, and shutdownCan be tricky to get the right output settings on a pc to do HDMI (many out of range issues)Posterization can happen in fast moving subtle gradients (such as shadow on skin)Focus control at such a large size is difficult generally one area or another will be less focused than others (sides vs center) but it is only noticeable on text.Focus needs a warm up period.

Great price / performance!\"", "I use this for giving training and to DJ company events.  So the big things for me are easy setup, portability and sturdiness.  This projector easily meets those conditions.  The bonus features are the HDMI input, WXGA wide-screen format support and ability to display content off a SD card.
