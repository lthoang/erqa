I recently found a great deal for the the doomsday playstation move w/sharp shooter and finally purchased it and this must have-game. I have to say this feels like a great arcade port. First, the aiming control is great with the motion controller and my playstation sharp shooter/mad catz 3d shot handgun. I actually prefer to use the mad catz handgun because it is smaller, lighter and more comfortable for rail shooters like this game. Second, the grindhouse style is done with perfection with the grainy footage, crazy storyline (better than Uwe Boll's movie), excessive violence, silly comedy and the sexual nature. If you like those sort of movies, you will like how this game used that style. Third, you are SHOOTING ZOMBIES! I like realistic military shooters and sci-fi shooters but I prefer survival zombie horror genre more. My only gripe after a couple days of playing is that there is too much unnecessary cursing. They should have had just a few curses and also had an option in the menu to \"\"bleep\"\" out the bad language. I would give this game a 4.4 stars out of 5 and would highly recommend it for shooter fans.\"", "\"Shoot some zombies...er. mutants! Use the Playstation Move controller to aim and waste hordes of baddies in this hilarious shooter on rails. Originally, this game was released for teh Wii, but I enjoyed it so much I had to purchase it for the PS3. I thought the Wii version was awesome, and this version is even better. The PS3 version looks better, as the visuals are sharper and more vibrant, so it's easier to see what you are shooting at. In short, this is basically the same game you would get for the Wii, except it looks better, and there is more of it, and more House of the Dead: Overkill is a good thing. The back of the packaging says \"\"more blood, more gore, and more strippers,\"\" and it delivers on it's promise. This is one of the best shooter on rails you'll play because it's not only a good game, but it's also hilarious, and at times creepy and weird. It pays homage to the old-school b-movie zombie horror films of the past. This game also has a ton of replay value.\"", "Great game to simply put it. For only 40$ its a great party game for when you have friends over. Highly recommend the PS move controller though or even the PS mouse (frag) to a lesser extent. The regular PS anaglog sticks are difficult to aim with.Graphics are upgraded HD/3D as per this being an upgraded Wii port from last year. Entire gameplay is an on rails light gun shooter, with varying options to increase difficulty or flat out add more zombies per round with a final Boss at the end of the level. Nine Levels in total, this is up 2 from the Wii version, one of which added was a Stripper Bar scene which is lots of fun. decent voice acting for each character.Positives:- Low purchase price- Great party game for friends drinking late night- Finnaly a reason to own PS move- Zombies- Great 70's style Music- Tons of hidden UnlockablesNegatives- You need a PS move controller, the reg analog controllers dont cut it.- No online multiplayer", "Yes Killzone3 is great but not everyone can grasp its move and navigation controller set up, right away,  now house of the dead is point and shoot anyone can jump in and have fun... if you can stomach the grindhouse style of story and the cheese makes your eyes roll, but is PlayStation move fun . Right up there with The Fight Lights Out and Sports Champions as the  best move games.", "\"\"\"Are you going to tell me what the (bleeping) G stands for?\"\" - Detective Washington\"\"Nope.\"\" - Agent GIt's been said 100 times over on reviews, but I can't get over how fun this game is to play. Take your typical grind-house movie, throw in a House of the Dead vibe, and some tunes that Quentin T. wished he could have used on Pulp Fiction (here and there anyway!) and you've got the makings of a laugh-out loud funny game.I was wondering how far the TV-MA rating would be taken. Rest assured, SEGA leaves no room for doubt...the profanity in the game (rumor has it that it made Guinness for the most profane game ever), the violence, and the somewhat near \"\"was that what I think I saw\"\" Janet Jackson moment definitely does NOT make this a game for the family. It's fun for me, though, when I would like to unwind after a hard day at work and want to do something else besides play Super Mario Galaxy.The banter between the straight-up well-tailored G and the foul-mouthed Detective Washington (who sounds like a dead-on Samuel L. Jackson impersonator) is great. G has his foul moments as well which makes it even funnier. The scene with the ice cream truck cracked me up beyond belief where G and Washington are debating music choices.Another fun moment is when Agent G and Washington find themselves on a little kiddie amusement park ride that moves around like Disney's Snow White through a haunted house...Washington blurts out (after G admits that he's a little scared to be on the ride), \"\"Are you holding my hand?!?\"\" \"\"Yes.\"\" \"\"Let go of me (string of expletives).\"\"So how does the remastered version of this game compare to the original Wii version?  It's well worth the ride in my opinion.  This is not a mere upscale exercise, mind you; they actually went in and dressed up the sets and characters completely.  Agent G had dark sunglasses in the original Wii version; in the PS3, he has yellow-tinted gun glasses and actually looks pretty decent with eyes for a change.  While the frame rate used to take a hit on the Wii if you had loads of zombies and rapid gunfire, the PS3 handles it without a fuss. Like the Wii version, the simulated film scratches and pops actually add to the feel that you're watching a real 35mm B-movie that occasionally jumps as if the film were about to tear loose of its sprockets.  The environments are pretty well done and the variety of gore does take into account where you're hitting the zombies...and the gore looks better than ever.Better still, Varla Guns has a couple of additional levels along with a stripper sidekick - it helps to tell the story between the stories in the original and often with hilarious (and quite adult) results.  I haven't laughed out loud at a game in quite awhile.  While the original Wii version was pretty funny, these additional levels didn't feel like they were tacked on.  They looked great...and man, they are funny.Yet another aspect to the game was the Move controller implementation.  The original Wii version had a similar point-and-shoot approach (and occasionally shaky at that), but the Move controller felt very tight and extremely responsive.  If you're fortunate enough to have the Playstation Move shooter, you're in even better luck because you don't have to swing the Move controller \"\"off-screen\"\" to reload.  Simply pump the shooter and you can reload without ever having to keep eyes off target.Sadly, I don't have a 3D screen to evaluate that aspect of the game, but it is 3D enabled if you so choose to play that way.If you liked the original Wii version, you'll LOVE this one.  If you own the Move and the official PS3 shooter attachment, trade your Wii version in and pick this one up.  This was really how the game was meant to be played.\"", "Awesome game. While PlayStations' Move accessories aren't very accurate, they're good enough to play this game. It's a lot of fun. I was reminded of my younger days in which I would spend all of my quarters playing this in the arcade.", "\"Originally released on the Wii, House of the Dead: Overkill gets an \"\"Extended Cut\"\" treatment here for the PS3, and we should all be glad that it has.  The game has undergone a bit of a graphical makeover, added some extra features, and now supports the Playstation Move as well as 3-D visuals.  Other than all that, it's pretty much the same game that hit the Wii a while back (and wasn't nearly as appreciated as it should have been then), but it's still boat loads of gorey fun.  The grindhouse-style presentation, ridiculously bad dialogue, and overall balls-to-the-wall feel of the game is intact, and remains the best House of the Dead game to come along in quite some time.  All in all, if you missed out on this game when it was on the Wii and you love some old school light-gun shooting action, pick this up, you'll be glad that you did.\"", "\"This is an HD port of the underappreciated Wii title, and now includes a couple extra stages, new weapons and game modes.The game, like all the House of the Dead games, is pure joy to play, especially with 2 players using Move controllers with gun attachments.  Each stage is set up as an episode of a 1970's style grindhouse film, complete with the over-the-top language, violence and even \"\"technical difficulties\"\"!  Action is fast and furious, enemy design is awesome, and the music in particular is quite good....really no complaints to speak of as far as the game itself goes.  It's a bit on the short side, which may be cause for some to wait for a price drop.  For me, the game was easily worth $20, and I would definitely support the developers releasing some DLC for this game.Technically, there are very few hiccups.  The Move controller requires some occasional recalibrating during gameplay, but this is remedied in seconds by holding down the select button, which will quickly re-center your aiming reticle.  The graphics and sound remastering are very well done...everything looks and sounds great.House of the Dead: Overkill is an excellent title that is really entertaining to play, especially with two players.  The grindhouse-esque presentation of the game is right on the money, and is good for lots of laughs as well as exciting gameplay.  The game is a much more enjoyable experience when utilizing a Move controller, and much closer to the classic arcade experience, so it is highly recommended that that control scheme is utilized.\"", "This game isn't reeking of quality, it's full of silly antics, ridiculous boss fights and intentionally bad voice acting. And it's great if you appreciate those things. It's just a standard rail shooter with humor at its core.  Plenty of collectables to look for, more levels than most rail shooters have, I really enjoyed the weapon upgrade system and the environments are awesome.My 1 star complaint has to do with the Playstation Move controllers. It's pretty hard to calibrate those things to work how you want them to. I almost feel like the Wii version did a slightly better job with the aiming calibration.But, once you get it working in a way you like, it works great.I highly recommend cheap gun attachments.For the price, if you already have a PS move, this is a must have to get some good use out of them.Also - The 3d support of this game is pretty solid. If you happen to have a 3D TV definitely turn 3D on in the game.", "\"This was a pretty fun & unique game, albeit short (took me about 6 hours to beat the story mode).  I only paid $5 for it on PSN so it was worth it...not sure I'd pay full price for such a short game.  My only complaint was the CONSTANT use of the \"\"F\"\" word.  And I mean constant...like every other word in the game.  I'm not offended by swearing--I do it all the time myself--but it got really grating after a while.  I also wish there was some way to skip the cut scenes.\"", "If you like killin zombies this PS3 MOVE game is for you. This game made me invest in a PS# MOVE rifle and 2 Guns just so I could &#34;get at those zombies&#34;. Great game.", "\"This game defines FUN! Yes, it's a screwball, over-the-top rip-off of Grindhouse -- but who doesn't want to play a screwball, over-the-top rip-off of Grindhouse? If you answered, \"\"I don't!\"\" this game isn't for you. For everyone else? This game is pure perfection.So why the 4 stars? Because the developers had 2 years to work on this after the Wii version and they only added 2 fun -- but short (shorter than usual) -- levels. It's ridiculous that at least 3 or 4 new levels couldn't be added. Or, at the very least, 2 very LONG levels exclusive to the PS3.The other thing I don't like is that you have the option to play it with a traditional controller. This is a \"\"light-gun\"\" game -- play with a traditional controller and you pretty much miss everything. This is for the Move and for the Move only. And if you play with the Move? You'll have a BLAST (literally).I can't explain why this game is so much fun (seriously, I can't -- if I did, my review would be censored). I can just say that I played through it on the Wii at least 3 times and, so far, I've played through the PS3 version by myself twice and with my girlfriend once, with my mom (yes -- my mom) once and with a couple of friends! I have went through this game 9 times (6 times on the PS3, alone)!What does the Move bring to the game? Far more accuracy, for a start. The Move wand (or whatever that sno-cone lookin' thing is officially called) is far more accurate than the Wiimote. The aforementioned 2 new levels (both fun, but, as I said, both short) and 3D.If you have a 3DTV, put them glasses on and be transported back to the earliest days of 3D horror! This is House of Wax stuff (the Vincent Price version). Sega did a GREAT job adding EXTREME 3D to this game. Stuff flies out at you. Bosses scream, stick their ugly heads out of the screen and essentially push their nasty fingernails into your face. It's awesome, if you're into that sorta stuff. And if you're playing this game ... you are.House of the Dead: Overkill - Extended Cut isn't everything it could have been. Online play would have been the icing on the cake. A couple more exclusive new levels would have brought up the value. But this game, as it is, can be played again and again with friend after friend (not to mention your girlfriend and your mother, if they're not prudes).My only other complaint is it's already a few bucks less than when I bought it. But that's all the better for you! If you like horror. If you like cheese. If you like grindhouse. If you have a steady hand and good aim? Well, what are you waiting for? This game proves, once again, that the Move controller for the PS3 is the greatest motion controller of all time. Plop down your cash now. Do it!\"", "I owned the Nintendo Wii version and this PS3 version is far superior than the nintendo wii version! Works great with the playstation move shooter gun!", "\"+ PROS:+ Hours upon hours of shooting mutants (don't say the `Z` word!)+ Hilarious grindhouse themes for all 9 chapters+ Several different gameplay modes and weapons to unlock+ Dialogue and rail-shooter elements share an equal level of enjoyment+ Online leaderboards- CONS:- Weak points of Bosses are not highlighted in battle like the Wii version- Some violence was toned DOWN from the Wii version...???- Minigun \"\"drift\"\" issuePLOT:AMS Agent G (no, we don't know what that stands for) and hard-boiled cop Isaac Washington reluctantly join forces on a mission to bring down Papa Caesar and save Bayou City. One is seeking justice, the other is seeking revenge. Will they save the day? Can they protect Varla Guns from a fate worse than death? Do they ever get to use an elevator that doesn't cause Isaac to get weak in the knees?You'll have to find out for yourself. Shoot to kill, Columbo, not to maim!GAMEPLAY:This game is a rail shooter. The player is limited to moving the gun crosshairs across the screen while the game follows a specific path. During the level, you can shoot hidden goodies like comic books, figurines, soundtrack records and posters, but your main goal is to shoot mutants...and lots of them. Shooting several mutants in a row without missing or taking damage increases your score multiplier until you earn a Goregasm...and then the points really start racking up.This game is NOT for the kiddies because of the violence, and also the language. The Wii version set a record for having 189 uses of the F-word (and I don't mean Fahrvergn&uuml;gen), and since there are 2 additional levels in the PS3 version, there's definitely more cussin' to be heard here.Kill those mutants any way you can; whether you throw a grenade, blast a shotgun, or drop a chandelier on them!!!PROS:+ Simply put, I never got tired of shooting mutants in this game. Whether with one Move controller or two, it's so much fun to play through, even if you're not trying to earn trophies or high scores.+ Each chapter felt like its own grindhouse film. From the cheesy acting to the hammy dialogue to the scratch marks on the cutscenes, we feel like we're saving the world a laPlanet Terror.Whether you play as the scorching hot Varla Guns or those testosterone death machines Agent G/Isaac Washington, you'll have a great old time.+ There are a few upgrades from the Wii version - In addition to Director's Cut mode, there's a mode where all the mutants can only die from headshots, a mode where you can only bring along a partially-upgraded Magnum, and my personal favorite, a mode called Shoot the Sh*t, where you have to shoot out all the naughty words at the bottom of the screen during each cutscene.Since it's easier to earn money in the PS3 version (really...MUCH EASIER), purchasing and upgrading guns is a simpler task. Plus, there are more weapons that weren't available in the Wii version.+ I will also add that the gameplay balances well with the dialogue. I keep chuckling at the foul-mouthed banter between Agent G and Isaac, and the 2 additional levels with Varla Guns and Candi Stryper are a welcome addition. Shooting mutants is fun, but if you skip the cutscenes, you're missing out on some comedic gold.+ The Online Leaderboards are another incentive to keep getting better at the game. You can try to beat your own score, or beat the scores of other people across the vast reaches of the intertubez.- CONS:- In the Wii version of House of the Dead: Overkill, each boss had clearly marked weak points. During battle, those weak points were surrounded by a red circle. In the Playstation version, we get a brief drawing of their weak points before the fight, but that's it.Sometimes the drawing doesn't mention the best weak points, such as the Lobber boss on \"\"The Fetid Waters\"\" level.- In planning this review, I went back and played through the Wii version again. By doing so, I noticed that quite a few scenes of extreme violence were toned DOWN when this game got ported over to the Playstation 3. For example: in the basement of Papa's Palace of Pain, mutants are putting a human corpse into a wood chipper, and twitching legs are shown in the Wii version, but this is censored in the PS3 version. During the \"\"Jailhouse Judgement\"\" level, a human police officer is hung from the jailhouse tiers, but this is not present in the PS3 version.I will agree that the PS3 version has more blood and more strippers, but not necessarily more gore than the Wii version.- I noticed that the minigun, while a fantastic weapon, had a problem with \"\"Move Drift\"\". The crosshairs drifted to the right or left of the screen if I held down the trigger for more than 2 continuous seconds. I turned off the magnetic sensor in the XMB settings and this helped a little, but I found the best solution was to simply fire short bursts with the Move controller and there was much less drift.Pressing the select button returns the crosshairs to the center of the screen, but this isn't always possible in the middle of a firefight.TROPHIES:There are 39 trophies to earn. Most of the basic trophies are earned by beating each stage, collecting and unlocking hidden items throughout the stages, purchasing all weapons, etc. Once Director's Cut mode is unlocked, each stage offers 7 additional challenges and these trophies are harder to earn. With practice and skill, you'll become a better shot. Enjoy your blood-soaked bullet-fest quest for the Platinum trophy!!!FINAL THOUGHTS:This was a very fun game to play, and I'm not the biggest fan of rail-shooters! I played it through multiple times with the Playstation Move and I didn't even THINK about using the DualShock controller.The calibration process was simple, the action was non-stop, the dialogue was hilarious, and the \"\"Missing Reel\"\" being restored for this version was the icing on the cake. Even though there was some gore missing and the Move wasn't perfectly calibrated, I could overlook those issues.If you're a fan of rail shooters, this game should definitely be in your library. Highly recommended!\"", "I recently picked up the Goldeneye Reloaded bundle that included the Playstation Move, and I shortly afterward picked up House of the Dead: Overkill due to the great responses the Wii version got. I am quite pleased with my purchase. This game has all the fun of the classic House of the Dead arcade games, but with an awesome, dirty coat of grindhouse cinema paint. This game is a throwback not only to the glory days of arcade gun games, but also a throwback to the exploitation films of the 1970s. Foul language, ridiculous one-liners and over-the-top violence are everywhere, and the new aesthetic fits the House of the Dead franchise perfectly.This game is a must-own if you have a Move. It's great for parties or for just getting a blast from the past. I highly recommend playing it with aSony Playstation Move Shooting Attachmentor aPlayStation Move Sharp Shooter, for a more authentic arcade experience. Me and my friends have spent many a night playing this game till the wee hours of the morning, and I'm sure you will too.", "I like this game! I bought a PS Move and a gun attachment just for the soul purpose of playing this game. Alot of F bombs in this game from Isaac so if you're a parent and are thinking about buying this game for your child, you might want to push mute during the cut scenes. lol. Also there's alot of violence and gore. I've never played the Wii version but this one is obviously the version to get because of it's improved graphics and sound and a few bonus features so i might not even bother getting it for the Wii. I'm about half way through the game but the stages arent that long and the bosses repeat their tactics making it easy to defeat them. It's a fast paced game with a variety of different looking zombies. I'm playing it alone but i'm sure it's a blast with 2 players. This is the kind of game that you could spend a weekend playing and enjoying with a few buddies. It's a straight arcade style game of course and you don't move the character which can be a pain at times because sometimes i see special items i could shoot but the character moves around so much that i miss out on alot of them. Replay value is little to none. I mean you can play through to save up enough money to get all the guns in the game and unlock some 3d models but after that, this is a game that will be played every now and then. The comedy in the game is somewhat funny. It's like a cheesy C list parody of any or every zombie movie that's ever been made. The environments and levels look pretty cool. It's easy to calibrate the PS Move controller and yes, you can play this game with the regualar PS3 controller but it's not highly recommended because it's just not as fun when playing the game that way. Anyways, i bought this game for like 15 bucks and it's definitely worth the price in my opinion."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.05345556512475014, 0.0015391666674986482, 0.005810505244880915, 0.09461760520935059, 0.13077302277088165, 0.11108832061290741, 0.0013449115213006735, 0.08547436445951462, 0.012216160073876381, 0.020642081275582314, 0.004256182815879583, 0.22357401251792908, 0.16000953316688538, 0.07810736447572708, 0.015444447286427021, 0.0016468444373458624]]}
