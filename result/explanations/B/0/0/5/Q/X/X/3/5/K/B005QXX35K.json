It has enough room for my laptop, a 10&#34; device like a Kindle or Ipad, (which I don't have), I carry my wires, cables, several Memory Sticks, a 500gb portable hard drive and my charger. Everything fit perfect without being over stuffed and it keeps it's shape well. Provides adequate padding and the stitching is well applied.The only reason I didn't rate it 5-stars is because this is my second bag. I bought a 14.0 inch laptop and the bag for a 14.1 was too small. This bag (a 15.6&#34; laptop bag) fits my 14&#34; perfectly. I don't believe my ASUS laptop is any thicker or larger than any other typical laptop, I think these bags, although really nice, are just made a little too small. I suggest buying one size larger than what you need.", "I was looking for a laptop bag with a small footprint for air travel. This bag definitely fits the bill. I was a little concerned about padding and room for accessories though.Once received the bag, I was immediately pleased with the thick padding on both side walls. It's by no means heavy armored or rigid, but this bag looks like it can take a bump or two without fear. I am using a Alienware Mx14 laptop and (as an artist) I also carry a Wacom Intous 4 Drawing Pad in my bag (PTK-640) and the Wacom while being a little tight fits perfectly without issue on the inside pocket next to my alienware. I also have 2x Western Digital Essential 2TB external hard drives (stacked up sideways on top of each other) that both fit on the deep inside pocket of the case next to the laptop on the opposite side. I also can fit my Razor mouse off the side of the drives inside the bag. All wires and extra power pack + accessories fit on the outer zipper pocket behind the flap.As you can imagine, that is a lot of stuff and yes it all fits in there. I am not saying it's a lean fit, but there is still room to spare for more actually. The other side of case has a open non zipper pocket good for magazines, boarding pass or other lose documents.In the end this is still way less bulky than my last big laptop bag. Granted the last bag was roomier and had rigid border frame to prevent heavy damage. However, if you plan on carrying your laptop with you on your person all the time... you likely will be babying your electronics anyway. I would only use that other bag again if I planned on checking my laptop bag through baggage claim (and I would never do that anyway).This slimmer bag seems like a perfect fit for my needs. If you are in market for a slim, well padded bag with surprisingly flexible inner space, put this bag on your radar to compare with others.", "\"Trust the description when it says that this is an \"\"understated attach&eacute;.\"\"  It is nice and functional, but perhaps a little too utilitarian. There is a 1/2 inch of padding for the laptop so it remains thin and it is impossible to over stuff.  The tablet pocket is a nice addition, probably better for bigger tablets like the iPad, a Kindle Touch gets lost in the pocket.The construction is ok, but the materials seem a little rigid for my tastes.  The strap is workable, but not luxurious.  The handle like the other materials is a little rigid and I don't know how much it will improve with age.Also, the price seems a little high for the bag.  It is listing for $50 right now.  I expect that to drop appreciably in the near future, but for now it is pretty pricey for what you get.All this being said, it is not a bad laptop bag.  It does serve the purpose that I was hoping for - to lug around my 13.3 macbook.  It does that well enough, but it lacks elegance.  So, if you are looking for function over form, this might be the bag for you.\"", "This is a very plain laptop bag.  No frills here, but it does deliver good quality construction and simplicity.  You don't have much extra room for other stuff here, though.  Just a laptop, power supply and a few odds and ends.", "Does a great job protecting an iPad and a few accessories, while remaining light. No excess bulk to speak of, sleek and stylish. Also will fit a laptop of up to 15.6 inch screen size. Too many tablet cases lack straps and/or handles, but this understated black number does both right without being overkill. Very nice.", "\"Hubby puts his 15\"\" laptop and his iPad 2 in this case and there's little room leftover, so keep that in mind if you were also hoping to put a few other things in this bag.  Minimal protection, but my husband doesn't make a habit of swinging his laptop case around and bashing into things, so the protection this has is good enough.  He takes it to work and it looks good and professional, and the padded part on the strap keeps the strap from digging into my neck when I carry it around.  It's a good price and it does what it's supposed to do, and all the stitching and materials are good and sound.\"", "My laptop fits in this bag perfectly.  I like how it has a decent amount of padding so it doesn't get damaged in my travels.  There are some pockets for other stuff, but if you use them, the beg tends to get bulky and looks like it is overflowing fast.  There aren't any metal components to this bag, other than the zipper, and the plastic clasps are holding up fine (but maybe should have been made out of metal for added strength).  Overall, the bag looks sharp and meets my needs.", "With the MLA-116 by Case Logic, they have created a well built, and quite useful case for tablet and laptop users. The construction is typical of Case Logic quality, meaning its not going to have any durability issues. The case is well thought out in the placement of pockets and pouches. This case sports a very handsome look to it, and a nice size carrying strap and handle that support a fully loaded case well without being too bulky or too fragile feeling. There really isn't much else to say about it, except that its a well designed case that suits a variety of purposes.", "I've found this bag to be very useful!  I did use it several times for what it's made for---carrying a laptop and iPad.  We went away for a weekend and found it was great to be able to carry both items so easily.  The ipad fits perfectly in the spot for it, snugly but not too snugly.  There is lots of room left for a laptop, and a nice amount of other places to store things like pens or styluses, and an outside pocket for easy access.I've also taken to using the bag for trips out of the house with the kids.  Sometimes I bring the iPad and fill the rest with snacks, extra clothes, etc, and sometimes I don't bring the iPad at all---just use the whole thing for necessities of a city trip with 3 kids!  I've found the attache is just the right size for this, and the shoulder strap has rubberized parts so it's far easier to keep on my shoulder than other such bags.  It just feels easy and right to carry.  It looks good too---professional and classy---not always my look, but I like it!I would not hesitate at all to recommend this great product.", "\"The description here does not offer much info, so let me delve into that:Both the front, back and sides are padded.Under the front velcroed flap (the photo with the logo the right) is a zippered pocket.  This pocket is 15.5 inches wide by 9 inches deep.  Along the back of this pocket are 3 elastic loops for pens and three smaller pockets, one 4.5 inches by 4 inches and two 3.5 inches by 4 inches.  These pockets are \"\"flat\"\" so whatever you put in them needs to be thin.The large middle pocket is 15.5  inches wide and 12 inches tall.  The bottom is 2 inches wide.  Inside this large pocket is a full length and nearly full depth divider that is flat against the side.  Along the other side is a 9 inch wide by 10.5 inch pocket with a lined (fuzzy) front.  I guess that fuzzy fabric is called \"\"nylex\"\".Along the back outside near the handles is a small zippered pocket that is 6 inches wide and 5 inches deep, lined with the fuzzy material (would be good place for a phone or Ipod).  Also along the back side is an 8.5 inch tall non closing pocket that runs the whole width of the case.The straps are attached with plastic clip hooks to nylon webbing loops and the handle is padded.This is a well made case, although I have some concern about the nylon webbing durability over time.  However, I have had other Case Logic bags that lasted for a long time, so I will give the developers the benefit of the doubt.  The zippers work smoothly and have nice pulls.  I think the front long pocket should have had some sort of closure in the middle, a piece of Velcro or a snap to keep the contents from falling out.  The price/value point seems a bit high as well.\""], "Gamma": [0.44460058212280273, 0.5553994178771973], "Beta": [[0.022832263261079788, 0.043185051530599594, 0.013672986067831516, 0.05363665521144867, 0.03641674295067787, 0.033819738775491714, 0.017871947959065437, 0.016446849331259727, 0.7542757391929626, 0.007842025719583035], [0.02277214266359806, 0.043180160224437714, 0.013548452407121658, 0.05369168147444725, 0.03609799966216087, 0.03336327150464058, 0.01785149611532688, 0.01645759493112564, 0.7552339434623718, 0.007803265005350113]]}
