"], "reviews": ["I am typically wary of most bars because many people automatically assume they are healthy, low calorie, etc. If one does turn out to be healthy, that does not mean you can eat them unfettered and without restraint.While I typically tend to stick with protein-heavy bars, sometimes a little change can be good and sometimes you want a lower calorie snack (most protein bars hover in the 200 range).  These bars have 100 calories but are considerably smaller than I expected. As such, they certainly should not be considered a meal replacement but a snack only.I absolutely cannot stand for a bar to be bland, dry or have an aftertaste.  I was glad to try out a bar with caramel (yum!) and chocolate along with the nuts. I was disappointed, however, to find these bars had a few questionable ingredients, such as fractionated oil & natural flavor. You are going to find unhealthy ingredients in most manufactured foods, and I tend to look over the lesser evils on occasion.Regardless, for a quick, lower calorie snack, I think these would work for most people.  I love caramel so this made the bar a little more appealing to my palate, but I am not fond of having so much sugar in such a small item. I would consider buying them on occasion, moreso for my teenaged son, as they are still healthier than regular candy bars.I do think the bars are a little pricey for the quantity of food you are receiving. I can purchase good protein bars on sale for the same price.Although this item was sent to me to evaluate for the Amazon Vine program, I always provide honest reviews based on my own opinion for all items (Vine & non-Vine). I also look at the price of the item and comment on that as well when applicable, based on whether or not I would purchase the item on my own.", "\"No, these are not the healthiest things out there but as a little \"\"healthy\"\" pleasure, they fit the bill. If you want help resisting a candy bar and want to splurge without eating a Snickers bar, this is a satisfying substitute. When I was a kid my mom made a delicious dessert out of pulverized mint candies, whipped cream, and chocolate wafers. This bar reminded me of that dish in flavor and even in the crunchiness of the chocolate \"\"pebbles\"\" in the middle. I thought this tasted great, and in a weak moment I would definitely reach for one.\"", "I've been on a diet for about 1.5 months and in that time span, I've lost just under 20 pounds.  I'm trying to cut down on sugar and junk food, but every now and then you have a itch that just has to be scratched.  Do you know what I mean?So these bars have a really nice flavor with a solid dose of chocolate.  Yet they aren't jam-packed with sugar and at only 100 calories per bar, you are not going to feel overly guilty eating one.I am not really so much into mint either, but I do like the minty taste of these South Beach bars.  The mint is nicely integrated with the dark chocolate and is not &#34;overly minty&#34;.These bars are enjoyable and I was sorry when the box was empty.  5 stars.", "I have enjoyed several other South Beach products, I had high hopes for this little bar. I really was excited to receive it for a Vine review, but I must admit, I was not so excited once I ate one. Its ok...its not that its BAD, its just ok. I felt it was sub standard to the other SB bars I have tried in the past, I am thinking this particular product will have a short run then be replaced by a newer kind of little snack bar. I personally would not recommend.", "This snack bar actually tasted pretty yummy. It is small, but has real ingredients and no fake sugars. It makes a great treat for when you want a little something sweet without killing the waistline.There are only 5 per box, so it could get pricey if you have one everyday.Nevertheless, for a diet snack bar, it is tasty and chocolate-y.", "These are the kind of bars that are perfect to stash at work, in your purse or in a gym bag for a quick snack.  They are maybe 2/3 the size of a regular granola size bar, more akin to a weightwatcher bar if you are familiar with their snacks.  The bar is 100 calories with no artificial flavors or sweeteners.  35 calories are from fat, (10% saturated), no cholesterol, 85 mg of sodium, 95 mgs of potassium, 5 g sugar, 6 grams of protein and 6g of fiber.  Calcium weighs in at 10% and iron at 8%.Now for the taste....hubby loves chocolate and mint together, so he gave a two thumbs up and said, yes, buy them again!  I didn't think they were quite at a girl scout cookie level of scrumptiousness, but thought they were pretty darn good and not too sweet or too mint heavy.  I too would purchase/eat them again.Overall, if you need a quick snack or are trying to watch your intake of calories, these may be just the trick to take the edge off your hunger!", "\"These snack bars are quite fresh with an expiration date of 09/30/2014. They are small bars measuring 1\"\" X 3\"\" and weighing less then 5 ounces. These could have been a 5 star item but the mint was so strong that it just jumped out and slammed you with mint overdose. I recently purchased a chocolate/mint product which had a pleasant taste that blended nicely with the chocolate. However, the mint in these snack bars is far too overpowering for me to enjoy. The snack bars have a modest 100 calories which is to be expected based on their very small size. Without the excessive mint these would be very good but as it is I will not eat the remaining four bars.\"", "The SB Diet Chocolate Caramel Peanut Snack bar is reasonably sized for 100 calories. It's larger than the similar Weight Watcher's bars.  The chocolate itself doesn't have the texture or melt quite the way you'd hope - there's a bit of waxiness in the texture.  The taste is okay. I was surrounded by Halloween candy and it helped to have this as a high protein low calorie alternative.  For 100 calories, it's a reasonable satisfying snack.  Though it doesn't really feel like a  real chocolate bar, it is what it is - a low calorie alternative.", "If you are looking for a snack that will fill you up, these are perfect.  I could seldom finish a whole one.  They are very satisfying when you really need a munch.However, if you are looking for a delicious snack . . . this isn&#8217;t it.  I found the taste bland.  They have a very pleasant aroma that promises much, but doesn&#8217;t quite deliver.  Edible, okay, but not exactly scrumptious.  I did like the texture, with a bit of a crunch on the bottom and a substantial feel to them.If you are seriously on a diet and really need something to hold you over until dinner, these are good.", "I've been checking out South Beach bars every time they create a new one, and so far, including this bar, I have not been disappointed. This is a bar with fiber and protein, so it is less likely to raise your blood sugar than a candy bar. Though it isn't a lot of food, it satisfies your hunger when you are on the go and have no time for a meal--or you are hungry between meals and don't want to eat too many calories.These bars taste great. If you like sweet, it is quite sweet. It is chewy and crispy at the same time, kind of a healthy version of a Snickers type candy bar. I would definitely turn to this bar when I get a craving for chocolate, because the chocolate taste is terrific.This particular product is packaged as a snack bar versus a meal bar, meaning that the gross calories are only 100 (actually only 76 minus the fiber) instead of 200 or so calories in some of the South Beach meal bars.Finally, and possibly most important, even though I am hyper-sensitive to fiber, the fiber in this bar does not cause me any discomfort.Ingredients: Soy protein isolate, chicory root fiber, sugar, fractionated palm kernel, palm oil, tapioca syrup, soluble corn fiber, peanuts, agave syrup, water, cocoa processed with alkali, glycerine, tapioca starch, nonfat milk, natural flavor, lactose, salt, soy lecithin, dextrose.WARNING: Contains milk, soy, peanuts, processed on equipment that also praocesses tree nuts, egg, wheat, sesame.Nutrition Facts:Fat: 4 gm (no trans fats)Carbohydrate: 15 gm (6 gm fiber)Protein: 6 gmTotal Calories: 100 (net 76 minus fiber)", "These snack bars are good, but nothing really exciting. I much prefer the Atkins bars, but these are fine in a pinch. The chocolate isn't nearly as rich as the chocolate Atkins uses. These bars are designed for snacking rather than a whole meal, so they are smaller and don't satisfy for as long, but they're tasty. The nuts are finely-ground, so they lack a satisfying crunch, but they taste good. I can recommend these bars as a healthy snack, but can't jump up and down about them overall.", "If offered the choice between nothing and these South Beach Diet Chocolate Caramel Peanut Snack Bars I'd take these South Beach bars. However, if the offer included any other food options I'd give these bars a pass.These taste almost exactly like you asked someone to make a chocolate, caramel and peanut snack who had never tasted chocolate, caramel or peanuts.The chocolate has that distinct diet chocolate bitterness and grainy, gritty mouth feel. The caramel is... very thin, almost oily with almost no caramel flavor whatsoever. The peanuts {shudder} have you ever gotten that one chocolate covered peanut that's almost soft, sort of squeaks and has a weird, bitter flavor that just fills your whole mouth? Every peanut in the bar is just like that.If you've never tasted chocolate, caramel or peanuts you might enjoy these. However if you're dieting and think you've forgotten what these items taste like you will be disappointed.I'd eat them... but only if there was nothing else to eat.", "Chocolate mint is a popular flavor for diet snack bars.  I expected this would be like any other but actually I think it has a little bit nicer taste.  It's still a diet bar so you have to be realistic in your expectations but I found that this box disappeared pretty quick so I have to say it's a preferred snack bar for me.  The product description does not lie.. even those not watching their weight may like these so you might want to keep them out of sight!", "These remind me of Girl Scout Thin mint cookies. With 6 grams of protein and only 100 calories they are great snack. They have 6 grams of fiber and only 5 grams of sugar they taste like you're eating a candy bar. I had no lasting unpleasant fake sugar taste in my mouth after I ate them. I felt satisfied for about 2 hours after I ate the bar. I would purchase these bars again.", "When the package says product enlarged to show detail they're not kidding.  These snack bars aren't much bigger than a fun size baby ruth bar.  It also says no artifical flavors or sweeteners.  But then says simulated nuttiness; tapioca added; and tons of gum products and these tasted VERY artificial. It was like eating bitter taffy with gritty sand granules. They're only 6g protein, 6g fiber but 7g of carbs.  For the price all you're getting is 6 mini size bars.  Just eat two mini snickers and you'll satisfy your snack craving a heck of a lot cheapter. These were yuck.", "\"These seem awfully tiny--under 1oz.--for 100 calories.  The chocolate and caramel tasted good, but the nuts were ground into something that resembled a gritty sand more than peanuts.  They're decent enough, especially for a \"\"diet\"\" product, but I can definitely find tastier, larger/more satisfying alternatives for the 100 calories.  After consuming one, I'm still hungry.\"", "At 100 Calories per bar, I love these South Beach bars for a chocolate fix that won't ruin my diet.  6 grams of protein make these bars an especially great snack before or after a workout.The bars are smaller than a vending machine candy bar.  But what they lack in size, they make up for with a rich moist chocolatey taste.  If you're looking for a good snack bar that is a step up from just empty calories and sugar give these South Beach bars a try.", "These honestly tasted pretty bad.  The chocolate tastes artificial and has a bad consistency in your mouth.  The peanuts are bland are most likely left over stock from their supplier.  These are very chewy and have no natural aspects to them.  Very processed.I will say they slightly leave you full for a brief period of time so if that is your most important sticking point, you may want to try these.", "My first impression of the South Beach Diet Chocolate Caramel Peanut snack bar is that it is really SMALL. The bars weigh just slightly less than an ounce each, and are about the length of a stubby dry-erase pen, so a person would get three, perhaps four bites from each one. Fortunately, they are good bites. The bars have a slightly earthy, dark chocolate flavor complimented by the caramel which is sweet but not cloyingly sweet. Since I have spent the past few months avoiding extra sugars, I was happy to discover that this snack bar was not too sweet. Another plus is that it is chewy, and that texture helps in the satisfaction of eating it. With 6 grams of protein and only 100 calories, I found it a nice treat that did not make me feel as if I were breaking my diet regimen. Recommended.", "\"Over the years I've tried dozens of \"\"power\"\" bars and \"\"energy\"\" snack bars. Some taste terrible some are palatable and a few are good. I would put these in the \"\"good\"\" tasting category. They are a great snack source made with healthy ingredients and really a pretty good taste.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0450742244720459, 0.05084867402911186, 0.04480995982885361, 0.05389661714434624, 0.052550215274095535, 0.05152510479092598, 0.04742264375090599, 0.050394006073474884, 0.04374604672193527, 0.052642010152339935, 0.05095285177230835, 0.04793837293982506, 0.05332116037607193, 0.05260257422924042, 0.05010403320193291, 0.05182668939232826, 0.052228204905986786, 0.045415762811899185, 0.054875023663043976, 0.04782584309577942]]}
