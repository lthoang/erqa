The board shifting and movement is familiar, but mission cards and numbered objects have been replaced by an electronic \"\"book\"\" that instructs players what they need to do. It also doles out semi-random rewards and even occasional punishments, which really sets this game apart from its predecessors -- in both good and bad ways, depending on one's tastes.The basic gameplay is identical to that of most of the other Labyrinth games. Take the extra board tile and slide it into the maze shifting all the other tiles in that row or column, then move your character as far as you like along an unbroken path. You can pick up objects at the start or end of your move, but can only deliver an object at the end of your move. You can be pretty casual about things, or seriously consider your moves. There are lots of opportunities for clever play and for messing with the other players.The object is to collect a certain number of magical gems by making deliveries to the characters on the board. You can also gain gems by visiting the player start space on the opposite corner of the board, and sometimes by simply picking up gems that occasionally appear in certain spaces (as instructed by the \"\"book\"\").The random nature of the rewards makes this game a bit different from its predecessors, which are mostly deterministic. When one completes a delivery in Electronic Labyrinth, the reward varies. In fact, sometimes the Witch speaks up and something *bad* happens (e.g., lose a gem, or move your character to the Dungeon tile). This caused me to raise an eyebrow. Perhaps it serves to even things out between players of different abilities, but it can also be pretty annoying. I have yet to encounter anything overly harsh, so I don't think this is a huge issue. The book also offers occasional instructions along the lines of \"\"put a gem on each space that shows a gem bag\"\" or \"\"rotate the board 90 degrees.\"\"Another feature new to the series is that instead of trying to fulfill mission cards or collect objects in numeric order, as in the other Labyrinth games, players are assigned semi-random specific deliveries by the electronic book. Visit a character, and the character will request an object. Of course, *any* player can complete the mission, not just the player who triggered it. So there is a chance of inadvertently handing points to another player who might be in a better position to complete the task one just revealed. This game is probably the most cutthroat in the series. There are also some missions where the triggering player automatically receives a \"\"treasure chest\"\" piece to deliver to another character.The magic book is very cute -- the seven characters each tell their own stories and the voice acting is appropriately over the top. Kids will love it, and adults will be amused at first. The skip/ repeat button is a nice touch, allowing players to skip the intros and chit-chat and just hear the important stuff (e.g., \"\"Bring me the chalice!\"\" or \"\"Thank you, take two gems\"\") or to replay the most recent statement. Each character button will replay that character's current quest, which is important because otherwise it's a lot to remember, especially for kids. Cutthroat adult gamers wanting to test their memories can of course disallow repeats if they so choose.I won't be looking to play this in any tournaments, but it's a welcome addition to the collection for casual game nights and family play.\"", "\"My 11 year old took this to her friend's house and the kids had a blast listening to the instructions given by the magical \"\"book\"\". It is the same Labyrinth game we love, but in this electronic version it is the electronic voice inside the book that tells players what their missions are and how many jewels they get as awards. The electronic voices are varied and fun making the game more like a story-like progression. As with Ravensburger products, the box is very heavy ans sturdy and so are the pieces and components!\"", "\"We purchased the original Ravensburger Labyrinth game for my daughter as a gift.  I was really impressed with it both for its quality construction and for the level of play in encourages.  I was very pleased to see that this edition takes what was already a very solid game and adds an extra element that takes play to a new level.As with the non-electronic Labyrinth, the board has a few permanently attached pieces with a bunch of tiles that allow for randomized gameplay.  Before playing, the tiles should be placed facedown and shuffled and then picked up and placed in random spots on the board.  During gameplay, an extra tile is used to push a row of tiles around, shifting the maze and creating new dead ends and paths.  This makes moving around the maze very challenging, encouraging players to strategize and think elastically.  Both the board and tiles are made of very heavyweight cardboard and should hold up well to repeat play.What is added in the electronic version is the book.  Unlike with the original, the player doesn't simply move around the maze searching for certain items.  Instead, each player visits a \"\"dweller\"\" who gives them an assignment.  Sometimes they ask for a particular item, sometimes they ask the player to take a treasure chest to another dweller, and sometimes they ask the player to do both.  This makes things a bit confusing at times because you have to remember who you're running errands for, who you need to take the chest to, and what item you need to get.  However, you can press the dweller button on the book for a reminder.  Once you complete a mission, you press the appropriate buttons on the book and the dweller may reward you with gems, which are needed for a magic key to free the wizard--the object of the game.  Sometimes you're further rewarded by being granted an extra turn or move.From time to time, the evil witch will interrupt, taking your gem rewards away or making you lose a turn, etc.  This adds an extra element of challenge to the game.  Conversely, the wizard you're attempting to free may break in and ask you to place gems in certain spaces, which adds additional rewards.Each player also has a \"\"mission\"\" that they can complete.  This basically boils down to moving your game piece to the square that is directly across the board from you, diagonally.  If you complete the mission, you press the appropriate button on the magic book and are granted an additional reward.  This encourages further strategy because each player needs to decide if it's best to concentrate on completing their mission or on running errands for their dweller.My husband and I played with my eight-year-old daughter and we all enjoyed it.  She was occasionally frustrated by the challenges of moving around the board, but I like a game like this because it really encourages her to think in very creative ways.  I really can't say enough to praise Ravensburger games.  By now, we own several of them and I have purchased them as gifts for my nephew as well as recommending them to friends and relatives who are looking for games.\"", "My oldest son has wanted Labyrinth for some time now.  From what he says this game is different from the classic version.  Which I suppose is caused by needing to accomodate for the electronic controller in this game.  But he thinks this game is just as awesome and I think it is awesome because it holds the attention of both my 5 and 11 year olds.  There are not many games that can bridge that gap.The pieces seem well constructed, although I fear how many small game board pieces there are.  With young boys, pieces tend to dissappear quickly but after a few months they are still there. It is nice that the player pieces are little figurines.  The game controls are easy to understand and although I fear that the wrong buttons will get pressed and possibly mess up the game play, it is so straight forward we have not had any mishaps.  Game is easy to grasp and although there is the potential for strategy we seem to play at a pretty casual level.ProsFun gamePotential for higher levels of strategic thinkingkids are riveted to the voice coming out of the electronic booksliding gameboard pieces work welldecent constructionConsLots of pieces that can go missing3 AAA batteries needed, with an inconvenient set screw in the game controllersometimes easy to forget your questAll in all, I would recommend it to families with young kids.  It really does hold their attention and has seen considerable use in our home.  Just wish you could get the batteries in and out easier.", "\"The Amazon page for this game currently says it is for 2-6 players, but it is actually only for 2-4.  And the Amazon page says it is for ages 8-15, but the box says 8-99.  With a little help, much younger children will be able to play and will enjoy it (and there is nothing inappropriate for any age).  To help young players compete with older players, you may wish to allow them to \"\"jump\"\" across unconnected labyrinth pieces once per turn, if necessary.  Also, to accommodate young attention spans, you might want to start the game with more of the gem slots on the magic keys prefilled to shorten the game.The characters in the game seem to be drawn for a very young audience, and the voices  recorded in the \"\"book\"\" sound straight out of a cartoon aimed at very young children.  However, I think any age will enjoy this game.  My 12-year-old daughter, my 16-year-old son, and I all liked it.I appreciate that the gems are made from durable, translucent plastic, and are actually faceted like real gems.  I think little girls, in particular, will love the prettiness of these and will enjoy collecting them for their keys.  The manufacturer could have gone with cheap cardboard punch-outs instead, so this is a nice touch.  And the board, labyrinth cards, and other playing pieces are also well made.  The only disappointment here is that the sound quality from the book is not very good.  It sounds no better than the electronic games made 40 years ago.The instruction sheet is full color and illustrated, which is a good thing because the rules are rather complicated and there are so many different types of playing pieces.  I became a bit discouraged and frustrated when I first read them.  But after playing one time, everything we were confused about made sense.The suggested retail price of $50 is totally ridiculous, but the current price of $20 is a good value.  Even though the game is well made, I don't think it would be worth more than about $30.Overall, this is a quality game that will bring a lot of fun to your family game nights.\"", "Not going to go into details of the actual game as other reviewers have more than covered all that.I picked up the original version for our family game library years ago based on it winning the Game of The Year Award and being on numerous recommended lists. My kids loved it and it was well used game in our home. With the electronic version I felt trepidation due to the my experience with other classics (ie electronic monopoly) that have failed to deliver in the updated versions with batteries. Happily I can say that Ravensburger delivers with this one. Our family thoroughly enjoyed playing this version, and it is the first choice between the original and electronic.", "\"Having first been a fan of the original Labyrinth game, I was pretty excited to try the newest version.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.  The electronic twist to the game involves a \"\"magic\"\" book with various buttons and pre-recorded messages.  The book gives a little more variety and adds some objectives to the overall goal of the game.  However, I found those additions to the game to be silly and contrived.  Having said that, Electronic Labyrinth is still an entertaining and interesting game--probably more of a family game than an adults-only game.\"", "My 13 year old really enjoys this game.  Even the adults liked this one, not as challenging as the board games we usually play but still pretty fun!  Not too long to set up, and would have liked it more if we could have included more people, but still an interesting game and we liked the magical componets as well as the adventuring!  Recommended!", "The goal of this game is to collect enough magic gems to fill your magic key card and then unlock the magic book to free the captive wizard.  I played this game recently with my 7 year-old daughter.  I guess it was pretty fun because she immediately wanted to play again.  She said that she loved it.We have Jr. Labyrinth, which we enjoy playing occasionally.  We like this much better.  This game has more interesting and varied play.  A labyrinth is formed by various cards that are placed on the game board.  Game play involves manipulating the labyrinth by sliding cards on and off the board so that the maze is configured differently for each turn.  Players try to make a path to their next objective while trying to keep opponents from theirs.The electronic component of the game comes in the form of an electronic book with prerecorded messages from the evil witch, the captured wizard, and five other characters, who give you quests and rewards.  After finishing a quest and collecting a reward, the wizard or witch will randomly have you do something to the game board or the witch will punish you for crossing her.  The book adds some interest and randomness to this strategy game.  My daughter enjoyed hearing the messages of different characters.At first I thought it was going to be complicated to play.  And it is somewhat complicated to set up with all the labyrinth cards, objects, figures, treasure chests, quest cards, and gems.  However, once you play a few turns it is pretty easy to get the hang of.  My 3 year-old boy heard the electronic book and moseyed on over to see what we were doing.  He seemed interested so I may let him play with me as a team tomorrow.As with all of our other Ravensburger games, this game is of high quality with well-made, sturdy pieces.  It should have no problem pulling my kids away from their Kindles and Nintendos.  Highly recommended.", "\"This is a new addition to the Labyrinth series by Ravensburger. The addition of the \"\"magic book\"\" changes the nature of the game. It's not better or worse, just different. The book introduces an additional element of chance compared to the non-electronic versions of the game. The magic book also makes the game a little more complicated and I recommend following specified age recommendations.  With the non-electronic Labyrinth games you can often play with children a little younger than the stated ages, especially if they were introduced to the game mechanics on a junior version. Children will find the book entertaining. Adult players may find it annoying.The book assigns players missions and grants rewards in the form of gems. It tracks mission goals, but it does not keep track of players' progress. This still must be done manually. It was very easy to get the hang of using the book. The instruction are very clear and we were playing after 2 read throughs.I was skeptical, but ended up liking this version. It won't replace my regular Labyrinth game. It provides a new and enjoyable twist on an old favorite.As with all Ravensburger games, the quality is the highest possible. All pieces are thick and sturdy. The die cuts are clean. There were no defects at all. And everything has its proper place in the very sturdy box.In summary, this is a great game, especially for family game night. It's not a substitute or update for the regular Labyrinth game. It is a well designed addition to the series.\"", "\"At first I thought the amount of pieces (cards, gems, tokens, book) was just a little too much to corral in the face of playing this with three kids.  Once we got the board setup and walked through a turn, it all turned out fine.  The electronic part of the game really just consists of the book telling you which object to bring to which character.  It's pretty \"\"old school\"\" compared to today's \"\"electronics\"\", but it serves the purpose to engage the kids and make things a little more exciting.As far as game play: It took a while for them to get the strategy involved in shifting the maze to optimize their turn and to also look to impact other player's turns.  Once this clicked, the game became way more interesting as I could see the wheels turning in the kids head as they did mental \"\"what-ifs\"\".  The game did not take too long and the kids enjoyed it.  Engaged, happy kids + educational value = 5-star rating in my book (also, the quality of the game seems like it will take a lot of wear and tear).\"", "\"This is a fun adventure/strategy game where you are thrown in a dungeon by an evil witch.  Inside the dungeon the inhabitants give you a task, \"\"please bring me the chalice\"\".  You have to go pick up the item and bring it back to the requester.  In return for accomplishing a task you are given gems.  When you get enough gems to fill your key card, the key is active and can unlock the labyrinth freeing the captives.  There are a couple side quests as well; you can bring your secret document to the opposite corner of the square and some of the inhabitants have treasure chests they want you to deliver to other inhabitants.  Additionally during each person's turn you slide a card into one side of the labyrinth which changes the board drastically altering the paths you have to take to get from one part of the board to another.Sound confusing?  Well it's not.  My son is five years old and grasped the concept quickly.  It's a fun game because it's different every time.  It's fun to complete the little quests and my son really enjoyed collecting the treasure as well.  The best part is the electronic book tells you what to do so there is no reading, which makes it an accessible game for younger children.There are a couple of interesting educational opportunities.  Usually there are multiple quests going on at one time and this makes it so you have to remember what goes where; this is great for helping with memorization.  Although, fear not, you can always hit the character on the electronic book and it will let you know what item the character is waiting for.Secondly there is some strategy involved on where you place the tiles during your turn.  You need to place the tiles so you can get where you need to get but also so the other players have trouble completing their quest.  My son, at five years old, is just starting to grasp the strategy needed to place the tiles in the most advantageous positions.There are some fun quirky things in the game as well.  For instance if you take too long to bring an item back to a character, they'll give you grief about how it took you forever to bring it back.  Also occasionally the evil witch will speak up and steal your gems, throw you in the dungeon...something like that.There were a couple things that bothered me about the game.  When a character is talking you can't skip anything...so every time you play you have to listen to each character's full introduction about themselves.  Sometimes the witch tells you to rotate the labyrinth, which is just obnoxious and ridiculous...it doesn't change anything on the board and is a pain to do...so we usually skip this.  Lastly you have to play this game on a flat surface or the tiles won't slide right when you are inserting tile cards.Overall we've been very pleased with this game. It's a decent length, about 30-45 minutes for 3 players, and it is one of the few games that the 5 year and the adults all find interesting and enjoy. It teaches strategy and is accessible to the non-readers in the family.  The game is also different every time you play since it uses a tile based mentality.Highly recommended for those fantasy loving gamers who want a great game that will be accessible to and hold the interest of a broad age group.\"", "\"Grimelda has trapped the wizard Akata into a magic book, and it's up to you (the player) to free him! The game's instructions are a little confusing, but once you start to play everything becomes clear. I liked how the \"\"bad guy\"\" in the story talks to you and makes the game more challenging through various punishments, like locking you in the dungeon or making you lose some game winning gems. The game requires a bit of strategy and a lot of remembering which quest item each character wants. The game really makes you think and it is very entertaining. We had an 8 year old playing and she had no troubles at all, so the recommended ages are spot on. The game is basically ready to play out of the box, you just need 3 AA batteries for the magic book and some prep time to punch out cards and set up the board.\"", "\"I heard such good things about the original Labyrinth game that I jumped on the chance to get this. Having never played the original, this review will not include a comparison between the two. I will start off by saying my husband and I are somewhat into gaming though not really hardcore. We play Settlers of Catan, Citadels, Blokus, Qwirkle, Chess and Go. We've also played Agricola and Puerto Rico and while many people love the complexity of those games, my husband and I tend to be turned off by too many rules. We love something cerebral but simplistic. Elegant.That said, I liked this game. I think I liked it more than my husband did. When I opened the box, my initial impression was the game was very attractive with quality pieces. There's a slot for each kind of piece and everything is well organized. The fact that you can shift the maze and change the game board was pretty neat to me and the high fantasy element was fun.The first time we played it took over an hour because of reading the rules and understanding the game. The second time was a breeze because we had already figured out some shortcuts and cheats to manipulating the maze. I think it's not so complicated that going through the game is laborious, but there is just enough strategy involved that you're plotting and scheming though most of it.The electronic book is nice. It has the option of \"\"fast forwarding\"\" through the intro so that the characters aren't always introducing themselves. It was also fairly intuitive to use and blended seamlessly into play.Definitely will get lots of use out this game.Edited to add: I'm not sure why the Amazon product specs say this is a 2-6 player game. It is actually for 2-4 players.\"", "My boys liked this game because it reminded them of the interactive MagiQuest at Great Wolf Lodge.  The main difference between the two games is the Electronic Labyrinth Game is a board game (where you sit to play) and the MagiQuest at GWL involves a lot of actual running around to locate items on your quest.  Despite the lack of physical activity in this game, they actually enjoyed playing it.  We have never played the non-electronic version of this game so I cannot comment on how the two games compare.  I think this is a great gift idea and a good deal on sale at $20-$25.", "As soon as we got this my grandaughter wanted to play with it so we set it up and started playing. It was a little difficult to understand some of the rules but once we figured it out we were able to play more and enjoy it without checking on the rules. My grandaughter who is 12 was of course the winner and of course she loved that part as well as rescuing Akata from the evil witch Grimelda. If your kids love the wizards or such they will definitley love this game :)", "This toy is a good choice for 8-12 year olds who enjoy strategy games.  It would be too childish for most teens.  The object of the game is to fill your keycard with gems and then return to your starting position. Each player changes the configuration of the labyrinth on their turn trying to reach their goal and foil their opponent.The part of the game that will appeal to younger children, but will turn off older ones is the electronic book. The buttons are fun to push for younger kids.  The voices and directions are childish and get annoying after playing the game a few times.The instructions are well written and clear.  The game pieces are all well made and this game should last a long time.", "\"We've never played a Labyrinth type game and were excited to get this one.If the instructions were a little more clear, that would have been helpful. We wondered from the pictures in the instructions if we were missing a treasure chest or when the labyrinth dwellers said to take a treasure chest to another player, we weren't sure if they meant their own treasure chest or the treasure chest of the intended recipient.Other than trying to figure out the directions for a while, once we started playing, the kids found it a lot of fun. It's great to have a board game where you don't have to roll dice to be able to move your player piece. The kids had to figure out how to move the labyrinth to their advantage and how to navigate the maze.I do like how you can make the game more difficult or easy depending on which maze pieces you place on the board. That let's us make the game more difficult as time goes on.The plastic \"\"book\"\" that it comes with gives instructions when you push the buttons. Just be careful to press the correct button as we've accidently hit the wrong one when playing. In the game, you \"\"deliver\"\" items to the different dwellers in the labyrinth. You press the dweller's button on the book and then have to wait for them to finish talking, then you press the hand (to deliver an object) or the wooden chest (to deliver a treasure chest).Fun game for kids and adults.\"", "\"I'm a big fan of Ravensburger and especially of Labyrinth. The regular Labyrinth is great across a wide age range, and of all the games that I play with my kids, it is among the most enjoyable. Labyrinth, however, is not a game where one says, \"\"You know, this game would be so cool if we could make it electronic.\"\" I would wager that this version began merely as a push to expand the Labyrinth franchise and compete against all the other classic board games that now require batteries. In the process of adding electronics, however, the game's rules and actions have become unwieldy. It is no longer fun. In fact, the constant back and forth between the electronic directives and the slow execution of tasks on the board have sucked all the fun out of Labyrinth.If you don't have Labyrinth in your house and you have young kids, I encourage you to think about getting the game. But don't buy this version (buythis one).Cheers\"", "The entire family wanted to enjoy Labyrinth. The game pieces are cute and sturdy, and I like the idea of being able to change the game by sliding the tiles that make up the labyrinth.What ruins this game are the rules, which make it far too confusing. You set up a random labyrinth, and in each turn, you have to slide a tile into the labyrinth, which moves one line of tiles. This part is straight forward enough. You then get to move your piece. You can move to a place where you pick up a free gem, to an object you can pick up in order to complete a quest, to a character who will either send you on a quest or accept the object you were previously sent on a quest to retrieve, or to a piece on the opposite side of the board from where you started where you can pick up gems. Different characters will send you to different places to retrieve different objects and will sometimes ask you to carry treasure to other characters. At any point in the game, you can only have one treasure and one object, although you might be trying to bring multiple items to multiple characters. At the same time, other players are also trying to bring other objects to other characters, or possibly the same characters. You win by collecting enough gems by either just picking them up, or completing tasks or missions. Confused yet? We were.The strangest thing about the game is the disconnect between the cuteness of the physical game and the convoluted nature of the rules. There's a talking book that sends you on your quests. Land on the adorable unicorn, for example, and you have to click on the unicorn button on the book. The unicorn will then tell you in a children's storyteller voice what it wants you to do. This thing is so cute and reminiscent of MagiQuest, the live action role-playing game for kids. But MagiQuest is a simple, straight-forward game. Videos in MagiQuest tell you what you need to do at each step, and you aren't given several things to do at once. You also aren't confused by quests that other players are being sent on between your turns. Both the rules and the game itself are clearly designed for kids as young as five. Here, however, the rules can confuse adults, while the game itself is so cute that it seems to have been designed for small children.It took us longer to understand the rules than it took us to play our first game. No one wanted to play it a second time. This is another game that will probably never again be taken out of the games' closet.If you're looking for a good game the entire family can play, I recommendThe Settlers of CatanorForbidden Island. The first isn't as sturdy as this game, but you'll never find another game with greater replay value the entire family from eight and up can enjoy; and Forbidden Island is an exciting cooperation that changes every time you play it.", "My 9 year old daughter LOVES this game, as does my 5 year old son.The directions are a little complex for kids to completely figure out themselves so I would recommend adult help the first game.That is about all my hubby and I wanted to play though unfortunately.WE are a big game family but this is one we will leave for the kids.", "\"I obtained this game for my seven-year-old daughter.  As soon as I opened the box, she was into the pieces.  The game board, pieces, and talking \"\"book\"\" are obviously very attractive to a seven-year-old.Setting up the game is easy.  However, some of the rules are not explained well.  For example, the first time we played, it was too easy because we placed the maze pieces purposefully to make it easy to move around the board.  Once we played, it was obvious that we should not have done that, but the rules did not make it clear that we should place the pieces randomly without regard to ease of moving around.Other than a few misunderstandings with the rules the first time we played, the game is relatively easy to learn and to play.  My daughter enjoyed playing it.  All of the pieces are colorful and enjoyable to view--there are gems, people, characters such as unicorns and princesses, and a bunch of nifty \"\"objects\"\" one has to collect in order to obtain gems.  All the cardboard pieces are pretty heavy and appear like they will last a long time.  There is a plastic thingy inside with compartments for all the pieces so everything can be kept neat and in order.  This is not a cheaply made game--everything in it is of a good quality.  I would say the game is worth the price.The only thing that is of concern to me is the talking book.  If that ever quits working, the game, no matter how good the quality is, is pretty much done for.  But because the rest of the game is of good quality, I would guess the book is well built also and should last a long time.  However, I guess it really would be easy enough to make rules to replace the talking book if need be.  The talking book is something that grabs the attention of the kids and makes the game more fun for them, but there is another game like this without a talking book, so those rules could be adapted, I suppose.  But none of that really matters if the book keeps working, so I'll move on with this review.The game moves along quickly and doesn't last so long that it gets tiring.  Changing the maze around is fun for the kids and makes them think a little, and the ability to get somewhere to do something on nearly ever turn makes it exciting for them.I have had other board games from this manufacturer and they have not fallen apart in any way.  One of my children's favorite games is \"\"Enchanted Forest\"\" from Ravensburger.  This is another quality game I would recommend from this manufacturer.  It is a simple, but fun, game that even my 13-year-old daughter still enjoys playing.Anyway, my child enjoyed playing this game; it is a well-made game with quality pieces; it is colorful and appealing to look at; and it is fun for me to play with the kids.  The box is comes in is well done also so all the pieces can be kept in order.  I can't ask for more than that, so I give it a five star rating.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.05804099142551422, 0.045872971415519714, 0.050563745200634, 0.03658106550574303, 0.039001382887363434, 0.04475958272814751, 0.04907037690281868, 0.048095256090164185, 0.044221069663763046, 0.04073236137628555, 0.03717347979545593, 0.03341713175177574, 0.04637037217617035, 0.041891343891620636, 0.05479930713772774, 0.04931419715285301, 0.04969270899891853, 0.04752960056066513, 0.0502205565571785, 0.03357016295194626, 0.049192968755960464, 0.049889419227838516]]}
