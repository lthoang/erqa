People always over exaggerate.  Works great at a reduced cost and you have a spare backup.", "I like the external charger, and the batteries work perfect in my HD Hero2.  I use my gopro for scuba diving, and it's extremely handy to have extra batteries so I can switch between dives.", "Pretty straight forward, does what it needs to.  High quality.  Would recommend this to any GoPro owner.  Doesn't take too long to charge and is a life saver when shooting for long periods of time.  2 batteries and a charger for 21 dollars... can't beat that!", "After one of my original batteries died I went into BestBuy to pick up another and all they sold were the Hero 3 accessories (only a few months after purchasing).  These fit great, work well and were way less expensive with a wall charger!", "This is a lot easier than charging batteries via a usb cable in the go pro hero. Highly recommended if you have more than one battery.", "I got this since the GoPro out of the box relies on charging the battery while installed in a camera via a USB cable. Great for off use times but not good when you are actually using the camera. The batteries fit in the charger fine and charged quickly and it is nice that it comes with both AC and a DC auto-cigarette lighter connection which really keeps you covered. Have not tested the discharge cycle while filming with the batteries but I have used Wasabi batteries in my Canon 5D mkII with great results.", "Great batteries and well made.  Holds a charge for a long time and you get two batteries, a charger all for the price of one OEM Gopro battery.  Won't disappoint and i really trust Wasabi with all my battery needs.", "These are a good product, they are good for holding a decent charge, but they do not last the normal like the regular gopro battery's.", "This is a great alternative to the go pro brand battery.Price: Compared to go pro battery this is a steal! You receive 2 batteries and a separate changer which you can use to charge all of you batteries even the go pro brand.Quality: This is the reason it is getting 4 out of 5 stars. It is advertised to have MORE battery than original go pros battery. While I can say they are good and last a long time they do not last longer than the original go pro's battery. For me they have always lasted the same amount of time as the go pro brand battery.The (basically free) charger: Works like a charm. I use it to charge all my go pro batteries not just the aftermarket Wasabi brand.", "i use these as backups to the original gopro battery and so far i find they last just as long as the original. plus they are easier to remove from the gopro, the original gopro battery is a pain to remove. these do the job.", "This is perfect for anyone who has a GoPro.  It works great and you can quick charge from home or the car.  The battery quality seems to be the same as the stock GoPro battery.  I would recommend this to anyone who has a GoPro.", "Great addition piece to have. It works well and having the extra charger is a good idea. Recommend this company and all of their products.", "I bought this charger with batteries about 5 months ago.  One day I charged all four batteries for a ski trip, but ended up not using it as I used my contour roam instead.  Three weeks later I tried charging the battery via the GoPRO's usb port for another ski trip, but the damn battery would _NOT_ charge! After fussing with it for a while I realize it's not charging because the battery is still charged! I would have assumed the battery would have lost it charged in three weeks and I would have to top it off.These batteries are great and they hold their charge well.  I even use my go pro as a car cam and with these batteries I can record over 2 hours ( I recorded close to 2.5 hrs).  I haven't ran the batteries down yet so I'm not sure how long I can record, but I'm a happy camper with these Wasabi batteries and charger.The batteries are slightly (very slight) bigger than the original so if you try to pull them from the long end, it's snug.  If you pop the battery out from the short end that is not the connector end it comes out with no problems.The charger looks like a good quality charger and built well.  I had no issues charging the batteries with the charger.  I haven't used the car adapter yet so I have no opinion of it other than it looks good :).Gary", "I did not detect superiority in the batteries (longer life or quicker charging) but the rig works fine. Recommended. And you really do need plenty of spare batteries for the weekend!!!Good value for the money.", "I bought this for my GoPro HD Hero 2 camera because two batteries and a AC/DC charger cost just a couple dollars more than one GoPro branded battery by itself. Not only do you get two Wasabi batteries, but their capacity is higher than the battery GoPro sells separately. Also, the charger can be used at home and on the road thanks to the included AC wall cord and 12v cigarette lighter adaptor. The batteries last a long time, and I've bought another Wasabi battery/charger set for my newer GoPro HD Hero 3.", "This is a must have for anyone with a Hero2.  You can have a pocketful of charged batteries and not have to use the battery backpac.  I use these when Mountain Biking and Snowboarding and they are not effected greatly by temperature.", "The kit comes with the following Items:- An AC Wall Charger (the prongs fold in to reduce the amount of space needed your carry bag)- Two 3.7V, 1400mAh (the OEM battery is only 1100mAh so these have a higher capacity, which equals a longer run time)- A car charger so you can charge your batteries on the go. I have a car charger on my motorcycle so I can swap out batteries and never miss a moment while riding.- An international outlet adapter for those of you who travel abroad.The price for this kit is much cheaper than what you will pay directly through GoPro and actually gets you a higher capacity battery. Some people have complained that these batteries are loose when installed in the camera and also the charger; I can tell you have not had that problem with my kit. The batteries charge in about 3 hours and work great.  I can't tell you how many times I missed some good shots in years past with the old GoPro due to not having enough batteries on hand.", "I read the review and purchased this in anticipation for my upcoming trip.  I used it to charge these batteries and the one that came with my GoPro Hero 2.  Once all the batteries were charged up I used these batteries and took them out on a test drive with my camera.  I had no issues with the fit and the charge held just fine.", "If you use a Go Pro you know how it eats batteries over the course of a long day of activities. These Wasabi batteries are just the ticket to keep you going. Just don't forget the extra SD cards too.", "for less than 1/2 the price of OEM you get a tad bit longer battery life. I use both of these at the same time with the backpack and consistently get an extra 15 or so mins extra recording time out of them. the one downside though is that they do not hold a full charge as long as OEM. this may or may not matter depending on how you use them but for instance if you charge them up and just leave them in your bag for a week or so they will loose a little of their charge. my OEM set can sit for weeks at a time and are still topped off when i go to use them. like i said it may matter to you or it may not. another difference, although this has never cause any issue is that these are a hair shorter than OEM. it actually helps sometimes because it makes it easier to get them out of the camera. taking the OEM batteries out i often have to use a small screwdriver or my teeth. Also you get an extra charger in the deal. Although I haven't actually ever used it.", "Works great, fits the same, 1/2 the price (or less) then the brand name stuff. Can't complain. I can throw a couple of extra batteries in my bag and record all day. Car/wall charger is a nice thing to have too while you are on the road.", "I have a bias against third party batteries. But these Wasabi batteries are much better than the Hero2 battery that came with the camera. It charges faster and lasts much longer. It even came with a charger which Hero2 is too cheap to provide. I love the design of Hero2, but I hate the company that makes Hero2. You have to buy so many accessories just to use the camera for any useful purposes.", "Needed another battery for my GoPro. Instead I get two batteries and a wall charger. Can't beat that. Any time you buy something that uses a rechargeable battery, it is always better to have a spare. You never know when you will need the extra power. This fit the purpose and at a great price.", "If you're looking for a spare GoPro battery (Which you really do need) then I'd defititely recommend this. It is so convenient having a wall / car charger instead of having to plug the camera into your PC to charge using the USB. The batteries are great also, still not sure if they have the same run time as the original GoPro battery but I haven't really tested it under a like for like situation.Baically if you have a GoPro - get this too.", "I had to wrap the batteries in tape to prevent them from rattling.  They last a little bit less than the stock battery.  I get about 1.5 hours run time with my hero2", "Yes, these are 3rd party adapters but they are cheap and work exceptionally well.  I actually change them out with the stock one that came with the GoPro and I don't even notice a difference.  The charger is also awesome and wayyyyy better than charging through the GoPro and USB.  This is literally the first thing I tell people to buy as soon as they get a GoPro.  The batteries don't last very long as it is, you're going to need backups and the Wasabi Power Kit is the best way to go for the buck.", "After many cycles of use I can say that these really work and gave me much more flexibility when using my camera. I had to be turning it on and off constantly to save battery, now I don't have to worry. Charger and battery work great and gets the job done.", "I just don't use them that often so I can't say a lot about them. The charger works great and they have more capacity then the OE battery. When I do use them, they work fine. It's nice knowing I have back up when I might need it. Frankly I'm mostly disappointed with the GoPro itself and their customer service so I just don't use the camera that much anymore.", "This is a great way to add extra battery power for my Go Pro Hero 2. These batteries last as long as the factory one and got 2 for a great price and an extra charger that comes with connection for car and wall.. Get it you will not be sorry! Remember the more batteries the longer you can record..", "Does exactly what aftermarket batteries and a matching charger should, namely they work right and saved money over OEM.Pros* Quick charge (under a couple hours, typically)* Fit is exact (no shifting due to too small, or can't fit due to too large)* No quality issues (rippling, leakage, damaged contacts)* Feels high-quality and well-built* Charger works fine* Charger uses 120V mains current plus has a 12V DC adapterCons* None observed.Other thoughtsUseful to have extras for this camera, so I was happy to order and receive these.", "The batteries hold a little more mAh, and can be charged while you use the other one. If you're smart you will use this you charge the gopro battery too, so you will have 3 batteries.If you're dumb, you will loose 2 batteries, like i did.", "You can't beat having extra battery power when you're out for a long day. The kit is a great value for the price."], "Gamma": [0.03491915017366409, 0.03491728752851486, 0.03491915017366409, 0.012475338764488697, 0.03491835296154022, 0.012335454113781452,
