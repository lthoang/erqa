From AvP on the Jaguar, all the way up to the horrible psx version of Alien Trilogy. All of them were fairly horrible with the exception of maybe the arcade beat-em-up edition of Aliens.With that said, I wasn't very excited about Aliens Colonial Marines. I knew it was going to be horrible, however, me being a huge Alien fan, I had to get it. All I can say is that I wasn't nearly as surprised as other folks. There are many things I liked about the game but I will say that what kept me from enjoying it would have been the fact that the game felt unpolished. Or a better description would be that it felt unfinished. I think with a bit of refinement this could have been really good. The game felt like it was done but all the developers had to do was put in a bit of refinement.The game is really hard to write in a good solid review. So with that said, I think I'll blurt out some random points about what I liked or didn't.Disliked:* The word \"\"Marines\"\" is excessively overused. Right from the get go, the word \"\"Marines\"\" is used literally in every sentence. And it isn't like a casual \"\"marines\"\" mentioning like a proud marine, but they emphasize it to go \"\"MA\"\", slight pause, \"\"RINES.\"\"* Clipping issues with the world. Some exciting parts of the game are ruined due to what I think are clipping issues. For example, one part I recall you're walking in and you're tracking these Aliens and suddenly, one goes underneath the ground and all you see running after you is a tail stuck out the ground. You can't kill it because it's underground, yet it can kill you.* Hitboxes appear \"\"off.\"\" Especially distance shots do not appear to work very well. Also, when someone is hiding, even if their heads are exposed, it doesn't appear to register the shot very well. There are times where you can unload an entire magazine of pulse rifle on something standing next to you and nothing will happen.* You level up to gain weapons. The game has a way to gain new weapons through leveling. It's very similar to perhaps Call of Duty. None of the upgrades are actually useful and all of the weapons appear rather horrible compared to the bread and butter M41A Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, and whatever handgun.* Explosion effects are not really that useful. Again this goes with the hitbox issue but it appears using the grenade is not very useful.* AI is horrible. The alien AI is horrible but also your teammate AI is horrible. Your teammate could literally be standing next to an enemy and nothing will happen. The aliens appear to only attack you and not your teammates. So your teammates could be rushing in or walking casually around the room and absolutely nothing will happen to him. You would think developers would have this right considering that all the Aliens did in the movie was continuously come after the main characters and you just blast them.* The graphics in the demo is vastly better than the graphics in this game. While it appears the gameworld is complete, the small effects like broken windows, smoke, etc do not appear in the final version. The demo however appeared to have much better effects. What I understand is that Gearbox hired many developers to finish the game and with that in mind, I think someplace the better version just didn't get complete and they just shipped it out with an older build of the game.* Story is horrendous. The game takes place after the events of the Alien trilogy so that means Ripley is dead, and the last of the alien species are dead. However, this game make no sense. At the start, we see the Sulaco is still at LV426. Hicks is somehow alive too. He sent a distress call and that's where the game takes place. At the start of the game, a main character indicate that the Sulaco was over Fury 161 yet the explanation of this is later revealed in the game and it's extremely poor. There are literally thousands of alien walking around yet no explanation on how they came about. LV426 blew up yet it remained in this game as well.* The quality of the cut scene is vastly different than in game graphics. What I mean is when I first seen a cutscene, it appears like characters had dirt and cuts on them. Then in game, everyone is clean and fine. The graphics appear to load rather late in that at first the world appears very muddy then suddenly somewhat good. Still very unpolished though.* Aliens don't explode or react like they do in the movie. The acid do no appear to do anything and when hit or struck, don't \"\"explode\"\" like they did in the movie.* The Tracker is absolutely horrible. The tracker is what I was most excited about in this game. As you recall, other aliens game had the tracker on the screen overlay but this one you get a separate tracking device that you can pull out like in the movies. However it fails miserably and I don't even know how they could get this wrong. It's more of an objective locator and finding hidden things like legendary weapons and name tags. Otherwise, what appears to happen is that while there are enemies, a tacker icon will appear on the screen. This means there are enemies and if you pull the tracker out you can get a location. Now with the tracker, there might be blips on the screen but again I think the main thing is that you have to trigger an event in order to see the enemy. For example, there are parts in the game where you pull the tracker out, see that there's a blip behind a door so you get ready, door opens, blip shows it right in front but the alien doesn't appear until you entered. Essentially the tracker is useless and it most certainly didn't felt like the movie where you got this tracker and you're trying to find out what's coming at you. It didn't felt scary at all. The tacker wasn't even graphically similar to that of the movie. In the movie, each blip was fuzzy ball. In this game, the blips appear as a sharp round object. It didn't felt like the movies at all.Likes:* The world is very well imitated to the Aliens film. I felt that the world was really well built but again it's about the small refinements that I don't think they ever got around to.* Guns and gun sounds are very well designed. Again they got it right down to the movie. I never tested out any other weapon as I stuck with the pulse rifle, shotgun, and pistol. I felt they were good enough just the way it is. However, being that you can customize it with things like a silencer, I felt it gotten a tad bit silly and again not well used.* You can find Legendary Weapons and Dog tags. The game really plays well into the nostalgic elements of the films. Dog tags are nametags that you can find that has the name of a person from the film and quotes. The quotes are sometimes good. Now the legendary weapons are really fun. You get various weapons that are used by characters in the film. From Vasquez pistol and smartgun to Hick's famous shotgun. Very fun to find. Sadly some of the weapons cannot be carried throughout the game like Vasquez smart gun or Drake's flame thrower. Other like Hick's rifle appear to use completely different ammunition from the normal weapons you find even though they might be the same type.* There is a Prometheus reference in the game. Well it's no big deal anyways, but near the end there's a neat reference for those who seen the movie and understand some times about the original Alien derelict ship.That's about all I can really think of. Again I felt that if they stamped out the bugs, and polished it up a bit, this game could have been really, really good. It had everything going for it: a good fan base, some exciting level designs, but it all fell short because they just didn't polish it up before releasing. Plus the demo version appeared to be REALLY good while the final build is horrible.Overall get this purely for nostalgic reasons. But otherwise don't expect a top of the line game that you can carry on for years and years.\"", "Let me start off by saying I'm such a huge Aliens fan.  I have one of the designs of the xenomorphs that Giger did tattooed as a sleeve on my arm, I love 'em.  This game was something that I've been anxiously awaiting the release of.  I woke up on release day to read how horrible this game was, the graphics, etc... but I still said that I'm an Aliens fan so I'll pick up my reserve of it and try to love it the best I can.  Yeah...easier said than done.  The graphics are beyond laughable.  There is this canister on the ground that from a distance looks cool all lit up, something ala Dead Space the stomp containers...but when you get close to it, the lights are so pixelated and blocky that it doesn't even look like a light, it's terrible.  Now apply that little detail to the rest of the game.  It looks horribly unfinished, the mouths don't even move the right way when the characters talk.  The dialogue is very stiff almost like people were held at gunpoint when reading their lines.  The action is either predictable or stupid.  There's no bullet detection when you shoot the aliens, they just got covered in their blood and fall over.  The only redeeming part of this game is that my game stop gave me a full refund on it.  Now, I don't hate it....but I wouldn't pay more than 20 dollars for this......WHICH is probably going to be sooner than later it will be that cheap.  So I urge people to of course, gather your own opinion on this, but as a hardcore gamer and huge Aliens fan, this missed the mark by a few lightyears.", "\"I have no idea how this game came into my life but while it has it's ocassional moments of glory, \"\"A:CM\"\" I swear, must have been a re-issue from some previous release.So apparantly the game came out in 2013, that is after the release of Assassin's Creed III, Battlefield 3, Ghost Recon: Future Soldier, and even Call of Duty: Black Ops II, all of which are to varying degrees fabulous games in their own ways. Yet judging by the look and feel of the entire game, I could've sworn that I must have accidentally gotten on a time machine and travelled back to 1998 or earlier and played this game on a PC because the graphics are extremely dated-looking, even by 1998 standards. The way the entire game, both single and multiplayer function is of a nature that I could've sworn would've looked like a prototype for an early Playstation 1-era console. I can't even begin to go into details of how big a missed opportunity \"\"Aliens: Colonial Marines\"\" has turned out to be.To me, my impression is that the game combines aspects of the Halo Series and the engine-interface aspects of Call of Duty, but completely strips away any of the things that made both franchises worth the countless hours, worth spending rainy days and nights, and earning achievements, playing with. \"\"Aliens: Colonial Marines\"\" combines Halo and Call of Duty but more of the scraps of both franchises, resutling in one of the most poorly-produced games I think I've come across in the last decade.Most games usually shine on their multiplayer servers rather than single player campaigns. Crysis, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and even Halo and Ghost Recon. However, that is not the case here with A:CM. The multiplayer suffers from horrendous lag and lacks any significant edge with the graphic interface showing the kind of quality I'd expect from an amateur prototype made on somebody's home computer. Not only that but there is very heavy bias towards the marine faction with limited ability to level up on the Xenomorph side. Mentioning that, controlling the xenomorphs is an unnecessarily difficult nightmare due to the changing camera angles when climbing on walls and ceiling, all of which completely throw up my playing. It ruins at least half of the multiplayer fun for me and made it nearly unplayable. On both the single and multiplayer portions of the game, I see entire graphic sceneries that look more like small to large colored pieces that attempt to become holes in walls, ceilings and floors, or blood stains but simply look like glitches in the graphics. Just the way everything about the game operates gives me two impressions.One-Somebody or some past crew were working on producing  this game probably as early in 1996, but then stopped further production in early 1998, and then put it away in a vault and was forgotten for the next 14 years and then somebody, in a foolish decision, decided \"\"Oh let's release it now!\"\" and released it in it's half-assed state.Or two, the makers put almost no effort into the quality or playability of the game rendering it perhaps the most poorly made product I've ever come across in the video game realm. The ultimate result is something that is easily showned to have been rushed right out the door with zero input into the background, the graphics, the sound effects, and the aliesn themselves looked like mere cartoon-puppet props, rather than the feared alien antagonists they were/are in the movie series.Either way, it's hard to believe that in 2013, considering the price listed, that A:CM could have turned out to be so haphazardly done but it really is. It's far from terrible but considering the hype I've read and heard about it, this is perhaps the weakest game I've come across and the biggest letdown of a video game since \"\"Twisted Metal 3\"\" from 15 years earlier.Don't bother wasting your time with this mini-lemon of a game. If you want to play, fine. Rent it or borrow it from a friend or family member. Even \"\"Medal of Honor: Warfighter\"\" and \"\"Homefront\"\", for all their issues, were better than this.\"", "After such a long delay I had such high expectations for this game.  I think a lot of people did and I think that's a contributing factor to the poor reviews it's received.  I mean, when you're clamoring for a game to be released for more than two years and it's finally released, it's easy to have a feeling of major disappointment when it simply doesn't deliver.  That being said, ACM is not the absolute worst game in the world as many of the reviews would have you to believe.  It's an average FPS with an average story with well...maybe below average graphics.  Alien fans can look it from different perspectives: If you're looking for the intense story line that included plenty of scares and feelings of desperation, then you probably won't find it here.  However, if you're a FPS junkie that likes the idea of a FPS based on the Alien franchise, you might derive some enjoyment from this game.  I mean, it does stay true to the franchise by using authentic sounds (the pulse rifle, tracker and alien screams are spot on.  Not to mention voice acting from the actual stars of the movies).  But it really ends there.  The game is mostly a linear FPS that has you facing Weylan Industries troopers and droves and DROVES of various types of xenomorphs.  That's pretty much it.  I almost felt like I was playing the marine stages of AVP...they are pretty similar.  If you're a huge Alien or FPS fan, I recommend that you wait until this title is around the $20-$30 price point before you buy...renting it would be even better.PROS- Authentic Alien sounds- An OK FPS- Decent FPS controlsCONS- Poor graphics- Bad story line- Not a very good representation of the Alien movie franchise- Can get repetitiveOverall: 5/10", "\"I won't waste time retreading the same ground everyone else and point out one simple fact, it's made by Gearbox.Gearbox is and always has been a mediocre game developer. Their big claim to fame is borderlands which is essentially if you put world of warcrafts boring quest system into a wasteland, put it in first person mode, then tout how it has millions of guns but the fact is 1 out of 10,000 are actually an upgrade (repainting the same crummy pistol 5,000 times doesn't make 5,000 different guns) and finally start pimping DLC for the game before it even releases and then keep releasing more to nickel and dime your customers to death by turning a 60 dollar turd into a 100 dollar turd. They also made duke nukem forever which as we all know is a giant steaming pile of you know what and is a god awful abortion from start to finish. The best games they actually made were the brothers in arms games which aren't as terrible as those other two games but its still incredibly sterile, generic and uninspired. BIA is your basic mediocre WW2 shooter and nothing else. They have a few other games under their belt but they are all titles no one really cares about and faded into obscurity as soon as they were released. Bottom line is Gearbox is a terrible game maker and this is a terrible game.Now for a quickie about colonial marines.The story is nothing short of fan fiction written by someone who cannot write but still posts to their blog and believes themselves to be a great writer. It's kind of like how a young girl will take pictures of furniture sitting in a shadow in black and white and then think they are really deep and brooding for taking such artistic photographs when in fact it's just garbage. They tried to wink at the fans so hard their eyes have fallen out because of it. Everything about it feels very amateur, boring and forced. It feels more like they did a sci-fi channel original aliens movie, or something that went direct to video.The game is buggy as you can get. I've flown out the side of things and floated high in the air stuck. I've had allies that would stick in walls. Hell I found out in section you were supposed to be stealthy starting out and I just ran past every alien and once I passed them they forgot about me and I finished a level without firing a shot. I see environmental objects get stuck in things and so on.All the pretty and cool looking screenshots and videos I've been seeing for over a year from now weren't from the same game they released. You can easily find comparison videos showing the game released looks just awful compared to the \"\"in game footage\"\" they showed in the past.Multiplayer is very sterile and pretty much what you'd expect. It's so boring in fact that multiplayer will be a ghost town in 2 months.The game play its pretty much call of duty. It's just a mix of \"\"it's the last stand....again\"\" and \"\"quick run through fast as you can\"\" with some boring corridor stalking in between.I could go into great depth, I could go on and on naming other things I didn't like but you can read other Amazon reviews and see exactly what I've got to say.So really if you must play this, wait till its 10 dollars. Trust me it won't take very long before it gets there. And next time, don't pay full price for a Gearbox title.\"", "\"I had never thought I would see a game that was more grossly disappointing then \"\"Duke Nuke'em Forever\"\". Well one came out. And it had to be an even more iconic franchise, indeed it was the franchise that cemented the idea of what military science fiction should look and sound like. More horrible is the thought that \"\"Aliens\"\" is thee biggest influance of pass and current titles from other movies to book and video games; Doom, Halo, StarCraft even Dead Space all take inspiration from that second film.Waking up on release day I first checked IGN to see what they had to say about Aliens: Colonial Marines. A rating of 4. Bad.  That was their official review.But never the less IGN is known to have impossible high standards and most people seem to disagree with; plus one should never speak ill of any product without testing it yourself.Oh Dear god IGN was Right. It's a horrible game.  This is why there is Gamefly.Despite touting special sound effects from the movies, James Horner's music and voice talent by both Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen this game STILL fell several miles short. The graphics would be good if this was an Original Xbox game, there are next to no particle effects and the sound is muted. The music isn't as loud as it should be and seriously lacks that driving percussion that fallowed the latter half of the second Alien film, there is no satisfying \"\"thud\"\" as bullets smack into things or a meaty crunch as exoskeletons break apart like Dungeness crab legs, absolutely everything is half assed here, so much that the 2010 version of Aliens Vs Predator is massively superior game.The plot is this, you rescue Hicks. That's really it in a nut shell, turns out Hicks wasn't in his cryo-chamber when the other ones where jettison because Wayland Yutani PMC had boarded the ship and took him hostage. You go find him, disrupt Wayland operations, kill a lot of Xenos and PMCs, that's it.\"", "Is this the worst game I ever played? NoIs this worth 60 bucks?  No.  Probably more like 20 or 30 dollars.Will FPS non Alien fans like this game?  Doubt it.Will die hard Alien fans eat this up?

This game totally feels like it languished in development hell for 6 years and was done by multiple developers.  A missed opportunity.  Only check this out if you are nuts about Aliens, otherwise stay away.  I would have given this game a solid 1 star if not for the surprisingly fun co-op mode and the cool but confusing storyline for those of us who yearned for more after the Aliens film.", "do your self a favor. don't buy this game. read all the reviews, then you'll understand. I have nothing more to say to this game. this lie...buy a nice meal for a homeless person instead.", "It sucks plain and simple.  Save your money and go buy X-COM.  Or flush it down the toilet which would be more satisfying than this turd of a game.", "First of all, I am a fan of the Alien franchise which is a big part of the reason I had been looking forward to this game's release for a few years.  I was caught up in a few great games (Dead Space 3 and others) so I didn't end up pre-ordering this game (boy did I luck out).  I did head to the internet though right after Colonial Marines was released as I was curious what everyone was thinking.  The reviews were almost laughably bad.  I was thinking that maybe people were judging it a little harsh because of their disappointment and that maybe, just maybe, it wasn't quite that bad.  I did see a few people give it higher (mediocre) reviews.  Well, I had an Amazon gift card and was done playing the other games and the price had already dipped down to about half of what it was when it was first released.  Like everyone said, the graphics are dated, the gameplay stinks, the atmosphere is barely there, the AI sucks, and the difficulty is all over the place.  I did read though that they had made it more difficult (maybe too much so) in order to try and make up for the shoddy AI.  Well, that didn't work.  Stay away from this game, there are so many better games out there!", "Some people are solely judging this game and giving it low ratings because of the lies they were told. The truth is, this game does not suck! Is it great? No, but it does not suck. If you can get past the lies that Randy Pitchford and Gearbox told and sold you, this game is actually entertaining. The A.I. leaves a lot to be desired though. Often the A.I. will let aliens run right past them and other times they just can't seem to kill an alien that is right in their face. The enemy soldiers all seem to be marksmen and can sometimes shoot through metal walls and crates and even around corners. You can die very fast in this game as the shield and health drain quickly when you are hit. The aliens don't just stand in front of you waiting to be shot like another post claimed. They will run on ceilings, on walls and right up in your face. The game is also lengthy if you take the time to look around. Those that complete games quickly are the ones that are trying to break the Guiness Book of World Records time for fastest game completion. Never listen to people who tell you a game is too short. That is because they just ran through it. One post said that after patches, the game looks almost exactly like it did in the demos. This is not true. The game is not bad looking but lets get real. The game is not what we were promised graphically and some things were omitted. Randy and Gearbox should be flogged and sued for their lies and deception. With that said, the game is worth a purchase at a lower price. It is not worth sixty dollars simply because it is not the graphical spectacle we were promised and, they lied!", "its not what i was hopeing the game to be. but its ok takes time to get going good you can die in the game fast.i was wanting it to be a bad ass horror game.. that it aint so if you want it to be like the movies keep hopeing ti.... and if you play it you may see what im saying about this game if i had know about it. i may have not got it..... im 98% sure of it", "I recently purchased this game and you know what ? Its alot of fun. I noticed that when I started the game I recieved an xbox update before it would allow me to play the game. This had to be a patch of some kind because I have not had any of the issues people keep complaining about.I am playing this game with my console connected to a 42 inch LED samsung TV with an HDMI cable. The graphics are not the best Ive seen but they are still very good. The only thing I think they should have worked on a little more is the characters faces. They dont look quite as good as everything else but it is passable.The sounds in this game are awesome , from the aliens hissing , doors opening , pulse rifle , and even the hand held motion detector Everything sounds authentic.This game picks up right after the events of the Aliens 2 film. I have seen many complains about actually having to fight humans and aliens in this game. Many just wanted to be fighting the aliens only, but so what. If you have seen the movies you would know that the whole mission of aliens 2 was started by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation. Now since things in the movie didnt go as planned for the corporation , dont you think they would be sending their own people to recover what they want ? The answer to that question is a resounding yes. So the human enemies in this game make complete sense.All I want to do here is let everyone know that this is a really good game. Maybe it was a patch that fixed all of the glitches and issues that has caused all of the complaints because I have had none. Some of the complaints are very unfounded and a prime example of that are the complaints about fighting humans. If you are a fan of the movie series I really dont see whats not to like. Solid 4 out of 5.Edit :Since I played this game it made me want to try the AVP game and I must say that AVP is and awesome aliens game. If you like this game and havnt tried AVP you need to give it a try. It is a darker game than this and playing as a Colonial Marine in that game is fantastic. You will constantly be very looking side to side and behind you because in AVP the Aliens will come from everywhere and at times without notice. I had a very nervous and foreboding feeling the whole time I was playing the Marine portion of the game. I picked AVP up from here on Amazon in like new condition for $17.00 and it has been worth every penny. Also The graphics are a little better in AVP , Mostly the detail to things and environment Mostly. Enjoy", "While I'll give the creators of the game kudos for half trying to give gamers a realistic style of being in the movie it hardly felt like it as more you were just trying to finish the game and see if there was anything that would makeup for the lackluster gameplay.The A.I. for alien and human enemies as well as allies was almost beyond pathetic during some fight levels,case in point you're fighting two enemy marines and with them being less then ten feet apart from each other you can flame throw one and the other apparently doesn't notice what's happening to his partner Really!!?!Your teammate's A.I. intuition is hardly any better as they are more a hindrance then help and you're left wondering if you can just leave their sorry butts behind.  the saddest A.I. is the aliens where you can pretty much just pick them off with easy shots in most levels when you keep your distance as they seem to lose sight of you when you put more then ten feet distance between the two of you.I'm trying  not to be too harsh with the game thus the three star rating but truthfully it falls below even the one star rating for gamers though for fans you might still get a kick out of it as it does bring some levels from the second movie to move around.If you can get the game for $15 or less then go for it as it's a time passing FPS just keep any real expectations of the game to a very low minimum.", "You can finish it in around 5-6 hours on normal. The game plays literally like call of duty with the weapon load out of goldeneye. This game was in development for something like 6 years and it shows since it seems stuck in an era gone by, much like duke and brink. The AI is mind numbing and it relies far too heavily on nostalgia from the movies to carry it. If you want a fantastic fps go buy borderlands 2, the only good game Gearbox is currently putting any effort into. If you absolutely have to play this, wait for 3-4 weeks when it drops to about 15 bucks.", "Aliens: Colonial Marines is cool in concept but very run of the mill in execution. While the game certainly lives up to capturing the look and feel of the movie with the enviroments, gun sounds and music, it still plays like an ordinary FPS.Graphics: I'm not one to complain much about graphics since I consider them of only second or third rate importance compared to gameplay, but oh man! The graphics in this game are so dated they're almost embarassing to look at. Textures will constantly pop in and out and even when they are all the way in they don't look very detailed. A while ago I was having fun with Doom 3: BFG edition; I'm not sure if it's because that game is still fresh in my memory but I can't help but think this game's graphics look very much the same....worse, actually. Very poor, laughable graphics all around.Gameplay: Feels a little too much like CoD for my taste. The game comes with the now obligatory XP level up system for unlocking stuff in multi-player (which might be this games only saving grace). It really makes me feel less a part of the Aliens experience when a bar on the top tells me when I've ranked up. There's nothing innovative in the way the game controls, its mostly been ripped from other FPSers. Worst of all, I feel somewhat overpowered when fighting off Xenomorphs and human mercanaries. Yeah, I've died plenty of times but I'm suprised to see how high my kill count is at the end of a level, usually in the sixties. Xenomorphs will run mindlessly around every which way when you're fighting them and occasionally you'll even see a computer controlled fellow marine and an alien run into and clip right through each other. Your comrades aren't very smart either and will sometimes get hung up on a wall or run in the wrong direction. Your comrades also seem to be invincilbe. Not once did I ever worry about them or feel I needed to help, unless the game told me to. The only remotely cool thing is wrestling off a xenomorph when it grabs me and shooting it with my pistol...but even that feels a little silly. Aren't these thing supposed to be strong enough to bust through a steel door?Level design is a least pretty good. The game has many branching corridors that you can sometimes get lost in. Kind of annoying but It would be even more annoying if the game constantly had arrows pointing your way and thus taking out all thought process. One level of particular note is one in which you're unarmed, helpless, and have to sneak your way through a level of blind, motion traking aliens withouth them noticing. This level had me genuinely scared, but I regret that some of the scare factor was taken away when I saw that these aliens kill you by suicide bombing. Obvious Left 4 Dead elements shamelessly ripped. This bit of survival horror is a nice touch but only a small bit of novelty in an unremarkable game.Story: Not much story. You're a Marine sent along with several other Marines to investigate the remains of the Sulaco and later LV-426. Throughout, you'll have to fight off waves of xenomorphs and human mercanaries dispatched by the evil Wayland Yutoni Corp. who are, as ever, hell bent on capturing the xenomorphs to use as biological weapons. This is the plot of all the Alien movies thus far and its getting more than a little old.In all, I'm sorry I went to a midnight opening and bought this game full price. The only thing I can do is try and get as much enjoyment out of it as I can but even then I'll probably still be sorry.", "This game just screams &#34;rushed.&#34;  The ideas and gameplay talked/shown at press conferences never made it into the game although they did look amazing.  That right there tells me that the ideas were there but whether through time constraints or budget constraints it just never made it into the game.  It's not often I'll rate a product so low but this is a rare exception.  The game is bad and the nostalgia factor only allows you to look past a couple problems.  When the problems start taking away from your love of the movies and comics then you know something is just wrong.  The sad fact is that most people will look at this game and see &#34;Gearbox&#34; on the cover and immediately think it's good because of their work with Borderlands.  Please don't be one of those people.  This is a bad game that should be avoided.", "I just got done with this game at 1:01 a.m on Feb.13 I honestly have to say there was great potential for this game as an A L I E N fan I am extreamly dissapointed with GearBox, it felt as if they just sat around and didnt give a rats ass about us A L I E N fans and just wanted our money then laugh at us like this whole thing was a big sick joke, there was only two extremly suspensful scenes where your running away from a new breed of Xenomorph called Raven sealing off doors trying to figure out what way to go then you start to panic then go into the air vents then after a short while there was another scene where you are walking through the sewers lights are flashing and the only thing you see is a deformed alien walking towards you when you make a sound also this game has a couple of places that is most recongnizable from the ALIENS movie like the scene where newt and riply fought off the facehugger to the most famous scene off of the alien franchis the space jockey. This game  has the worst looking graphics known to date the lighting looks bland and the textures are very dull aswell as the humans they did'nt even look realistic even the animation was really bad now the voice acting was good so as the Alien enviroments to the aliens themselve's but the animation was just disgusting. Six years Gearbox spent on this game and this is what ever happen to the sick demo that they showed at E3 were everything look straight up creepy enviroments to the most awesome fighting scenes with face to face with the xenomorphs and aswell very entertaining cinematics which they also fail to accomplished if you compared the demo to the actual game you will be mad as hell  I DEMAND A REMAKE OF THIS GAME oOR A IMPROVE ADD ON TO THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!. If I were you keep your money and spend it on games that are worth the $60 like Bioshock Infinite, Crysis 3, Tomb Raider, and Grand Theft Auto", "\"Listen to reviewers and the sites like IGN, Gamespot etc. This game is just plain out bad. For one the visuals are quite out dated, this game was being developed back when they were still making PS2 games, and was suppose to be released for it but was cancelled. You can clearly see why. It's almost as if the game has been sitting somewhere for the last 5 years and they just now said ok, lets release it. The voice acting is very bad, and they try to hard to emulate Bill Paxton, and Michael Beihn, and overall the dialogue is well, just very corny. The controls are a mess, like a lot of SEGA games, and doesn't play nearly as well as games like Condemned 1 and 2. The atmosphere is pretty good, but overall the scares are minimal and the aliens just seem to go through the motions and not be very smart. Late last night i rented this from the Red Box, i was pretty shocked to see it in there, but then again this game was never really hyped that much, because i think people knew it would be a bad game. Aiming is also a mess and there is more recoil than any of the MW or Battlefield games, not accurate at all. And even on easy the game is very tough. At first years ago after hearing about the game i welcomed it, because i loved the second Aliens film. Well if you want more thrills just go back and watch the movie. Which this game attempts to mimic, but not very well at all. That's all i have to say about it. You'll find out after playing for just a few short hours. If you have a gaming rig, you may be able to get more \"\"impressive\"\" visuals, but that won't save this from being an average shooter that wants to be good.\"", "You would think that such a beloved franchise would receive the care and attention to detail that games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, X-Com, etc. get.  At least!  But this is an utter failure and disgrace.  The a.i. is stupid.  The gameplay is monotonous and boring.  The aliens are not challenging.  They are not encountered in horrifying, interesting, or thrilling ways.  The entire game feels like it escaped a 1980's arcade and someone is trying to steal our money with it in 2013.If you want to battle aliens and have a lot of fun, buy X-Com or Dead Space.  This is just another spit in the face of all of us Aliens and Predator fans.  When has anyone done a good job making a game out of those franchises?  It boggles the mind.  The world LOVES Aliens.  The idea of being immersed in that world is exciting.  They could have taken the time to produce a spectacular, detailed, story-heavy continuation of the franchise: a feast of our dearest monsters and marines.  Instead we get an undercooked floppy piece of greasy meatloaf with a dead fly on top.I am sick of waiting for a great game about Aliens.  I declare the franchise dead within the gaming world.
