"], "reviews": ["\"\"\"What does purified water with natural caffeine taste like?\"\" asks the bottle,\"\"Like nothing.\"\" I must admit that I completely agree (though I'm unsure what exactly makes this caffeine \"\"natural\"\"). Basically, this avitae caffeinated water tastes like a typical bottle of purified water. 0 Calories, 0g fat, 0g sodium, etc - exactly what you'd expect, except it also contains 90mg caffeine (around the same amount that's in a cup of coffee).If you don't like coffee or other caffeinated drinks (and if you don't like taking caffeine pills), then this product is right for you. Caffeinated water is definitely a good alternative to those products.\"", "Water that tastes like... water but has a little bit of caffeine added? Nothing wrong with that only it's way too expensive in my view and it's a giant waste of disposable bottles. For a little bit of caffeine I prefer white tea and it's easy to make some and take it in reusable bottles. It tastes great, hot or chilled, sweet or plain but that's just my preference.I will rate this one as a 2-star because I personally don't like it for being too expensive and wastefully packaged. It's not a 1-star because the product is presented for what it is so it's everyone's decision whether to buy it or not.", "\"It's purified water.  It tastes like water.  It has a jolt of caffeine -- almost as much as a cup of coffee -- which is flavorless.  It comes in a plastic bottle with a semi-mirrored appearance and a screw cap.  In other words, this is like bottled water and a half tablet of NoDoz or some other alertness product.  I drank a whole bottle (16.9 fluid ounces).  I felt the caffeine.  It didn't leave me with an upset stomach or jittery or anything.But it's expensive considering what it is.  Unless you're really in it for some kind of status or prestige (as the company's marketing of the \"\"bottle that gets noticed\"\" suggests you are), you might just as well drink regular water and pop half a NoDoz.  I'd give it five stars if it were less expensive.\"", "When the bottle arrived I placed it in the fridge. I wanted to try it when it was nice and cold. After working on a project in the kitchen really late at night, I was tempted to grab a cold coffee from the fridge but saw the `caffeine' water and decided that seemed more appealing.I read some reviews where they thought it tasted bad or could not finish it. I know we all have our personal taste on items but I must say I was rather surprised by how good this water was. I think if you do not drink water on a daily basis you might not like this. You might even think it will have a certain taste or flavor but it does not. It tastes like water. As far as the caffeine, I felt it but could not say if I felt it was equal to a same amount of caffeine if a cup of coffee as the bottle claimed. I did feel the caffeine though.I drink a lot of Smart Water during the day, the liter size bottles and they cost me about a dollar. Being this is rather small and does not have the electrolytes but only caffeine; I think the price is a bit high. That is just my opinion.I was very impressed with the taste though. Refreshing is what I would say and that is straight from the bottle. If you like your caffeine and also water, you can't go wrong here. I love both so it was perfect for me!", "Avitae 90 Mg Caffeinated Water, tastes exactly like purified water and you don`t taste any other additives. The caffeine is a plus for me because I recently started a diet and began having horrible headaches only to find out I was having caffeine withdrawals from all the sodas I was drinking, but this caffeinated water helps you get over those caffeine headaches without any extra calories. The water is smooth and refreshing. Great water for people that need that extra jolt without having to consume coffee, tea, energy drinks,or sodas.", "What I like about this water besides its flavor is the ability to control the amount of caffeine you want to have.  The entire bottle is 90mg of caffeine, so it's up to you to decide what amount is right for you.  Refreshing and an unexpected source of caffeine!", "Looks like water, tastes like water, didn't see any real benefit from this. I don't think this is going to sell very well.", "\"If you are looking for a source of caffeine that has no added ingredients, this one will fill the bill. It tastes ... Just like water. A bit pricy in my book, but it is what it claims it is.But my key question was, what does it mean that it has natural caffeine? And is there a difference?In one sense, the two are structurally identical. However, since synthetic caffeine is purer, it is absorbed faster and gives a faster \"\"jolt.\"\" but it also, in the pure form allows a faster letdown.Normally, you get natural caffeine when drinking coffee or tea, or consume many other forms of caffeinated products, including my personal favorite, chocolate.So where does the natural caffeine in water come from? Actually, according to their web site, it comes mainly from coffee beans. Companies that sell decafeinated coffee or tea have to process it to remove the caffeine. The caffeine that is extracted is sold to companies who want to add caffeine to their products. This includes soda companies who gain a majority of their caffeine from this process.So the caffeine you are drinking here is taken out of the same beans you use to make your morning coffee. If you would like to skip the middleman, and enjoy the taste of coffee, you can just brew a fresh cup, even have an iced cup.I have given this five stars because it is exactly what it says it is, and because it tasted exactly like water to me.  It also comes in a recyclable bottle with no BPA. Would I buy it? Probably not at the current price point. I'll stick with other sources of caffeine that come in a washable mug, no recycling needed. :-)\"", "\"If you want a pick-me-up & need some caffeine, then this might just be fore you!Taste very much like bottled water... A little taste of something that's barely noticeable, but is there (I'm very sensitive to tastes & smells, so most people likely wouldn't taste anything... more or less other than that, tasteless water, as water should be!Nice to have some type of caffeine that doesn't have added acids, like coffee - especially for sensitive stomachs.If I couldn't taste a hint of chemical in the water, I'd have given it a 5-star, yet it could be from the bottle too, as it is packaged in plastic.I'd love to see a company go back to the days when we had glass containers & didn't have any hint of plastic in our food, when fruits & vegetables weren't in plastics, but in wood, often local to the area where the fruits & veggies grew, so yeah, I have a VERY high standard for paying for a bottle of water!Great if you don't tolerate coffee or tea well & want some caffeine though! Can be helpful for some allergies or headaches for some people too! ;) Enjoy! A nice thing to have around the house as \"\"medicine\"\", but I wouldn't drink it every day.\"", "The Avitae water gave me a good lift comparable to a cup or two of coffee in the morning. So, if you don't like coffee, then this might be a good substitute. However, it wasn't my cup of tea.There were a few things I didn't like. First, the shape of the bottle, while neat-looking, may be inconvenient for you because it won't fit some bottle holders. For me, a big reason to use bottled water is portability so I'd rather have a standard bottle. Second, I drank it pretty quickly because it was cold and I got more of a rush than I expected. With hot coffee, I tend not to drink as quickly, but I tend to drink water more quickly. Not that big a deal, just a heads up. Third, and this is my biggest issue, the Avitae had a weird mouthfeel. I think it was too soft. Most bottled water producers add some minerals back into their purified water to prevent this. I don't know if it's a product of adding caffeine or not adding minerals, but I found it unpleasant compared to the aquifer water that comes out of my tap. This may not be an issue for people used to soft water.One caveat: Vine only supplied us with one bottle. If I had more, I would've kept trying it and my opinion might be different. What I wrote above is more of a first impression.", "I wasn't quite sure what to expect from caffeinated water, but this was great. It had a nice taste to it...nothing weird. The caffeine punch was about the same as my first morning cup of coffee. I'll be glad when I can get this at my local gas station. I can see myself having one of these first thing in the morning every day.", "It's water. The taste is good (like water), no funkiness to it and no after-taste, which is good. However, as far as feeling like I'd gotten any caffeine I can't say that I did. I wouldn't pay any more for it than I would regular bottled water or expect anything extra out of it.", "\"So...it tastes like bottled water.  No odd, metallic, or otherwise flavors from this.Solved my morning headache so it looks like it wins on the caffeine side.I sort of realized something though...I LIKE the flavor of all my other caffeine options...I'm not quite sure why I need to pay for caffeinated water when I could have some tea I'd enjoy a lot more.If you don't like those but enjoy plain old water and really feel you need caffeine (how did you get addicted in the first place I wonder?) then this is a great option for you.For me the \"\"cool, caffeinated water!\"\" wore off fast once I realized that half the fun of my morning caffiene is drinking something other than water.Caffeine is also a diuretic so I'm not sure if this is all that much more hydrating than that option either (though feel free to educate me on this one...)\"", "It's no wonder that the bottled water industry is worth billions, no really.OK, so soda is bad for your teeth, even diet soda, and if you don't like coffee or tea, and simply MUST have water AND caffeine, then I suppose this is for you.Straight out of the bottle it definitely had an aftertaste I thought, after a couple of hours chilling, it tasted like every other overpriced bottle of water.Expensive for what it is, I think it will be like Coke Blac (remember that, the one with EXTRA caffeine) and will go the way of the dodo.Not for me, 3 stars is generous.", "This is one of the most unique beverages that came our way this year.This is purified water with 90mg of caffeine in a 16.9 fluid ounce bottle.It works.  I decided early on to stick this bottle in the freezer but we're in the heart of the summer heat, here in Miami.The taste.....The taste has a slight bitter after-taste.  And, you do notice it after a few gulps, but unfortunately, it doesn't grow on you.I wish they would have masked the caffeine with some kind of fruit juice.  But, they didn't.Instead, I reach for two tablespoons of sugar, vigorously shaked (not stirred) and guzzled the rest without any resistance.The result...Good.  In fact, very good.  I noticed that for several hours I was wide awake and barely noticed that I had passed 1:30 am in the morning on this computer without a yawn.If they'd add *something* to this mixture-- fruit juice, cane juice, even a couple of tablespoons of honey or natural, unprocessed sugar then this would be a runaway 5-star product.  With a slight modification, it could be.", "\"When I got this in the mail my wife looked and me and said \"\"what's the point\"\" and to her I replied with a shrug.  It's caffeinated water.  I wanted to try it.  Need I say more?  At the end of the day, this tastes like crisp clean water.  I didn't detect any aftertaste and I was more than happy to down the bottle.  Despite what anyone tells you, water tastes different depending on the label, and really only some companies can get `bottled water' down right.  As far as that is concerned, this is one of the better tasting waters I've had in a while.  But, if you are looking for a clear pick me up then you may want to stick with coffee.  I can usually detect the caffeine rush after drinking my coffee, no matter the time of day.  This, on the other hand, didn't really do much for me in that department; like, at all.  Because of that, I have to knock a star or two off, namely because the cost of the product becomes somewhat overblown when you consider the fact that it is little more than water.  You're looking at $1.52 each, which isn't a devastating cost (considering that you can spend upwards of $3 or $4 for some waters, but when it doesn't really deliver on the `extra' promise it just becomes another bottle of water.\"", "Just like different brands of regular bottled waters have their own taste to them, so does this avitae. It reminds me of the most un-softened water you can think of. It tastes a lot like the water we get straight from the tap here in Northern Minnesota (we have really good water). I don't drink coffee at all, next to no soda at all and basically just drink black tea and water. So any caffeine I get usually has to be in the form of a hot cup of tea, not always the best beverage for warm summer days. With this avitae, I can have a cold bottled water on hot days and still get an energy lift from caffeine. Also if you decide you want to liven up the water a little, you can add a few drops of drink mix to it to turn it into whatever kind of drink you want. Mixes likeMIO Strawberry Watermelon,Crystal Light On The Go Natural Lemonade PacketsandVitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punchwould be perfect to have on hand in case you're out and want to give your caffeinated water a boost of flavor. I love this stuff, and will be ordering more!", "As a big coffee drinker, I'm always interested in seeing new ways to receive my caffeine doses throughout the day (since constant coffee is not an option all the time).  When I got the chance to review the avitae Caffeinated Water, I was excited for such an interesting idea: Simple bottled water with caffeine injected into.  It is a fantastic idea (especially since it isn't flavoured like some others) that I think can really catch on.Unfortunately, the idea is better than the execution.  The main reason is because the taste isn't exactly like simple bottled water.  I tried it at two temperatures (room temp and chilled) and both forms yielded the same result.  The taste is almost like that of unclean tap water (very similar to the tap water you find in desert areas like Phoenix or Las Vegas).  While it wasn't a complete turn off, it isn't something I could or would drink on a regular basis because the taste just does not have the crisp, clean feeling of a normal bottle of spring/filtered water.Still, the idea is one that I believe will catch on with other companies, which will help improve the overall quality of caffeinated water itself.3/5.", "\"I'd never seen or heard of caffeinated water until this product popped up on Vine a few weeks ago.

For some reason, even knowing that it was just regular water with caffeine in it, I kept expecting it to taste like Sprite or something. But the truth is, it tastes just like any regular bottled water. No aftertaste either! Each bottle has 90mg of caffeine, and the whole bottle is one serving. There aren't any vitamins pumped into it or anything to make this an energy drink. That's a good thing.The cons are that the price is a bit high for this in two ways. One- you can save a bit just by getting regular bottled water and caffeine tablets. Two- only twelve per pack at this price? Yeesh.This water is a nice little pick me up, but not something I plan on buying.\"", "I just finished drinking this bottle of caffeinated water and don't know, as yet, if it gave me an energy burst--probably will find out within a half hour.  But, as to the drink itself, I can't see myself spending money on it.  I drink loads of dark roast coffee and a few bottles of Diet Pepsi each and every day and at least the manufacturer of these items had to put some effort into producing, marketing and shipping the product, not just putting some caffeine into some plain water.  It didn't taste bad, but if I'm going to drink water, I'll stick with my ordinary tap water.  I do give them credit, however, to a nicely designed bottle.", "I am amazed!  I do not know how they do it!This is caffeinated water that tastes just like, wait for it,  water!I remember ingesting no-doze pills in college.  They were really bitter, and I had always heard that caffeine itself is really bitter.  Hence, the sickly sweetness of energy drinks, that I had been told were loaded up on sugar to counteract the bitterness of caffeine. But theavitae 90 Mg Caffeinated Water, 16.91-Ounce (Pack of 12)has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee in a 500 ml (just shy of 17 oz) drink.  The ingredients list only water, caffeine and citric acid.  And yet, the flavor is of only the water.Although I love coffee and tea, sometimes during the summer, after a workout, or other time you only want water and you want a caffeine buzz.  The answer is finally here!", "I drink a lot of caffeine.  I decided to try one of these since one bottle contains the same amount as a single serving as a regular coffee.  Did it have caffeine? Yes.  Did it rock my world? No.  It is basically half a no-doz pill with a bottle of water.  I am not sure that the combination needed to be made.  (Caffeine pills are much cheaper, and since this product doesn't have any of the other herbs and supplements like energy drinks do --gingseng, b12, or whatever-- there isn't much reason to pay more for water with already dissolved caffeine, and nothing else.)I thought it didn't have much of a taste -which is good.  Could I detect the caffeine? Yes, but it was somewhat subtle --at least to my mouth.It is 500 ml of water, though, which means that unless you are really thirsty, you are probably not going to get through the whole thing in a short time, like you might do with a red bull, or a cup of tea or coffee.  So, I am not sure how effective it'll be in real life.I think if you absolutely have to purchase caffeinated water, then this is fine, but I'll probably get my caffeine through some other mechanism.", "\"This was my first caffeinated water; I usually get my caffeine fix from coffee.  This is purified water with 90mg of natural caffeine.  Says it has the same amount as a cup of coffee; I would agree ~ I didn't feel any rush of energy; about like the typical effect of a cup of coffee.  No jittery feeling like I sometime feel after an energy drink.  They also offer a 45mg option (same as a diet soda).Ingredients: Purified Water and Natural CaffeineAccording to their website - \"\"Natural caffeine is created naturally in nature and comes from coffee beans. Natural caffeine can also come from teas and cocoas as well, but we get our natural caffeine from coffee beans. Most other caffeine containing products such as aspirin and sodas use artificial caffeine created in a laboratory. We simply think that given the choice, natural is always better than artificial.\"\"\"", "The slogan for this product asks - what does purified water with natural caffeine added taste like? Nothing - WRONG. This water definitely tastes bitter.  Whether it's the water source or the caffeine - yuk. Plus the entire liter bottle has only the amount of caffeine in one cup of coffee. If there was any caffeine kick to it, I didn't feel it by the time I finished the bottle over about an hour's time. Plus the silver coloration on the bottle, while very cool and slick looking, made me do a subconscious double take a few times. It almost looks like you're drinking mercury! LOL.", "This water contains 90mg of caffeine, which is a good pick-me-up.  I drink water for breakfast every day and used this as a replacement for my normal routine.  I could definitely tell a difference in my energy level.  It is zero calories, so it is a good replacement for diet drinks or for water if you need an extra boost.  The water tastes good and you cannot taste anything that tastes like an additive.  That said, it tastes more like tap water than typical branded bottled water tastes.  This is no Fiji, Dasani, or even Nestle.  It lacks a certain crispness that those waters have.  Still, it is very good and I would recommend it if you want to get a boost without the nasty side effects that come from artificial sweeteners that are contained in most diet drinks.", "Avitae caffeinated water is just water. Tastes clean and pure the way a bottle of water should. Except, it has caffeine! One 16.9 oz bottle has about as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. So, you can look and feel cool while drinking this water, and get an added energy boost to jump start your morning or afternoon.", "I think there may be a faint bitterness in this water, but it was so slight that I'm not 100% sure that it isn't my imagination. I ended up drinking some of it plain and then deciding to add a bit of crystal lite to the rest, and that worked out fine.It's nothing extraordinary, really. It's just water with caffeine in it. If you want water that happens to be pre-caffeinated, this will work for you. If you want to add your own caffeine, there are flavoring products that include some. You could even just take a caffeine pill if you wanted. This doesn't really fall under the category of need, but I think some people will like the convenience of it.I personally feel that there are cheaper and more flexible ways of getting the same effect than buying pre-mixed water+caffeine. The bottle shape also bugs me just a little. The way it becomes thinner as you move up the bottle makes me feel paranoid that it's going to slip out of my hand. It hasn't happened, I just keep feeling like it's going to happen. That may just be a weird personal quirk.", "This stuff is horrible tasting. It tastes exactly like if you were to take a bottle of water and dissolved a no-doze tablet into it.Really bad.I got through two drinks and then poured the rest out. I suppose I could have just chugged it.It tasted oddly like if you brush your teeth without any toothpaste.I can't tell you anything about the caffeine effects of drinking this because I couldn't stand the taste.A 20oz Mountain Dew has 90mg of caffeine as well.  So at 17oz this has just slightly higher of a caffeine content.I would not recommend this product for any reason.", "If you are trying to get away from drinking to much soda or coffee than this is great. No additives other than caffine. If you are a fan of water than you might not be able to take this. It taste like extra heavy/metallic tap water. If you enjoy sucking on nickels, you'll love this. I know that sounds harsh but I still give it 4 stars because it is a great alternative to sodas for a caffine fix and your breadth will smell better compared to drinking coffee all day. However most sodas and coffees will probably be delicious as opossed to this...sooo....", "It's not the best tasting bottled water I've ever had - probably on par with the cheaper grocery store stuff, but it's not bad.  Maybe a bit of a sharp aftertaste, but I can't say that it's any worse or different from some various other bottled waters I've had.  Definitely not as good as some of the better brands, but on par with cheaper ones.I'll trust that it had caffiene in it, but since the bottle is 16+ oz, you really can't compare it directly to coffee since a cup of coffee is usually around 6-10oz.  So while it might have the same amount of caffiene as a cup of coffee, you're drinking much more liquid.  Drinking 16oz of pure water is probably better for me than drinking half that amount of coffee.But if you're trying to be a bit healthier and drink water rather than pop or coffee, this is a good alternative.", "I'm more of coffee person. I really do like my caffeine, but the aroma, warmth, and feel of coffee is the main appeal. Hot chocolate is a good substitute though.This caffeinated water is exactly what it advertises itself to be. It's just caffeine in water.

I drank it instead of getting something from the gas station, and was pleasantly surprised:- the text on the bottle boasts that avitae tastes like 'nothing'... they're right! Of all the bottled waters I've had, this stuff is actually one of the closest to 'neutral water' flavor that I can remember. Not sweet, not chlorine-y, not iodine-y, not plastic-y... just plain old water. And that's good.- 90mg of caffeine was a nice pick-me-up to keep me going through the wee hours of the night- Water won't give you bad breath or make your teeth feel sticky or make you feel weird, as some of the overly sweetened / chemical-enhanced energy or coffee drinks will do.BOTTOM LINE: I wouldn't have thought it, but this stuff is useful and the water actually tastes good.
