"], "reviews": ["Having put together two other Ravensburger Puzzle Balls (Times Square 270 Piece Puzzle Ball and Underwater World 40 Piece Puzzle Ball) with my 4.5 year old son, I thought this 180 piece Puzzle Ball would be a quick and easy build.  Unfortunately, it was not so.My son and I started assembling the puzzle ball using the same method we used to assemble two previous puzzle balls - I was sorting pieces and he was putting the puzzle together.  However, the puzzle kept falling apart and we had to switch.  My son sorted and laid out all pieces in front of me well ahead of me getting to them.  The area that includes pieces 69 through 75 was especially frutrating as those pieces just would not stay together.While some pieces won't stay together, others were difficult to attach.  During the build, the ball would fall apart at a lightest application of force when attaching stubborn pieces.  I spent well in excess of 15 minutes attaching the last piece.  As I was applying the pressure to attach the last piece, surrounding or other random pieces kept falling out.  The frustration level was so high that I was ready to smack the ball against the floor.The included assembly stand helped to hold the puzzle for the assembly of the last few rows, but it was absolutely useless in the beginning because pieces kept falling off and I had to hold the ball in the palm of my hand to keep it from falling apart. A child with small hands would not have been able to hold this puzzle like I did.  An hour later I was finally done, and, by that time, my son had lost all interest long before.The final product looks like a small globe.  It is colorful and spins easily.  Unfortunately the fun was drained from this toy by unnecessarily difficult assembly.  I like challenging puzzles, but this one is annoyingly frustrating due to poor design or manufacturing quality.  It seems like a few other reviewers had a similar experience.  I do not recommend this toy to anyone.  It is not challenging as a puzzle because pieces are numbered. It is nothing else but a small globe when assembled.  The assembly is frustrating.", "My kids LOVE puzzles.  What started out as a rainy day activity has morphed into a nightly puzzle routine.  When I saw the Ravensburger Globe Puzzleball, I thought they would love it!  And indeed they did, for the first half hour.  It's unique and really neat to look at.  However, the charm quickly wore off when they realized it could not really be put together like a 'regular' puzzle.  Matching the pictures for continents and oceans will get you pretty far, but because it is curved and three dimensional, it goes together much easier if you follow the printed numbers on the back of each piece.  We took several parts apart and finally just started matching up numbers.The puzzleball is a fantastic idea, especially because it can be used as a teaching tool once assembled.  The stand is a little flimsy, and we had the same experience as some other reviewers - if you manhandle it, the ball pops out and the globe starts to fall apart.  It does not rely on glue but rather the snug fit of the pieces and the curvature.  If you're like us and you need to take it apart a few times to get it right, the fit is not as snug by the time the project is finished.PROS:  Very cool idea, and neat to look at if you park it on a shelf.  For older kids, it's a great geography lesson while you're working.CONS:  Pretty hard to put together either way, especially for the younger kiddos.  The numbers on the back are faded, small and hard to see.  Mistakes putting it together via the picture results in a weak connection in the final product.  The stand is flimsy, and spinning the globe causes it to fall apart more often than not.So, we thought it was a great idea, and overall we liked it, but will most likely be parking this on a shelf.", "We assembly the puzzle (and took way more time that I was planning) but we have a lot of fun.This is not for someone that doesn't enjoy puzzles, it is for someone that do. It may be only 180 pieces, but the 3D factor and the fact that many pieces can be confused can generate a frustrated experience. We had fun, laugh at our mistakes when we place some piece of Africa in America... But I see how people can get really frustrated by it.For us was a fun activity, but that was how we approach it, let's have fun.", "You have the choice between two ways to assemble this globe - either you use the numbering system on the back of the tiles, or you go by the images on the front of the tiles. The latter way is, of course, much more fun. The tiles are durable and fit together real well. As for the educational value - that is mostly achieved after the assemblage has been finished and you can show and explain to your child where this toy was manufactured ...", "My daughter LOVES puzzles.  Does them over and over again, so I was excited to come across this puzzleball which looked like a fun, educational challenge.  Even better, we have a dozen different Ravensburger puzzles which are among her favorites.  Well made and fun to work on.The puzzleball?  Not so much.  First, its more of a step-by-step thing, with numbered pieces.  Sort of like working on legos I guess you could say.  There's some fun in that, but not really the same as working on a puzzle.  Second, our six year old just found it too tough to get the pieces to stay together and work it out.  I realize the recommended age on this is 8 - 12.  In this case, I have to agree with the recommendation.I loved the educational value of working on the globe together.  Just a little bit disappointed in the execution of this.  I think if I had to make a choice, a regular flat map of the world puzzle would probably be better.", "A very worthwhile project for a child and parents (and older children on their own of course), putting this puzzle together is easy. And the finished globe looks nice in addition to certainly being educational. Recommended.", "\"First, as several other reviewers have noted, this isn't really a \"\"puzzle\"\" in a genuine sense, although it has the look and feel of a jigsaw puzzle turned 3-D.  However, it's really more of a sequencing exercise.  Each piece is labeled with a number on the back (1 through 180, although the first several and last several are already permanently joined to create the North and South Pole areas).  One simply has to assemble the pieces in chronological order, following the arrows to place each subsequent piece, which builds the puzzle up from the South Pole to the North Pole in rows.  Theoretically I suppose it would be possible to assemble the puzzle as a standard puzzle (minus edge pieces, of course), but fitting the pieces together could be quite challenging.  In fact, that was quite challenging even when doing it in the prescribed order.My five-year-old daughter and I tackled this \"\"puzzle\"\" this weekend.  Because she is well below the minimum age for this product, I anticipated that she would struggle with it.  But I didn't anticipate how much even I would struggle with it.  The first few rows seemed to go smoothly enough.  They tested her patience, but she was able to do it.  But as we got closer to the middle bulge, the pieces didn't want to stay in place.  I thought it was just a matter of my daughter's lack of manual dexterity and patience, but then I too had trouble with pieces falling out until they could be shored up by later pieces.  At times I ran out of fingers to temporarily brace all the pieces that were falling out.In a bit of a switch, as we got past the center bulge and started building back toward the North Pole, the pieces got surprisingly hard to fit together.  It took a bit of muscle to snap each piece into place - more muscle than my daughter was capable of.  The good thing is that by this point you don't have to worry so much about pieces falling out, although it does happen at times.Fitting in the final piece is perhaps the most challenging of all, since you can no longer access the inside of the puzzle to support it.  We had to make several efforts before we managed to insert it tightly enough without knocking out other pieces.On the plus side, once assembled, it does make a nice sturdy little child-sized globe that actually fits on the base and rotates.  The colors are bright and attractive and the globe is up to date, at least as of the present date.  My daughter enjoys spinning it and looking at the different countries, cities, oceans, etc.  I believe we will find a nice safe place for it and just leave it assembled until she is old enough to wrestle with it herself, should she ever want to take it apart.Overall, this is a great concept, it just needs a bit more tweaking as far as the execution goes.  I was disappointed because it doesn't seem like it's quite up to the usual Ravensburger standards of quality, but with some patience and perseverance it can be done.\"", "I received this and brought it to my classroom of middle schoolers.  They loved it!  I was a little disappointed that it wasn't a little larger, I think the box says it is 8 inches tall.  The map itself is great, I loved that they added little icons of various animals and architecture related to that particular region.  More importantly the kids loved it and were interested in seeing what was in each country.  Each puzzle piece is numbered on the back and that, along with the image on the front are how you assemble the globe.  It started to get very tricky near the end of assembly, the last piece in particular.  In fact it took us a few tries before we were successful.  This is the second puzzle by Ravensburger that I have had the chance to use and I am definitely going to seek out their puzzles in the future.  They are great quality.", "The puzzle is a great concept and children seem to love globes.  What could go wrong?Well, for starters, don't try to put the puzzle together using the picture because you will eventually have to take it apart and redo it using the numbers.IF you get the entire puzzle together before it starts to fall apart- take a picture, put glue on it, put it in a glass case with a padlock-because it WILL fall apart if handled.This puzzle was a great idea but the execution of it was poor.  The box says for ages 8+ but I think, for most eights, this would be too difficult. Not because it's hard to follow the nubmers but because of the level of patience it requires to keep the pieces together until the globe is complete.", "We really enjoyed putting this together, it gave even me a challenge.It's definitely the next step on the puzzle ladder.And the finished product is exquisite and provides, as you can imagine, a good lesson in geography.4 stars for a flimsy stand.", "\"My 8 year old was mesmerized by this puzzleball.  With sturdy, curved plastic pieces, it is very different from the usual puzzles.  The back of the pieces are consecutively numbered to assist in assembling the globe.  The stand provides the base once assembly begins and though you need to keep a gentle hand while putting it together, you can easily reassemble if you find that you pushed too hard and collapsed the structure.  There are \"\"anchor pins\"\" for top and bottom once globe is completed, so you can display the finished piece on your desk or dresser, classroom or library.  Lots of detail and well worth the price.  Both fun and educational, so a win-win for kids and adults.  Unfortunately, after moving the entire thing around a few times, the turn piece on the base did snap off so the globe cannot be displayed properly.  I'd recommend not handling this too much after assembly in order to keep all the parts working properly.\"", "We've never had a globe in the family, so this caused quite a bit of excitement in my younger kids, especially as they got to put the puzzle together themselves! No glue is needed, and the entire process is quite fun for children - and really makes them use their little brains and even work in teams. My kids had a great time (even though they spent half of that time accusing each other of being stupid...). The end product looks great and even though I hated geography as a kid, I now enjoy playing with the globe with the little ones. I highly recommend this toy eitehr for your own kids or for gifting, or both.", "There is two ways to build this puzzle - by numbers printed on the back, or the usual way - matching pictures. You choose. The pieces click together nicely. It was tricky to put the last piece in. We try to put the last piece in, and when it didn't fit, we removed another piece, put the previous one in, and try again, eventually we got to the piece that worked. The finished globe stay reasonable sturdy, you wouldn't play ball with it, but it seems to be OK to pick it up and touch it. My 11 year old enjoyed working on it.", "I got this for my kids to do as they really love pputting puzzles together.  It was a pretty hard for them as the pieces didnt stay together very well and the needed quite a bit of help doing the puzzle. I would think this would be more suuited for those over 9 yrs of age.  MY boys did love the puzzle once we got it together.  Overall a great change from a traditional puzzle and would recommend to those over the age of 9.  Lots of fun and a learning experience about our the globe.", "\"This globe is rated eight and up, but our seven year old puzzle builder loved it.  The pieces are numbered on the back side with an arrow showing you which face the next numbered piece connects to.  That way, you can do it the \"\"hard way\"\" - relying on the outside, or the \"\"easy way\"\" - relying on the numbers and arrows.  After we got our daughter started, she finished the whole thing in about two or three hours with some breaks, and had a great time.When you are done, you can put the globe in the stand and save it -- we used ours for a geography lesson, and our daughter is now keeping it in her room and using it to discuss where relatives live, or where we are planning our next vacation.Highly recommended for youngish puzzle fans.\"", "As a parent, I like games and puzzles that have some educational value. I also am not as great as I would like to be on the subject geography, so putting this together was a learning experience for both my child and me. The puzzle pieces fit together easily. Like it says in the description, no glue is required. I also was impressed by the quality of product. This is printed on good quality stock and seems like it will last for awhile. Also, at 180 pieces, it is challenging, but not so tedious that one is tempted to give up halfway through. Overall, great product.", "This puzzleball is a bit of a challenge to put together, unfortunately more due to the construction than the actual puzzle aspect.  Rather than being able to go by the features of the world the numbering on the back of the pieces is actually the way to build the puzzle.  This isn't that much fun but helps keep the structure stable through the building process.  That said, the finished product isn't all that solid. Its nice to look at but not much of a toy. Overall, its a fun challenge but doesn't have much long term value.", "We had so much fun putting this together.  It was challenging but the family interaction was worth it.  We were able to talk about where we would love to travel and even researched a few places.  Now that it is together we can actually move it and look it for years to come.", "My seven-year-old son loves two things: Legos and globes.  This puzzleball combines his two pursuits into one fun, challenging toy.  He was quite proud of his accomplishment, too.  Now if only they could come up with a puzzle squirt gun.", "This is a great toy once put together and it's really cool/unique that all the puzzle pieces curve together. I guess, the drawback is that you put it together by following the numbers on the back of each puzzle piece and the arrows. So, essentially if you can count and have the time and are willing to spend it tediously snapping piece after piece together than this is for you. I guess it can be split up between 2 kids to do together or a parent/child which would be a nice way to hang out and achieve something at the end. I just thought it would take more brain power than having to organize all the pieces by number. There are a LOT of pieces, so it would take FOREVER if they weren't numbered so I'm not offering an alternative method--just if you're thinking it's like other puzzles where you are trying to match the pieces to a photo--it's not. BUT they pieces are sturdy and the fact that they aren't flat but curve around to make the globe IS pretty cool. I would say age range is def. 8-10 approx.", "My 6 yr old loves puzzles, loves maps & wanted this type of globe, so this was just perfect. What really impressed me was the incredible detail...in addition to the names of places, there are symbols, like animals, showing what the areas are known for. We could spend the rest of the year studying everything on this globe, and then some.The best part is that the pieces are a hard plastic with enough thickness that you don't have to worry about accidentally cracking a piece when you're putting this together. We chose to use the numbers to put it together. It was a great rainy day activity - nice time away from the TV!I homeschool (and I've worked as a tutor in the past), and I think this is a great teaching tool, especially if your children are visual learners.", "This is a fun puzzle to put together and is nice to look at once it is completed.  This puzzle says that it is good for children 8 + years, and I think that 8 years-old is probably on the early side of age appropriateness because the pieces are small and a bit harder to put together than those of a flat puzzle since they are curved.  The pieces can be put together by either looking at the number on the back of each piece or by piecing them together according to the picture on the front of each piece.  The rotation stand is a nice touch, but the completed puzzle does not rotate as easy as most well-designed globes.  Despite any of its flaws, this is a really fun puzzle and a great way to spend a few days.", "\"Daughter just turned 9 and LOVED this toy, 6 year old daughter also enjoyed it though both put it together the first time using the numbers on the back of the pieces.  The 9 year old and I found it fairly easy to use the picture side, particularly since there are a lot of words in the oceans and we also had a globe by our side for reference.This is a great way to learn geography since you can talk about what cities are in what countries and what countries are on which continents.Putting it together is quite fun - the kids stopped at times to examine their work and even wear the ball as a hat.  It's a little tricky getting the last few pieces in - adult assistance will likely be required until the puzzle loosens up a bit. The stand is well designed and the globe spins well and freely in it.  However, unless you plan on gluing the pieces together, this will serve strictly as a play globe since it can't really handle a lot of abuse before the pieces come apart.The complaint I have is that the \"\"globe\"\" BASE is somewhat delicate - the \"\"C\"\" shaped piece broke where it attaches to the base.  Should be able to glue it more or less.  It does come with another \"\"tee\"\" type base.If you have any questions or comments, or if you found this review helpful, please let me know!\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0431993193924427, 0.04054998233914375, 0.044946249574422836, 0.041345637291669846, 0.044160790741443634, 0.043759800493717194, 0.044162824749946594, 0.04115264117717743, 0.0433625765144825, 0.04394340515136719, 0.04350435361266136, 0.0471356175839901, 0.042403899133205414, 0.047002002596855164, 0.043144356459379196, 0.03930829092860222, 0.042011696845293045, 0.044020168483257294, 0.04415000230073929, 0.03978928178548813, 0.044636838138103485, 0.044037360697984695, 0.048272907733917236]]}
