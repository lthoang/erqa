But be aware that the first three ingredients are partially hydrogenated oils, sugar, and corn syrup.  If you are ok with that, great.  For me, I wish I didn't like them so much because nutritionally they really are awful for me.", "These French Vanilla Cappuccino K-Cups are made with instant coffee but they taste very good to me. They are light, sweet and tasty without having to add any creamer or sweetener to it at all. If you like French Vanilla then these are definitely worth a try. The only bad thing is that they contain 80 calories per K-Cup. They taste great though and they are worth it. The price on these is really fair as well and they are available on subscribe and save as well. They are usually one of the lowest priced K-Cups on the market.", "It tastes kind of fake, like fake sugar, fake cream and is too sweet, the vanilla flavor isn't that great either. I won't be buying these again.", "This is the best French Vanilla Cappuccino I've tasted.  I can't drink very much of it because caffeine really bothers me, but sometimes I make it and just drink a little of it, and it's really good.  You can add less water to make it stronger or more to make it weaker.  I usually use less and make it stronger, even though I don't usually like strong coffee.", "Even brewing into my smallest cup, this blend is on the weak and watery side.  I'm not a fan but my husband seems to like it.  Go figure.", "I think that this is a great flavour for a drink. I found that it was just right for my sweet tooth. Also the price for this K cup is not too bad. However the reason I did the four stars is because I feel you are able to get this just as well with a normal cup for cappuccino mix. This is like the hot chocolate cups in many ways instant pleasure. I would consider getting these again and with subscribe and save it is an even better price", "The flavors are wonderful and the aroma divine. The taste of these k-cups is sublime. Brew yourself a cup of  cappuccino at home and enjoy this great treat. Love the assortment. My guests enjoy the variety too.", "I had the Caramel flavored version of the product.I'll agree with a lot of the reviews that it is basically similar to what you'll get from the Cappuccino machine at a C-store. However, when you want a quick flavorful drink, it's pretty good.Note, that it does contain INSTANT coffee but regular grinds like most K-cups, I find that the last few seconds of the brew on my machine are mostly just water.Not sure if I'll buy more when I'm done with the box or not.  Also, as mentioned in other reviews, this is a HIGH CALORIE drink. The Carmel is 80 calories per cup.", "\"I'm not a purist... I almost always add a little Nestle french vanilla creamer to my coffee, and I like it a \"\"little\"\" sweet, but this stuff doesn't quite cut it for me. It's a little too sweet, and before even checking the ingredients list I thought how it actually tasted like someone had dropped a teaspoon of vegetable oil in my coffee.As other have said, it is reminiscent of flavored coffee I used to get out of a vending machine 25 years ago. I don't care for it.\""], "Gamma": [0.03131935000419617, 0.03127022087574005, 0.031218988820910454, 0.03121117316186428, 0.031254228204488754, 0.031216830015182495, 0.031268417835235596,
