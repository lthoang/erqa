This cleanser doesn't have harsh ingredients and it's paraben and sulfate free, so I thought this might work for me. It did.This didn't cause my skin to become red and irritated. It feels very moisturizing and creamy, but doesn't leave my skin feeling like there is film on it after I rinse it off. And because a little goes a long way, this bottle should last awhile and therefore is well worth the price.", "\"I have really oily skin, so when I saw the word \"\"hydrating\"\" on the bottle, I didn't have high hopes.  It's also non-foaming.  I tend to not like those.  I use a cold cream to remove my makeup.  My cleanser is for removing built up oil in my morning shower and oil and sweat after a workout.  Creamy cleansers generally don't leave my skin feeling clean, and have lead to breakouts in the past.I was pleasantly surprised with this product, though.  It isn't thick or heavy or gritty.  It hasn't caused me to break out (yet - I haven't tried replacing my PanOxyl with it, and I tend to use it in the evenings only). I did use it a couple of times to remove my makeup, instead of my regular cold cream.  The \"\"toner test\"\" showed no makeup left behind - a definite plus!It doesn't have any kind of fragrance, though.  A disappointment to me, but probably a major plus to others.I'm looking forward to perhaps trying some of their other products, as well.\"", "Own Skin Health Rejuvenating Cleanser, Anti-Aging, Gentle & Non-Foaming, Fragrance Free.I used this cleanser and I love it.  According to the tube, it says that it resurfaces fresh skin to prevent a rough and dull complextion, and it also says it rinses clean without leaving any pore-clogging residue.Everything I've said sounds really good.  I will continue to use and enjoy this facial cleanser.", "Fragrance free, if that is important to you.It has a nice texture and rinses off easily.Not sure about the age defying claims.At some point, I really don't want to pay more than $7 or 8 dollars on refined soap.The company is based in San Francisco, and not in Los Angeles, if that matters to you.  The product hence is a little bit off the beaten path.  But the question is, do you care that much.  I don't.  I just care that it doesn't smell perfumy.", "\"The thing that stood out immediately about Own Rejuvenating Facial Cleanser was its scent. It has none. Certainly, whatever scent there is was not detectable to me. That's fine. Better no scent than an unpleasant one. As for its more practical qualities, this seems to clean the skin well enough though no better than a lot of other products. There's a slightly grainy texture, but very, very slight. My skin seemed a little dry after using, but since my skin tends to be oily, that's a point in its favor. The other claims, like the claims made by all such products, are ones I can't comment on. Does it \"\"rejuvenate\"\" the skin? Does it put up a good fight against the forces of age? I don't know, but I'll give this a passing grade though, personally, I doubt I would buy this product in the future.\"", "\"I didn't find this cleanser to be anything I was excited about.  It's non-foaming, is scent-free, but is just ok at cleaning.  I don't feel very clean after using it... and with other cleansers I have used, I could tell my face was clean and all the makeup / oil / etc. gone... this one just doesn't give me that feeling after I use it.  I have really sensitive skin, so I will say a plus is that it doesn't seem to break a rash out on my skin like some cleansers have - and I would probably give the credit to the fact that this cleanser doesn't contain harsh chemicals.  The description of this product says \"\"Maximize results when combined with Own's Anti-Aging products\"\" and I am only using the cleanser, but I just can't see myself buying the whole line if the cleanser doesn't even meet my expectations of what a good cleanser should do.  It claims to exfoliate, but I could not feel a difference in my dry skin areas - I had to follow up with a different exfoliating product.\"", "The Own Products Facial cleaner is an effective way to deep clean your face. My wife has used it for several nights and while she likes it - it is not quite her favorite facial cleaner. After nightly washing her face feels healthy, clean, but not dry. The only issue that she has is that it is difficult to get completely rinsed off her face - it takes multiple rinses before it is completely rinsed off.Notes- Non-irritating or non-dryng- No aroma or fragrance- Deep cleansing removes all make-up and oil from your face- Takes several rinses to wash off - probably the biggest drawback is that it does take awhile to completely rinseFinal verdict - The Own Products Facial Cleaner is an effective nightly face wash. It is not my wife's favorite night time wash, but it is an effective night time facial cleanser.4 Stars", "My wife says that it is too soon to see any particular changes, but that the packaging is great.  Also, it goes on very smoothly and is a good cleanser.  Difficult to determine if wrinkles are removed, but it is refreshing.", "I tried this product out yesterday. Packaging was OK. Cleanser itself had little or no smell. Consistency was OK. Went on easily and washed off easily as well, with no foaming as advertized. Face came out clean. Didn't notice any miracles, but this was only my first use. Need to give it some time and see if there is improvement to my skin. Stay tuned.", "I got this cleanser because I am addicted to face care products. My husband says I have too many skin care products but I dont care. I have super sensitive skin and my senses are sensitive so i cant use high perfume products. I have tried many diffrent brands of skin care products, biore, neutrogena, simple garnier...most of them were ok but i think they were targeted towards young skin and some of them were just way to strong/perfumy. I am 35 and i need to start using big girl products. This cleanser is very nice and gentle. I love it.", "I was very glad the description explained that this cleanser was non-foaming and WHY.  My almost 60-year old skin felt very smooth and not dried out at all after using this cleanser.  I also appreciate the lack of added scent or other non-essential ingredients.  After smoothing all over my face and neck I remove it with a warm wet washcloth for a wonderful, clean feel.I also got the Refining Moisture Night Cream which I apply after cleansing and my skin looks and feels fabulous.I think it's a reasonable price for a quality cleanser and I will continue to purchase this.", "\"This is a good product but, due to my personal grooming peccadilloes in the AM hours, I only use it when I wash my face at night.  Permit me to explain.The directions say to rinse your face with water, then rub the cleanser on and rinse off.  They don't say \"\"use a face cloth,\"\" so I followed the instructions to the letter (because, perhaps, using a face cloth nullifies the effects of the product [who can say?]).When I wash my face in the morning, I prefer to come away with a freshly scrubbed feeling (i.e. as though I've exfoliated) which I can only get if I use a cleanser with some grit OR by using soap and a wash cloth. So, I tried this product for a few days in the morning and the result was apparently clean and soft skin, particularly when coupled with use at night.  However, since I didn't get that exfoliated feeling, I now use soap and a wash cloth on my face in the morning and this cleanser at night.  Different strokes. . . .So, bottom line, this product is grit-free, cleans well and gives soft skin, but you might want to use it once rather than twice a day since it doesn't seem to exfoliate (or give that feeling, anyway).I use this in conjunction withOwn Products Refining Moisture Night Creamand I'm satisfied--if not impressed--with the overall results of the pairing.\"", "Own Rejuvenating Cleanser is a nice, mild exfoliating scrub that doesn't contain parabens and is considered a vegan product.  The title of the product was a little misleading to me, because I thought it would just be a facial cleanser and not an exfoliating product.  Since I already have another method of exfoliation (microdermabrasion) I don't want to use this product too much, because it would be overkill on my skin.  But overall, it's not bad, and if you only want a light scrub, this might do the trick for you.", "I liked this prodcut very much. I have never heard of the OWN products before this so this was a pleasant suprise. Nice creamy feeling on your face-not greasy or oily like so many of them. Some of these products are rough on my skin like they are cleaning something with a brill pad but this one was nice and refreshing.Will look at some of the other OWN products in the future!", "If you are looking for a cleanser that won't leave your skin feeling stripped of every bit of natural moisture that it has, Own Products Rejuvenating Facial Cleanser is a good one to try. It left my complexion feeling tight, in a healthy and positive way. The best is that it was not like wiping my skin down with cologne!My primer and foundation went on very nicely on top of all this freshness, and it really was a pleasure to use. I am certain that I will use this product again and again. I tend to rotate all my cosmetic and cleansing items, but this one gave superior results. Recommended!", "This cleanser is smooth to work with, and feels really good on your face.  Skin feels clean and supple after cleansing, and soft.  This is a great product-I would recommend.", "\"Review of Own Products Rejuvenating Facial Cleaner.  I received this product from the Vine Program in exchange for an honest review.  This product claims to be an \"\"anti-aging rejuvenating cleanser\"\" which features a \"\"light and creamy non-foaming formula that revitalizes your skin for a fresher looking you.\"\"  In addition the product claims that it was \"\"developed with glycolic acid and vitamin E ... [which] gently exfoliates and preps skin for maximum results when combined with Own's Anti-Aging line product.\"\"  My wife reported that the product is odorless but does provide a low level of stimulation on the skin no doubt in part of the exfoliation process.  She stated that her skin felt clean and fresh.  4 Stars for rejuvenation.\"", "I am a huge OWN fan. Their products do exactly what they advertise and then some. As for the cleanser, it has a creamy consistency peppered with tiny granules. All you need is a small amount. The product does not lather or foam. It rinses away completely. After using the product, my face feels firmer, not tight or dried out. I think it looks better as well. I was a regular user of Philosophy products. Since I have switched to OWN, I couldn't be happier with the results. I highly recommend this cleanser.", "\"It may seem like I am damning this product with faint praise by calling it \"\"pleasant\"\", but I actually like that sort of experience when I am cleansing my face.For anyone used to cleansers that foam/have soap-related ingredients, this will be a switch and might take some getting used to.  It almost feels like you are cleaning your face with a moisturizer/lotion - but that also means that your skin doesn't feel dried out immediately after.  Importantly, my face nonetheless felt clean - not as if some residue had been left behind.\"", "The Own brand was new to me but I decided to give it a try and to share with my wife.  We currently use a product calledClean & Clear ADVANTAGE 3-In-1 Exfoliating Cleanser.  This product is somewhat similar - it has small grains which are the exfoliating agents.  This product is not irritating to the skin.We both feel that this product does a fair job of cleaning and exfoliating.  It is a non-foaming formula, which is ok unless you are used to something that foams.  One of the claims the packaging makes is that this product is anti-aging.  There are several ingredients which may contribute to this claim, including the ubiquitous smidgeon of shea butter, lippia citriadora (also known as lemon verbena),  pelargonium graveolens  (also known as scented geraniums) and jojoba seed oil.  The anti-aging component comes in part from enhancing collagen levels and strengthening the skin to allow it to retain more moisture.My wife and I both arrived at a similar conclusion for this product.  It cleans, but it doesn't clean as well as we anticipated.  We have since stopped using it and use other products in its place, such asPOND'S Exfoliating Renewal Wet Cleansing Towelettesand the other product I mentioned.  Don't get me wrong - this is a good quality facial cleanser, but we think there are better options out there that leave you with cleaner and better maintained skin.", "\"I guess I'm not impressed so far with this cleanser. The lack of foam is a problem for me rather than an asset. The product does clean well using a small amount of product, but it takes forever to rinse, and I admit I am not a patient person when it comes to my evening \"\"toilette.\"\" I just want to wash, rinse, moisturize and go, and I'm never sure when I've rinsed enough to know whether I'm ready to dry my face. It does leave the skin feeling cleansed, for sure, but there does seem to be a little residue behind that I'm not loving. I'm going to try using even less product than I normally would to see if that method improves the rinsing/residue issue. Will add to review if this works. Otherwise, I think the cleanser is so-so at best.\"", "Age: 56skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rocaseaNow I'm interested in exploring other OWN products! OWN facial cleanser comes in a nice sized tube that clicks shut efficiently so that no product is wasted between uses. I was surprised at the amount considering the low price; great deal! Squeezed out a little and when I rubbed it into my damp face - oh la la! It was soft and silky and felt absolutely wonderful. I have other cleansers that are nice and work great, but none of them feel as silky as this product does. I didn't notice any exfoliating ingredients . . . ? It felt completely silky to me, but maybe I'm missing something there. No matter, since I use a Clarisonic Mia and do not need extra exfoliating in my cleanser, as that would be rough on my skin.Since my skin can be sensitive and I can sometimes have flush from rosacea, I was pleased that this product did not irritate my skin at all - and no tight feeling, no feeling of residue that comes from some silky lotiony cleansers. OWN cleanser not only felt great, but left behind clean silky skin. There is no scent, although I don't mind lightly scented products, but I suppose the fewer ingredients used in a product, the better!I have another OWN product that I'm trying and am so far just as pleased.A little goes a long way, so this product is a great buy for your money. Try it!", "I really like this cleanser. I tried it last night before going to bed and it took all the grime off from the day and made my skin feel clean and moisturized. Sometimes cleansers will make your skin feel dry or tight but this did not. I liked the fact it did not foam up all over and get into my eyes. It actually did make my over 60 skin feel fresh and rejuvenated. Not greasy at all but not drying either. Perfect for combination skin like mine.", "I used it several days. It didn't do me any hard but I couldn't really feel or see any change in my skin. It's not bad but it's not great. May work better for others but I really didn't notice anything.", "I received Own Products Rejuvenating Facial Cleanser on the Amazon Vine Program.  This product is in a tube of 5 fluid ounces so a good size to have a satisfactory trial of this product.  This rejuvenating cleanser is also called Anti-aging so I am past that at age 87 but I find this product very refreshing to use.  In is creamy and not foamy just smooth and makes you feel clean.  Direction are to moisten your face with warm water then gently massage the cleanser onto your face.  Then rinse with warm water and pat dry so very easy to use and you feel the freshness on your face immediately.  Over time you can see the improvement but my skin has some deep wrinkles that I earned over the years.  With a house full of children some things have to go and taking the time to care for yourself is the last thing on your mind.There is a long list of ingredients but this creamy product feels so smooth and so I'm doing my best to keep my skin soft as possible.  I would recommend this product for all ages called OWN Rejuvenating Cleanser and the anti-aging of your skin should be enough to give it a try.", "I would say that this is a pretty average facial cleanser.  It has a little bit of exfoliating action, but not a ton.  It is unscented, but in reality that means that it just comes out of the container smelling like the tube (rubbery/plasticy?)  It cleaned my face on par with the product I had been using previously and I didn't notice any of the drying out effects that a couple of other people have mentioned.", "I LOVE how gentle this facewash feels. It's super luxurious. It smells pleasant,but natural. My only complaint is that I'm not always 100% sure I got all the residue off b/c of how creamy it is.", "I quite like this product.  Of the various facial washes I've used over the past three decades (when I started using something other than bar soap to wash my face), I do think this is the least drying product I've encountered.  The older I get, the dryer my skin becomes -- thus I usually notice a lot of dry skin on my face after I wash it.  Not so with this product, though I still use a daily moisturizer that provides sun protection.As others have mentioned, this product doesn't produce any lather -- so don't add more expecting to get some suds.  It does clean well, though.I like that this product has nearly no scent.  Too many products have added scents for no good reason.As to the claims about rejuvenation, I cannot honestly address them.  I remain skeptical after using this product for a week since I honestly don't see how a facial wash is going to rejuvenate my face any more than another product that does a similarly good job at cleansing.", "My favorite facial cleanser is White Knight, and Own's facial cleanser has some nice similarities for a lower price.  As with White Knight, it is targeted at people with sensitive skin and has no harsh chemicals.  It may even be too gentle for a lot of people, and might lead to more acne in some skin types.  However, after using Accutane, my skin is very dry, so a gentle cleanser is ideal and there aren't many that are this good.The fragrance is one area where White Knight easily wins, though I don't see this as critical.  Rejuvinating Facial Cleanser smells kind of like glue.  It is surprisingly strong in use, but doesn't linger or hurt my eyes.Overall, Own facial cleanser is a great product for sensitive skin that I look forward to using more of in the future.", "I usually do not have sensitive skin, but this product made my face super sensitive after using it to the point it felt that much of my face was burning. I used it again and almost had an equal experience.I normally do not leave negative reviews, but so far I have not have a good experience with using this product, and I will not use it again it showed me twice that it did not agree with my skin.", "\"This facial cleanser is notable partly for what it is not:  not greasy, not drying, not perfumed, not overpriced.  Unlike many milky or cream cleansers, it rinses off effectively with water, yet unlike most water-rinse cleansers, it is very gentle to my dry skin.  I use it mostly in the morning, but when I tried it at night to remove makeup, it was effective.  I don't wear much makeup, and I use a separate eye makeup remover for mascara.It has no \"\"anti-aging\"\" or exfoliating properties that I can detect.  That is okay with me, but I think the manufacturer could build more customer trust without making those claims.  My skin is super-sensitive to chemical exfoliation (acids vs. scrubs), and this product causes zero irritation or peeling for me.  It contains glycolic acid, but the cleanser is not meant to stay on skin for any length of time. A separate treatment product is probably the way to go if that is important to you.The flip-top lid and the stand-on-the-lid design are great for storage and for those half-asleep early morning showers. Given the size of the container and the small amount needed for each use, this cleanser is a pretty good value.Having outlined the good points of this cleanser, I have to say that I would not buy it.  Non-alcohol toners are equally effective for me and more pleasant to use.  I don't like the scent of this product.  It does not contain added fragrance, but it does have a scent, and that scent does not smell clean to me.  That's a personal preference, though, and for many people, this cleanser might be just right.\"", "I like that this facial cleanser doesn't have any fragrance or parabens or sulfates. It is also not tested on animals which is a must for any beauty or cleaning or beauty product that I buy. It also contains lots of natural ingredients, most of which I recognized.  It lathered pretty well and felt creamy on my face, but it took a little more scrubbing than most products to remove make-up that I had on all day.  It was a little difficult to rinse clean, so I would more likely use it in the shower than at the sink. But after using it for about a week, my skin didn't look any younger, it looked the same as if I'd used soap and water. Perhaps if I use it for a longer time, it will produce results."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.030321594327688217, 0.030774550512433052, 0.03356851264834404, 0.027180355042219162, 0.028421683236956596, 0.031686607748270035, 0.032328829169273376, 0.03138819336891174, 0.03153933957219124, 0.034605126827955246, 0.03078862838447094, 0.026315446943044662, 0.028923628851771355, 0.03387461230158806, 0.02975163236260414, 0.03231723606586456, 0.03049609623849392, 0.03225479647517204, 0.03441965579986572, 0.028779074549674988, 0.03394443541765213, 0.029529083520174026, 0.029297050088644028, 0.034410908818244934, 0.026269808411598206, 0.031138664111495018, 0.033438462764024734, 0.03116890974342823, 0.02968200296163559, 0.03414338827133179, 0.03638516366481781, 0.030856497585773468]]}
