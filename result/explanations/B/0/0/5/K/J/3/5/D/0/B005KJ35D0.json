"], "reviews": ["I'm 32, fair with freckles and as time goes by, I've been noticing more fine lines, so a night cream is necessary. I spent a lot of time outside recently and was feeling so dry, nothing was curing that parched feeling until I tried this! The Own night cream sunk in super fast and made my skin feel hydrated again. I've been using it whenever I need moisture, not just as a night cream. Very light and will be perfect for summer. I'll definitely be purchasing this again.", "Overall, I like this night cream. It provides plenty of moisture and goes on smooth. My face feels hydrated when I get up in the mornings. The reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because it feels a little bit greasy when it is applied.", "First ApplicationThere is a definite odor to this night cream, one that I disliked instantly.  The formula feels greasy for about ten minutes after using.Three WeeksSo far-no noticeable results. It's probably too early to make a call on whether this product works to reduce firmness and discoloration at this point.  It definitely has a moisturizing affect.  Despite the products greasiness, I did not notice any stray pimples.  It doesn't seem to bother my skin any.I will update this soon.", "The Own Refining Moisture Night Cream had a very good, medium consistency. It also felt very light on my face and left it pretty moisturized. I especially wanted to try the product on a dry, patchy area of my skin, and it moisturized that part very nicely. I am always excited to try a new facial moisturizer, and I hope to see this product on the retail shelves soon.", "I love being in the sun.  While I wear sunscreen, I've noticed my skin is becoming more dry and all the hours enjoying the sun are starting to show.  I've tried several creams in the past year, Clinique, Oil of Olay, Neutrogena Ageless and Philosophy.  This one seems good, but not as good as Clinique, at least for me.  I did notice some slight tightening of the lines at the corner of my eyes, and my skin felt more hydrated.  It says fragrance free, and while they did not add any flowery odors to irritate skin, it certainly is not free of fragrance.  It has a bit of an unpleasant odor that lasts on my face for about two hours.  I tried putting the cream just on my cheeks and neck, away from my nose, and it's still unpleasant.  It is nice and creamy and does not feel greasy to me, which I liked.  It also did not irritate my skin as some other creams have.All in all, it's a nice moisturizer.  It's not the best I've tried but it gets the job done, if you can get past the odor.", "This is a very good moisturizer. It doesn't have an overpowering scent, and makes my dry skin look and feel softer without being greasy. However, it is what it is... it doesn't make you look younger, it simply hydrates your skin. Which, in reality, is all we can realistically expect a moisturizer to do. The search for the mythical Fountain of Youth continues...", "\"If you have any open wounds (from pimples, etc), application of this cream will sting a bit. You will also notice that this night cream doesn't exactly smell good. That's probably why it's a \"\"night cream.\"\" But, does it do anything to you skin? Yes. Just a few days into applying it, I've started to notice my skin feeling like a baby's.\"", "Overall this product feels smooth on my skin, I think mainly because of the processed coconut fat (see my description of ingredients below). Also, since there's alpha-hydroxy acid in this product, it has tightening tingling affect when I put it on my face. I don't really like that feeling; it feels like it's drying out my skin, rather than moisturizing.It is paraben free which is excellent. But I feel like there's too many chemicals  that aren't really good for me in the long run. The main ingredient is water, then the other ingredients as follows:The second ingredient (after water) is Pelargonium Gravolens, which is Rose Geranium. Rose Geranium is a very powerful skin healer. It also helps with broken capillaries and scars, but can also be a skin irritant for those with sensitive skin. Also, you should not use this product if you are pregnant as it does affect your hormonal system.  I found the product somewhat irritating and my face felt a little flush right after applying.The third ingredient is glycolic acid (alpha-hydroxy, also known as AHA). I have been very apprehensive about using this chemical on my skin since it is a very powerful acid. Glycolic acid reacts with the upper layer of your skin and make dead skin cells breakdown. It is used quite a bit in skin peels, then washed off and moisturizer is applied afterwards. I don't know that it is good to leave it on your skin for an extended amount of time.  I tried leaving it on overnight and my face felt silky smoother (since it removes dead skin), but I can't imagine it's good to use every night!The 4th ingredient is coco-caprylate. It is a organic compound made from coconut fat. It improved glide and helps to moisturize your skin. This is a &#34;feel good&#34; ingredient, but I tend to steer away from chemical compounds and in this case I would choose raw coconut oil on my skin instead.One final comment: If you buy this in the store and see the size of the box, it looks quite big, like you're getting a big jar. In reality, the jar is only a 1/4 of the size of the box and there is a box within the box that holds the jar. I think this is deceiving on purpose! It makes you feel like you're getting a lot more for your dollar against the competitor, but in reality just a farce!", "\"I'm very pleased with this product for my ultra dry skin. Having just completed a light skin peel, I decided to try this cream on for size to see how well it performed in this circumstance (I do light peels every 6-8 wks.). The cream feels rich (as a night cream should) but not overly heavy. I felt no stinging as I normally would after a peel. My skin is moist & plump after using, without an oily residue. I could see this cream as being too heavy for oily skin, however. For my mature skin with a bit of sun-damage it was perfect. I like the mild scent which dissipates within a few minutes of applying. The majority of the ingredients are healthy/organic with only a couple (like dimethicone) being a \"\"problem\"\". I have used dimethicone without any issues, so I'm not concerned about it. This cream is what it claims to be & is a good value for the money. Many people feel it's not \"\"organic enough\"\" but I feel that's irrelevant...most products in the Health Food shops aren't either (brands like Jason, etc.). If you're truly wanting an organic brand, best to stick with one line you're familiar with. I really like this cream, and feel that it performs well without causing any breakouts or sensitivity.\"", "There's so much wishful thinking involved with anti-aging cosmetics, it's hard to evaluate them properly.  This seems like a good quality night cream, not too thick or gummy, reasonably priced, only lightly-fragranced.  It doesn't bother my eyes, which some creams do.  Otherwise, I can't distinguish very much from one moisturizer to another.", "So this review is quite mixed, and here's why:The good: The lotion feels super buttery smooth and silky, just lovely. There is no scent that I could detect, which was good. It felt really nice when I put it around my eyes and on my upper cheeks, however...The bad: ...When I put it on the skin around my mouth and lower cheeks my skin started to feel like it was burning. The burning sensation continued for at least 20 minutes. I really have NO idea why this happened, since I use facial lotion every day and have not felt that with any other lotion. The following days my skin did not feel any different (not better or worse). Also, I accidentally rubbed the edge of my eye with the same finger I previously had some lotion on and my eye started burning. I tried rinsing it, but it didn't help much. The next day my eye still felt disturbed, kind of similar to an eye infection.I don't know if I might be allergic to an ingredient in this lotion since I've never had these types of reactions before (I have experienced discomfort if lotion gets in my eye, but rinsing it usually fixes it), but all I know is that I will not be using it again.On a side note, I asked my husband to try it and he didn't experience any burning or bad side affects.  He liked the texture and the lack of fragrance. Since he thought it was fine I gave it three stars, but since I wont be using it long-term I don't know the long-term efficacy of the product.", "\"I really like this moisturizer.  It has a gel-like texture which I like because it goes on evenly and soaks in quickly making my skin feel hydrated.  If you are used to a creamy moisturizer, this product may feel very different at first.  It does seem to leave a bit of a greasy residue on my skin which is still present in the morning, this might be an issue with a day cream, but I don't find it a problem for a night cream.  It has a lovely light, citrus-y smell which I find rather pleasant.  I've been using it for about two weeks and I haven't had a problem with it on my sensitive skin.  I really appreciate the way my skin feels - it feels soft and hydrated all the way through to the morning.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!\"\") feel free to post it below.Thanks,Claire\"", "Love how this product goes on so lightly, but leaves my skin very moisturized.  It has not clogged my pores, but leaves my skin very soft.  The only reason I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars is because the scent is nothing special.", "\"I decided to test both Own Rejuvenating Facial Cleanser and this Refining Moisture Night Cream--and am so glad I did! Like the cleanser, I love both what is IN the night cream and what is not (especially parabens).  I've been blessed with \"\"good skin\"\" but this product makes it even better!  It's not cheap, but not as expensive as department store moisturizers from the cosmetic counter.  The texture is creamy but not greasy; my skin instantly absorbs it, leaving a wonderfully smooth texture with no tightness.I will continue to purchase this.\"", "Been using this cream every night for a week or so now and can't say that I notice anything but even if that takes time, I don't care for the texture or the smell or the feel of the cream. I am very selective, as you should be too, about what you put on your skin and I feel this is just not the right quality. Giving it a 2 1/2 stars but rounding down to 2.", "I certainly will buy more of this product when I run out.I loved this product so much that I recommended my husband to use it, and even he enjoys the effects.After using the product for 2 weeks, my skill feels smooth, unblemished, and I feel like it glows like I did when I was pregnant.It doesn't burn like some Lactic Acid lotions, so if it's exfoliating then I don't feel the raw abrasive feel of it on my skin. However, the results are undeniable. I'm glad I tried this product. I'd highly recommend it.", "Own Anti-Aging Refining Moisture Night CreamOwn anti aging refining night cream is a decent buy when compared to most other anti-aging creams.  I can't vouch for its effectiveness in anti-aging  but they do quote their own study results which show that it is effective after several weeks of use.  I have noticed that my skin does feel softer and seems fuller.*** Positive Points: ***- Absorbs well into skin without any greasy feeling- Leaves skin soft- Not tested on animals*** Negative Points: ***- Small quanitity for the price (1.7 oz)- Can cause mild acne for some (it did for my wife after 1 weeks use though not for me)Overall:  A decent anti-aging product at a decent price.", "If there's anything I'm picky about, it's facial moisturizer, or moisturizers in general.  I can use bottom-of-the-barrel shampoos such as Suave, but when it comes to skin creams, I'm quite finicky: nothing with lots of water; nothing with a fragrance; nothing too greasy.I'm using this night cream in conjuction withOwn Products Rejuvenating Facial Cleanserand my skin has seemingly improved with the combination.  Less greasy and blotchy, more soft and supple.  I use the night cream after I shower in the morning and after I wash my face in the evening.Note that the box that the cream comes in is overly large for the small container that comes out of it (oh, marketing people, what a not-very-tangled web you weave).  That notwithstanding, a little cream goes a long way, so not a big issue.  Just a big box.For the past several years, I've used Neutrogena's sensitive-skin facial moisturizer (Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce).  Although I'll continue to use that, I will most certainly continue to use Own Products Refining Moisture Night Cream as an alternative and/or substitute.", "I don't have many lines or wrinkles on my face but I do get dry skin that I want to keep moisturized. This cream is nice to the touch and smell but I have noticed any real changes in my skin quality from using it.", "I liked this moisturizer. not a bad smell and really helps with my dry skin. not greasy at all.  My daughter likes it as well,  I keep finding the jar missing at night!", "I have always had issues with my skin. Whether it's the occasional break-out or dryness, it's been a challenge finding the right moisturizer. I absolutely LOVE Own. The night cream has a generic smell, not offensive, but not like perfume. I am okay with that. The results are superior. I have been using the product for a month and have noticed some significant results. The crow's feet by my eyes have diminished. The wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable. Most importantly, my chin has totally cleared up. No more pimples. I think my skin looks the best it has in a long time. As an added bonus, my skin is super soft. I also use the day cream and the nighttime lip therapy moisture. I highly recommend those as well. As for the cost, it is less expensive compared to department store products. I am a firm believer in this product line. Love it!!", "This Own product is definitely non-greasy, and is very light compared to other night-moisturizing creams I've used. The cream absorbs readily, and does not take long to massage into facial skin. The rub? I don't think it's as effective as the other creams I've used in the past, and those fine little lines are creeping back into view since I switched to this product! So, the truth will be in the using over the next month as I use it up. I'm hoping I'm wrong, because I definitely like the lightweight feeling, and want it to work so I finally have the perfect nighttime product.", "The first thing I noticed about this night moisturizing cream is that it has a nice citrusy smell.  The second thing I noticed is that it spreads like Elmer's glue but without the tackiness.  However, in the morning my face feels incredibly smooth and supple and highly moisturized.Although I have not yet used this for 8 weeks, the package claims results showed it reduces the appearance of crow's feet and wrinkles around the eye area. I do not doubt it based on the results I have experienced so far.  I definitely would have loved this cream only if the feel of spreading it wasn't such a turn off to me. However, I might overlook that and purchase this in the future because the price is reasonable and results are desirable.", "\"Age: 56Skin type: slightly sensitive with slight rosaceaThis is my second OWN product and I am ready to try out more. How they made these so soft and silky, I don't know, but I'm sold.The product comes in a huge box, but actually the amount is not quite that big -- I think they could use less product packaging. However, the price for this product is reasonable considering how much there is in the jar, and considering how only a little bit of the product is needed.There is a slight tingling that I felt more after using another product first, and after looking further at the ingredients for both, decided to alternate the two instead of using them both at once. I use OWN night cream only at night, on clean skin, or over a serum. I also use it on my throat and whatever's left on my fingers I'll rub into my hands. This product  leaves my skin so soft and silky! I just rubbed some on the backs of my hands and I keep rubbing my skin there, feeling how soft and smooth this cream makes them feel!As for claims to make skin appear \"\"younger\"\" - well, I don't know since I haven't used it enough yet, and really, there's only so much most creams can do in that regard. If you want a stronger product, then you have to, really, look at a prescription strength retinoid. However, I am curious to see if I will notice any difference in my skin with continued use. But I will say this: I'd buy this product again just for the soft silky emoillentcy of the product that doesn't feel heavy - it does disappear into the skin despite its slightly \"\"thick\"\" consistency.A little goes a long way, so don't use too much.If I had one complaint - a read over a few reviews that mentioned the clean citrus scent, however, my jar has an almost \"\"old product\"\" smell - just a tinge of that along with the citrus scent. I don't know if I received an older jar, or if I'm just \"\"reading the scent wrong.\"\"A great product. I'd buy again.\"", "I took this on a trip to England because of it's great container and great feel. The cream itself is rich and moisturizing without a greasy feel. The hydration is nice, and you only need a little bit for it to cover your entire face. I also used it during the day under my foundation. Smells fresh and not scented.", "Very nice aroma, smells like orange. My skin instantly feels tighter after applying.. I have been using for three weeks and no negative side effects. It has so many ingredients that is good for skin, and reasonably  priced on Amazon.  This is my new favorite night product for my combo skin", "\"This is a very thick, rich cream intended for night time use.  According the product's packaging, it \"\"absorbs quickly (90% of women agree).\"\"  Well, count me among the 10% who don't agree, because I find that the product leaves my skin with a sticky, tacky feel to it.  When a product absorbs well my skin will feel smooth and soft; when it just kind of sits there on the surface, I get that sticky feeling.Also included on the packaging is a percentage of \"\"improvement\"\" in firmness, evenness and softness after eight and twelve weeks of use.  The problem is what were these figures based on?  User perception or measurable clinical findings in a controlled study?  Since that's not made clear, I'm not putting much weight in those statistics.The bottom line is that this product did not work well for me.  I have normal type skin that tends to be a bit oily in the t-zone, especially in warmer weather.  I have not had any problems with acne or pimples for many years, but after using this night cream for two weeks I developed an inflamed acne cyst on my chin.  Of course I can't say with 100% certainty that this product was the cause, but it's a rather compelling coincidence.Quick Facts:*Retinol free*paraben and sulfate free*mild scent (this is not a fragrance-free product)If your skin is on the normal to dry side this may work better for you.  I would not recommend it for those with combination, oily or acne-prone skins.\"", "My skin tends to be a bit sensitive, so I am careful when I introduce new products.  Right away I was a bit put-off of this cream because it had a very chemically smell to it,  but I decided to give it a go anyway to see what happened.  It didn't take long for me to notice that my skin was a bit more soft and supple.  After just a couple of weeks, my skin seems to be brighter and I notice that it is staying soft for far longer than it used to after a good moisturizing.  So far I am happy with the product and it works well enough that I am willing to overlook the smell, which isn't terribly strong but could probably stand to be improved.", "I have been using this product now for about 2 weeks.  In that time I can honestly say I have seen minor improvements in the texture of my skin and the small lines around my eyes.I have very sensitive skin so I was a little leary of trying something new on my face.  The first time I used it I did feel a little tingling but no redness.  After day three the tingling was gone.  I think that the glycolic acid probably caused this in the beginning.I loved how it went on easily and it was not greasy, this is much lighter than the current product I was using and my face seemed to drink it in.I am switching to Own night cream as it is actually less expensive than what I currently use.  I would highly recommend.", "I have been using this cream for two weeks now and I love how it quickly soaks into my skin.  The scent is clean and a bit lemony, no horrible chemical smell like some of these creams tend to have.  What really draws me into this product is the quality for the price.  You get 1.7 oz for about $20 which is a better value than most creams I have been buying.  I have super sensitive skin and this product makes my skin actually feel better.  It reminds me a bit of Aveeno's calming night cream that was discontinued.  I really want to try the other products in this line now.", "Own Products Refining Moisture Night Cream is a good facial moisterizer. I've used many and this brand is high quality. However, for the price (approx $21 via Amazon Prime), I believe .08 ounces is a small amount. If the OWN company wants to sell more, I suggest cutting their price to at least $15. So many of their competitors' products have a disgusting perfume smell, and do not work as effectively. Other than the price, I highly recommend this product.", "First impressions, nice citrus smell that isn't too overpowering. I like the thick texture (as opposed to runny moisturizers), and while it goes on thick it didn't feel greasy at all. I don't think I'd recommend using it underneath makeup, but for around the house and a night cream it worked quite well. My skin does tend to get a bit flaky at times, and this seemed to help quite a bit.I've been using it for about a week or two, and haven't noticed huge results (I have more redness issues than crow's feet). According to the info on the packaging the most significant results come after 8-12 weeks constant usage. For me, this is a good solid almost anytime moisturizer, and fairly affordable at that.Extra pluses and thumbs up to the manufacturers for making the product fluff and instructions on the packaging it came in easily readable without eye strain."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.030975187197327614, 0.03539729863405228, 0.032637376338243484, 0.03149942681193352, 0.03005114756524563, 0.03130453824996948, 0.03229870647192001, 0.02775588631629944, 0.02686983160674572, 0.03339267522096634, 0.032340340316295624, 0.03185482323169708, 0.03366485610604286, 0.030750863254070282, 0.03294981271028519, 0.029133211821317673, 0.030151261016726494, 0.02880464307963848, 0.030278615653514862, 0.031044553965330124, 0.03115179017186165, 0.03307956084609032, 0.03147903084754944, 0.030768925324082375, 0.030009815469384193, 0.03402550145983696, 0.028654981404542923, 0.029168080538511276, 0.034578822553157806, 0.03320780768990517, 0.028885716572403908, 0.03183487430214882]]}
