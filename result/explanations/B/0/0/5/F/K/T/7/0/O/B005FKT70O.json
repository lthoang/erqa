Our XBox 360 is already connected via optical cable to a decent Onkyo 6.1 surround system.  So we have pretty good surround sound with games, movies and TV.  So why would you need this Recon3D?Well, first of all, this unit is basically a SoundBlaster audio card in an external case.  It connects to your PC via a supplied USB cable (and shows up an another sound card on your device list), or to your gaming console via a supplied optical audio cable.  So it will accept a mono, stereo or Dolby 5.1 feed.  It has a headphone out jack and a mic in jack on the front.  Obviously, the headphone out jack only allows a stereo (2.0) output, so this will not output real 2.1 or 5.1 sound.  What it does though, is processes the 5.1 data and creates a stereo sound environment to try to mimic true 5.1 surround in your headphones.  How does it sound?Let's start with the PC.First, I put on some Sony MDRV6 Studio Monitor Series Headphones and I compared just the plain, stereo headphone output of some stereo music on the computer with the same music played through the Recon3D, at the same volume for each.  I can say that the Recon3D sounded *slightly* more 'crisp' (maybe a boost in the 5000-10000Hz range?) than the Realtek AC'97 chip on my motherboard.  Other than that, there was no noticeable difference.  Then I played some Dolby and THX test files to test the surround ability.  Left, right and center were pretty normal sounding.  The left and right rear had some kind of processing to make them sound a little \"\"thinner\"\" and softer than the front channels, which makes them sound somewhat like they're behind you.  The low frequency sounds (LFE channel) did not come through at all.  So if I were going to have to watch movies or play games on the computer, and had to wear headphones, I think I would choose this Recon3D over the standard sound card.  I also plugged my 2.1 computer speakers into the Recon3D, and I'd have to say it does sound better than when plugged directly into the computer as well.Now, the XBox.I usedSteelSeries Spectrum 5xB Gaming Headset for Xbox 360 (Black)to test with.  The Recon3D was connected with an optical cable, and the Dolby light on it was on, and we used the THX mode.  Compared to the 6.1 surround speakers, the sound in the headphone was much more clear and easier to hear quieter sounds like footsteps, etc.  Compared to just plugging the headphones into the controller directly, the rear surround was easier to identify, although still not 'true' rear surround since it comes from the same 2 speakers as the front sounds.  The mic worked fine through the Recon3D - nothing extraordinary.This unit comes with a software CD, which can only be used on your PC - the gaming consoles won't read it.  It installs drivers and an application that lets you adjust several things about how it processes the sounds, like THX TruStudio Pro which adjusts surround depth, \"\"Crystalizer\"\", Bass, crossover, Smart volume (auto leveling), and Dialog Plus.  I played with these settings while running their included THX Amazing Life video, but I didn't find a lot of variance in the sound through my headphones.  You can also use their Crystal Voice settings to change how your voice sounds (male, female, kid, robot, dwarf, elf, orc, etc.), but again only can be used with a PC.  There's also a mixer and equalizer you can set to your preference and save settings in different profiles.All in all, I think the main drawback with this external sound card is that it will only output a stereo signal.  I has a quad core processor to take much of the sound processing work away from your CPU or southbridge, but still has to mix everything down to 2 channels.  Sound clarity is better than your motherboard sound chip, and it can handle much more complex sound output, but still only into 2 channels.So if you are tied to headphones for your gaming or movie entertainment, this will enhance your sound experience and make it somewhat more immersive.  If you have good quality speakers and surround system, you don't need this sound card.\"", "\"To sum up what this device is in the first sentence, the Recond3D unlocks your computer's--in my case a laptop--sound capability. To even think about fine tuning any aspect that the Recon allows you to you will need to install the software that came with it. If you do not do the latter, you won't be able to adjust anything outside of the normal tuning options e.g. bass, treble, mic level. When you do install the software, you will be able to add many sound effects like:1. Surround Sound and the amount of 'surround' you want to experience. Virtual speakers will be added graphically, or removed, as you adjust the 'surround' up or down so you know what 'position(s)' the sound will be coming from. From my ears it was hard to determine whether this ability was doing nothing more than making the audio sound more hollow and deep (echoing) or really positioning sounds from different perspectives relative to you. When comparing movies with surround at maximum to my integrated 'HD Audio' on my laptop, I really could not tell much difference in hearing positionally that would have me thinking I am in a 3D listening environment.2. Crystalizer. Adjusted the overall 'crispness' of sound. Too much and it sounded digitized; too little and it sounded muffled. This actually helped turn natural sounds into \"\"natural sounding sounds\"\" contrary to my regular HD audio where the 'natural sounds' came off as running together and being 'heavy'.3. Voice/Dialogue enhancement. I left this off. It really interfered with the way voices were heard. Half way into the enhancement setting, voices came off as being made out of tin.BONUS 4. The ability to change your voice when speaking through a mic. They had around 15 or so options to mask your voice. I do not have a mic so I could not test this.These are just a few that I really liked. There are, of course, many more options.[---Sound comparison---]To start this off I will say that the 'THX mode' made the audio feel even in tone and volume while also lessening the bass. 'Scout mode' seemed to raise the volume as well as the bass, so that you could feel 1. distant or close rumbles (or virtual footsteps) through your ears, and 2. hear fainter sounds, for the volume was raised quite a bit. You can switch between THX mode--when you want a cinematic experience--and Scout mode--when you want your ears to guide you (playing video games mainly)--at will.Now, when comparing the ReconHD sound quality as a whole versus my HD audio in my laptop it was difficult to really distinguish differences from the Recon that would warrant the outright purchase of it outside of just wanting it for the sound adjustment options. I switched back and forth on the same scenes in movies, and during same situations in the same video games through high-end headphones. At first I thought the Recon was letting me hear sounds I had never heard before. However, when switching quickly back to the HD audio, I was surprised to find I could hear those same tones; I had just not been concentrating as much on the sound as I was when comparing. I will say that the HD audio sounded more muffled where it seemed that all of the sounds were on the same 'sound plane'. The Recon, when the virtual surround sound option was turned on, sounded slightly more clear and the sounds seemed somewhat distinguished from each other at different positions. Did I just describe Stereo sound versus Surround? Probably, but remember, the Recon does not have native surround sound support, just 'virtual'.I can only recommend the Recon3D to laptop users as the Recon would not be that beneficial to desktop users--who can upgrade with a great sound card for less than 100$--, and I did not test this on an Xbox or PS3. The recommendation to laptop users is to those who do not have a HD audio sound card already installed, because; this will give you a similar experience that you are already used to. If it is the ability to adjust many aspects of audio, while adding a lot of high quality sound effects, that you want, then this will open up all of those audio doors to you. If you have good sound capability as of now, don't expect this Recon to take your sound to places you only know of from high-end sound systems, or DTS cinema experiences.\"", "I bought this to use with an Xbox 360.  As it allows me to use my Sienheiser PC360 headset.  Instead of some cheap headset that might not be comfortable.I docked one star because it doesn't feature much of a volume adjustment.  And at times this makes it difficult to hear my friends clearly when we play together.", "Are you a serious gamer?  Do you have the HDTV with 5.1 surround sound, top of the line headphones with headset all connected to your Xbox or Playstation 3 (or PC)?  If you think those products have given you the ultimate in-game experience for your first-person shooter games, then you are mistaken.  You can take it to the next level.  You can take your game from 10 all the way to 11 with Creative's Sound Blaster 3D.Maybe I'm overselling it as I am more of a sports game player then a war game player, but my brother and I tested it out on one of his Modern Warfare games.  It gave the sound a bit of a boost from the standard, much like you were surrounded by it rather than it coming from the left and right.  I also tried the Sound Blaster out on my laptop.  It enhanced the sound well beyond my little laptop speakers (with headphones on), but it's certainly more geared toward gaming.", "I was very excited to try this product out since it is so unique. As soon as I opened the box, I began setting it up on a few different devices (PS3, MacBook Pro, and PC). The product right away came off as cheap and awkward. The instructions were extremely confusing, and hooking this thing up took WAY too long. Even after being hooked up, it still felt like things were missing, but because of the poorly written instructions, it was unclear as to what that could be. Let me add that I'm a big techie and I can typically figure something like this out with ease.Once I finally got it hooked up to each device, I struggled to notice any sound improvements. While there might technically be improvements, the average person would never hear it, and the audiophile would never be impressed by it. It feels like one of those products that just takes up room, and creates a big mess of wires, yet never really contributes to the overall listening experience.I would not recommend this item to the average person, although I'm sure some people would find good use for it, and even enjoy using it. I would be very surprised if the majority of people are actually satisfied with it.", "After having great experiences with bothCreative Sound Blaster X-Fi Titanium HD Internal Sound Card with THX SB1270and Creative's SB1240 external USB Sound Blaster, I was not disappointed by the Recon3D USB External Sound Enhancer.  While it doesn't benefit your PC quite as much as the internal X-Fi Titanium, it is in close competition.  The added benefit of being able to hook it up to your Xbox 360 and PS3 will make this a must buy for any gaming audiophile without a decent receiver hooked up to their consoles.Compared to other external sound enhancers, the Recon3D is about the same size, but packs a load of buttons.  You have a dedicated mute button, volume controls, instant THX, Scout Mode and a wireless connection button for those that spring for a wireless adapter (not tested).  Ports are simpler with just a usb and optical audio in on one side and headphone and mic 3.5mm jacks on the opposite end.  It's an attractive device clearly meant to appeal to gamers.The Recon3D performs well against other audio devices but can't quite hold up to my X-Fi Titanium HD's distinct voicing and controlled base.  The Recon3D produces clear, dynamic and vibrant sound, but is held back mainly by a slightly booming base line on some tracks.  The software options on the X-Fi Titanium HD help edge out the Recon3D as well, though the Recon's PC control panel offers many great features like a custom EQ, crystalizer, and many other fine tuning settings missing from my SB1240.  The THX mode and Scout Mode are obviously not helpful for music, but I also disliked the THX mode for other listening since it lent a very noticeable harsh rasp to everything.While audio fidelity in music and movies is important, the Recon3D is primarily a gaming device.  The emphasis is on playing games with Headphones and a Mic.  I was very happy with the Recon3D for gaming and found very little to fault. Using a turtle beach X41 with my Xbox 360 became a problem thanks to the way the Xbox 360 controller has to be connected to the Recon3D and the X41 headset also needs to connect it's mic to the controller...unless I'm missing something.  Otherwise, the Recon3D was superb.  The 3D effect will certainly vary from headset to headset, but overall it was a great addition.  If you don't have a receiver hooked up to your consoles, simply having a good sound processor for your PS3 and xbox 360 will be a huge improvement whenever you play with a good pair of headphones.Overall, the Recon3D lives up to it's promises and is a great addition to any video game setup, especially if you don't have a receiver or other audio device.  You'll need a decent pair of headphones (think $100+ over the ear) to get the most out of this device.  The 3D effect is very pronounced and will add not only to your performance in FPS games but to the realism of any game with ambient sounds.", "The concept of this external sound card is good - I am just not sold on the performance.  When listening, I notice greatly increased sound on both ends of the spectrum - I could notice high end sounds that I had never noticed before, so that is good, but the base was cranked so loud that my sub-woofer would shake the floor.  I had to reduce the base to 50% of what the master volume was to find the right balance.  I like it enough that I have not removed it from my system, but I am not crazy about it either.  Overall, I review this on the (slightly) positive side.  I think you get more bang for your buck with just a real nice set of computer speakers.", "The Creative Sound Blaster Recon3D is easy to set up and works with PS3, Xbox 360, PC and Mac. About the size (and look) of a computer mouse, it is reasonably priced for the quality sound it offers. In addition, Amazon often offers special buys with purchase (right now for example, they are offering promotional credits for games). Even if you are not a gamer, if you want to improve the quality of sound in your headset or speakers, this can do the job. The surround sound option is a big plus.", "First, let me preface this with the fact that I am not a hard core gamer.  This product works, but it isn't so exceptional that I would pay a lot of money for it.  Now, my teenage son that loves gaming swears that he can hear a difference.  We have attached it to the computer and the XBOX 360.  Both sound about the same.  So, would I recommend... depends on how much you have to pay for it.  Would my son recommend it, he said yes.", "\"Note: This review will primarily focus on the Recon3D's performance on Xbox 360, since this is my primary gaming platform. I do not own a PS3 and do not play FPS/shooter games -- which this is designed for -- on PC. The device was tested with a pair of fairly nice Wireless RS180 Sennheiser Headphones on 360 and a set of inexpensive JBud J2 Earbuds on PC.Creative makes a lot of wonderful, competitively priced audio products for PC. I've owned a pair of Gigaworks T40 speakers, their external Creative USB SB1095 sound-card, and a few SoundBlaster powered gaming rigs. I've always been satisfied with their performance.The Recon3D, however, is a poor offering. Marketed as being able turn any headset into a surround sound experience, the Recon3D falls woefully short in this area. Not only that, but the Recon3D's much touted \"\"Scout\"\" and \"\"THX\"\" modes amount to little more than bullet points on the box. You know those room effects you can enable for a lot of onboard sound cards in Windows? That's pretty much what those two modes amount to. Scout mode dampens out some of the louder sound effects in the mix and raises environmental noise (i.e. the hum of the overhead lights in the Checkout map in Gears of War 3) and footsteps. This does not, however, give you an advantage, as the advertising on the box would suggest. Only when you would be normally within hearing range of the noise anyway -- i.e. next to the stream in the remade Beaver Creek map in Halo: Reach -- will you be able to hear it...only louder, overshadowing the rest of the audio mix.Obviously the Recon3D can't magically boost the range of your in-game hearing -- it can only work with the sound data it's getting. But what this means, really, is that Scout mode just boosts some frequencies in the mix and dampens others. Hardly as exciting as they make it sound, and it certainly won't save you from being assassinated before it's too late.THX mode is much the same in that it boosts gunfire/loud noises in the mix. Think of it as \"\"explosion\"\" mode. It kind of compresses the mix, overshadowing more subtle sounds for the \"\"in your face\"\" variety.There is also a \"\"standard\"\" mode, available when both of the aforementioned options are disabled. It only seems to make the mix  flat and punchless -- much worse than its two counterparts.Another con for 360 users is the number of wires required to hook it up. There's four wires you need to run -- five if you want to use the mic (which, by the way, hooks into your controller, thus nixing any benefits of it being wireless) -- and while they're all included, it makes for an eyesore and irritating setup. I have my 360 hooked up by HDMI -- this device works only via Optical (or USB, if you have a PS3/PC) -- so I had to spend ten or so minutes unplugging wires in my attempts to discover why I wasn't getting any sound.The surround sound effect is poor. I found that I could find my enemies better when I just plugged my stereo headphones into my amp, rather than using any of the Recon3D's modeling modes.One positive I will note is the lack of hiss/noise when using this product. When I plug my headphones into the jack on my amp, I get a low amount of noise. I do not know if this is because the port is improperly shielded or the 1/8\"\" -> 1/4\"\" cable adapter (which I don't have to use w/ the Recon3D) does not work properly. Nonetheless, I get absolutely no hum or interference when using the Recon3D -- just the sound from the game.On PC, this functions as a DAC (I believe) and an external sound-card. It is nice that it outputs an optical signal -- good for those that have receivers with TOSlink connections. I did not test its game functionality because I only play RTS games, which really don't particularly benefit from surround sound. That being said, its music functionality/sound was fairly similar to the Creative SB1095 USB Soundcard, except the 1095 retails for about $60, which is less than half the Recon3D.  It's better than onboard audio, but there are cheaper options available that sound just as good for that purpose.I will note that it comes with a software suite for adjusting its effects. This may make the PC virtual surround performance significantly better than its 360 counterpart, since the user can tweak the settings to their liking.Overall, if you're an Xbox 360 gamer I would look elsewhere. Personally, I've never been particularly impressed with either low-end true 5.1 setups or emulated 5.1 via headphones. If you only have $100 - $200 to spend, I'd recommend either getting a pair of mid-range stereo speakers or wired headphones. Surround sound is awesome when it's done right; unfortunately, I think that it usually takes a lot of money (and a nice acoustic space) for the effect to be fully realized.\"", "\"UPDATE 08/24/13:After months of letting this sit, I decided to try again. I downloaded all the drivers and firmware, but nothing. When I plug it in, my computer notifies me that a device has been entered in one of the USB ports, but the Recon3D doesn't light up. I doubt it's the Tactic Link card in it.I downloaded Creative's updater, and it recognizes the device when it's plugged in, but the update constantly fails. It's a shame because I loved it when it worked. Now it's a paperweight.Also, I never heard back from Creative after my last email earlier this year.UPDATE 04/21/13:DEAD!My Recon3D is dead. Or, at least, it won't turn on when connected to either my Mac or Windows computers. It's strange, because my computer will recognize when it's plugged in as any sound will try and shoot to the device, but since the actual Recon3D itself won't light up (ie, turn on), it can't connect to my Omega headphones, thus defeating the purpose.I've emailed Creative to see what the issue could be.UPDATE 12/13/11:I've kept the original review below. It turns out I was missing the card, but Creative was gracious enough to send it to me so I can experience the full sound explosion in its glory. As a company, they rock. Their products are amazing, albeit overpriced.Pairing the Omega headphones with their Recon3D was easy with the TacticLink (though I did have trouble at first), and the sounds is fantastic. I tested Star Wars on Blu-ray, and, sure enough, there was a huge difference from just using the Recon3D with $20 Sennheisers. Not only do the headphones make a difference, but the Recon3D does a magnificent job of imitating true THX sound. Having the Recon3D, it eliminates the cords from the Omega connecting to the TV and PS3. You only need to connect the Recon3D via USB to the PS3 and the optical cable (included) from the PS3 to the TV, and that's it. The Omega headphones sit comfortably on their rest, no other cords, pucks, plugs necessary.It's fantastic for console gaming, but at $300 for both, it's too pricey, considering that you can find some with slightly less sound quality for under $100. While it's multi-platform (though I've only used it with the PS3 and Macbook Pro), the price can detract some, but the sound quality makes it worth it.----------Shouldn't it be the opposite? I have Creative's Tactic 3D Omega headphones, and got the Recon 3D to pair with it. It should be easier, shouldn't it? With their own products?Unfortunately, that isn't the case.While I have praised the Recon3D, that's only because I'm using them with my $20 Sennheisers. That's where the two stars come. It gets docked enormously for the fact that Creative leaves out the TacticLink, a piece that is REQUIRED to pair their own headphones wirelessly. Unfortunately, the two items separately do not come with the TacticLink, but the bundle does--? If you buy the bundle, you save over $75, but it comes with a component that you need to pair the items. You can pair the headphones with the Recon3D, but by cable only, and I don't have the necessary cable to accomplish that.Therefore, their pricing is extremely skewed, and the fact that you have to pay over $75 more for both items separately when you don't even get the necessary (\"\"optional,\"\" as Creative says) component to get the full, wireless experience, make this customer a very unhappy one. Heck, I can't even get the full experience at all because the Tactic 3D Omega can't connect to the Recon3D unless I go out and buy the cable, let alone \"\"optional\"\" TacticLink, thus leaving me behind the full enjoying experience.It's a shame because I defended the Omega in another review, but here's where it stops.\"", "I received this device and with much anticipation I installed it and used it.  The sound quality is fair when compared to the X-FI Titanium sound card, but not in the same league.  When I took it out of the box, I noticed it rattled, like there was a loose component.  So, I registered it at the support site, asked via email if it was normal for this device to rattle.  One week later, no response.  The same day I asked the question, the device stopped working.  The power light would no longer turn on.  What a waste and example of poor manufacturing standards. I returned the device for a refund.  I purchased the DSS Ear Force dolby processor.  It works great. Does not require software.  In fact, I think the sound quality in games, music and cinema are much better than the Recon 3D.The Recon 3D is over priced and compared to the competition it falls short in sound quality and construction quality.", "PROS:-Comes with just about everything you need in terms of wiring-Aesthetically pleasing, the blue glow is nice looking-Easy hook up to PC/MacCONS:-Too many wires needed to hook up to a game console-Stereo output as opposed to true digital output-Can't imagine anyone would spend the money on this when they could buy a decent pair of wireless surround headphones for the same price give or takeCONCLUSION:I'm assuming that someone out there must be drooling over this thing, it's just kind of hard to imagine whom exactly. Also, console support seems like more of an afterthought when you consider what it takes to get it hooked up. I would recommend this to a PC/Mac user due to the ease of hooking it up but for a console user looking for surround sound options, I just don't see this making much sense as a purchase.", "\"I've been using two different headsets from Creative, and while I think their sound quality is above average, this \"\"sound blaster\"\" isn't much more than a tinker toy with a fancy name.Just listen to some of these advertisements: \"\"Hear your enemies before they hear you!\"\" \"\"Gives you the edge in every game!\"\" Obviously the target audience is hardcore gamers who want to literally immerse themselves in the game--understandable, I suppose, except that the truth is this \"\"enhancer\"\" isn't going to improve your game--or your headset's sound quality--very much, if at all.On Scout Mode, small sounds do become surprisingly loud. I suppose this could help you hear an approaching enemy sooner. However, as another reviewer has mentioned, it also makes loud noises all the louder and consequently requires you constantly adjust volume levels to reach a suitable compromise.Other problems include the mess of wires required to set this thing up, and, of course, the ridiculous price of $130. For that, I suggest you get yourself a nice set of Bose noise-canceling headphones and not have to worry about needing any special enhancers. The point is, this \"\"sound blaster\"\" is only as good as your headphones. It can make things louder, but it can't squeeze blood from a turnip.\"", "\"Over the past few years, the \"\"gaming audio\"\" market has been expanding. There are two main products that compete with the Recon3D; the Turtle Beach DSS2 and the Astro MixAmp.When I purchased the Recon3D, it was the same price as the Turtle Beach DSS2. The Astro Mixamp was a little out of my price range, and I've heard that the new 2013 Mixamp has some issues. I've been using Creative products for over 15 years, so it's a name I trust. Ultimately, I'm very happy with my purchase.I am using this with an Xbox 360 along with Beyerdynamic DT990 Pro 250ohm headphones. What a huge upgrade it is coming from the cheap speakers in the TV. All sounds are much clearer and vivid, along with actually being able to identify the positions of sounds. With the headphones plugged in, it is completely silent; no low buzzing noises or crackling.The box includes everything you need to set it up, but ideally you're going to want a longer USB/optical cable (depending where your console/PC is located in relation to where you sit).The only negative thing I can say about it deals with the voice chat. I'm sure my headphones are partially to blame, but voices over Xbox Live are extremely quiet. Programmed voices coming from the game itself are loud and clear; what I'm talking about only applies to voice chat. I've adjusted the dashboard settings to have the game audio set to the lowest volume possible, with voice audio set to the highest possible volume. Changing these settings didn't help much, it still can be difficult to hear other players talking when there's a lot of action on the screen. This is where the Astro Mixamp pulls ahead, as it allows you to change the voice volume.Overall, this is a great product for gamers who play on consoles/laptops. If you have a desktop PC, there are many alternatives that are cheaper and will give you better performance. I've used the Astro Mixamp before, and personally I think the Recon3D sounds better. However if you're going to be using voice chat a lot, the Astro Mixamp is the way to go.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.3205484449863434, 0.01101773139089346, 0.0003125818620901555, 0.0005883075064048171, 0.0008565853349864483, 0.0001346673525404185, 0.2545130252838135, 0.0165182463824749, 0.10365504026412964, 0.0010930199641734362, 0.0720643401145935, 0.02480248548090458, 0.16357162594795227, 0.03017185442149639, 0.000152006366988644]]}
