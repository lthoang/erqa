Tiny, secure clipped on your clothes and effortless to use. User friendly and jams plenty!", "I was getting sick of dealing with iTunes and juggling space on my 16gb Iphone for music on the go.  Got this with a 32GB card and put a couple thousand songs on it.  Sound quality is great with earbuds and even my $200 vmoda headphones.  I was expecting the tiny built in amp to struggle powering my full sized cans at a decent volume, but this thing sounds loud and clear.It's laid out just like an ipod, so finding music is quick and painless.  Plug it in your computer and it shows up like a folder.  Drag folders or mp3's in and you are ready to go in mins,  Took about 25 mins to copy a full 30GB's to the device.  It is tiny, has virtually no weight, I find my headphone cable weights more than the device itself.  I'm sure it could clip just about anywhere and be safe to stay.  I have been getting about 10 hours battery, and its simple to charge.", "\"Got this for xmas last year and wanted to spend some time with it before reviewing.THis is my first MP3 player and I did a lot of research before deciding on this one.  Sansa seems to have a reasonable track record as far as reliability, but all electronic devices have issues on some level, which is why I was never considering the ipod route. (far too expensive, and I know several people who have had to replace ipods 3-4 times in a relatively short period of time).Plus the micro-SD slot expandability is ideal.Overall, I've very happy.  No major issues.  Some quick thoughts off the top of my head:PROS:+Good sound+easy navigation+Customizable graphic EQ - this is HUGE to me. The electronics industry for the last 20 years has gone the way of EQ \"\"presets\"\" which usually don't sound good to me.+Nice size - small, but not too small.+The clip is great.  Makes it very easy to listen hands-free.+easy drag & drop song movement onto device+excellent battery life - I listen to music & podcasts for probably 2-3 hours per day and I only need to recharge every week or week and a half.  I've never really tested or measured it, but it seems fine to me.+huge storage capacity with mini-SD slot. I've got a 16gb card and haven't filled it yetCONS (not many, really):-It's frozen on my twice, where it won't turn on.  After reading the manual, I now know that you just need to hold the power button for awhile (10 seconds? I don't remember) and it will reset the player.  This has worked both times and it has then worked fine.  So twice in 8 months isn't really an issue for me.-It was a bit wonky getting the unit to recognize the mini-SD card.  Well, it \"\"recognized\"\" it, but didn't display the folders needed to organize my files.  I think I disconnected the player from the computer and reconnected, then the folders showed up.  Not a huge deal.-I wish I could put in subfolders for my podcasts.  As it is you have to just drop them into the Podcasts folder and then hope that it will organize everything correctly.  I'm assuming that this is a tags issue, but sometimes podcast files show up in the wrong folder, or are listed as \"\"unknown\"\".That's about it.  I got my player for $30 on sale before xmas.  I think that's a fantastic price for this unit.  It's hard to know or guess how long anything will last, as modern consumer electronics are seemingly designed to fail after a relatively short period of time.  So far it's solid, and I would probably buy one again if/when this fails.  But I would also check out other brands to see what they have to offer.Oh, one more thing - yes the included earbuds aren't exactly great.  The chord is way too short and they fall out of your ears too easily.  But I've never, ever gotten a good pair of headphones or buds with a music player (have had many, many Walkmen, going way back), so this is par for the industry, IMO.\"", "as other people put, it is very good.the screen is tiny and its resolution is poor, but it IS quite useful.the sound quality is good.the expendable memory is a great feature. kills shuffle in a second.it is cheap, much cheaper than shuffle. kills shuffle in a fraction of a second.the only flaw is the clip. it is too loose. other than that, perfect. i am considering buying another one.", "I bought two of these to use when I work out. I use some of the memory for my music but bought these primarily to listen to NPR and both units failed after a few months. Everything else works great but it's failing to provide me with the FM that I so wanted.", "Pros:- Better sound than an iPod.- Can actually drive a decent pair of headphones without needing a separate headphone amp.- Doesn't need iTunes or any other crappy software to put music on it.- MicroSD slot so you can have up to 40GB of music.- Tiny, light, cheap.Cons:- Screen is tiny and useless in sunlight.- Takes a loooong time when you have 40GB of music and need to add or remove something, because it insists on reindexing everything.- Clip broke off of the back after about a year.- Cover art often fails to display, not that it matters much given the size of the screen.Overall, fine given the price, and better than an iPod, but I wish there was something better than this, yet not into Cowon price territory.", "I previously owned a Sansa Clip (newest version is the Sansa Clip+). So that is my main point of reference for this review.The Good:-Small, light and very portable.-Nice form factor.-Responsive buttons that feel great-Micro SD Expansion port-Rugged, full body, integrated clip. Very sturdy (ideal for sports)-Rhapsody compatibility-Time display within OS.The Good-ish:-Color Screen. For the price it's incredible that it even has a color screen. However it is nowhere near high res. Very washed out and not too bright. Although very usable as far as I'm concerned.The Bad:-Body Build. The previous Sansa Clip uses a great glossy plastic that feels sturdy and durable. this feels too light and seems to scratch easily, which is not good for a device that will get thrown around anywhere and everywhere because of its size. Also I have not submitted it to extreme weather, but as opposed to the previous gen of Clip, it seems the seals would not hold up well with moisture and or contact with water.-Screen Build. (Might go with above) Screen (and front plating) is made of very flimsy, thin, light, clear plstic. When little more than lightly pressed you can definitely feel the plastic bend under the pressure.-Reduced battery life.-OS froze on me 1 week into using it. Had to long press hard reset it like Sansa page said. Worked well after that. May be a freak thing. But not happy that it happened so soon from purchase.Things I miss from my previous Sansa Clip:-Power/hold toggle. Other Sansa devices have a Power/(physical)hold button that I find to be a great design decision for a music player. I cannot understand why they got rid of such a nice feature.-Round wheel buttons. (Just nice design on previous Clip)-Track reproduction time display. This OS displays a timeline and a ball that tracks the music's progress, but I prefer the actual time in number format. Or an option to view both/either would be nice.Conclusion:Very great MP3 player. Has some minor quirks. Some larger build and quality downfalls, a bit of an unstable OS. Yet for the money you'll be hard pressed to find a better color screen MP3 player with Rhapsody To Go integration, an expandable Micro SD card slot, about the size of an iPod Mini and this light. Buy it, but remember you get what you pay for. Hopefully in the long run the build quality won't be a problem. I'm very happy with mine and I'm sure it'll last a while, as long as I take good care of it.", "Sandisk I found to be the cheapest mp3 player for audio books. There was no prob using Audible manager to load my books onto my sandisk. When I downloaded my books from amazon to my audible manager, they were also automatically loaded to my sandisk too, as it was connected. The process was fast and flawless and dummy proof.If there were any issues with Audible audio books, its been resolved 100%.I also loaded other mp3 books via right click and win7 and no problem there. But, mp3 version audio books do not go into the books folder. They go into the music folder because they are mp3 not audio book format. Since my mp3 books are from LibriVox, they are sorted by book title, whole folder with all chapters, just like a album. Since audio books are all I bought this sandisk for, this works great for me because my purchased Audible books are in the books area and the free LibiVox books are in the music section.I am 100% satisfied.Sound clear. Functions easy. Pretty simple and straight forward. Easy to navigate.*I dont care about the ear buds that come with any product as I have my own ear buds I buy and never used the free included low quality ones.I have owned other sandisk mp3 players and I like sandisk a lot. Never any major issues through the years. This model is a win for me and a cheap, great way to take my books with me throughout my day.", "\"This is a great mp3 player for music.  Not so good with audio books.  After copying folders each containing a complete mp3 book, the sandisk \"\"categorized\"\" the individual mp3 files and mixed up all the books.  You can not select a folder and play just that folder.  Each of my folders (books) contains mp3 files labeled 000.mp3, 001.mp3, 002.mp3, etc.  Perhaps the naming conventions I use confused the player.\"", "Overall: I use this nearly every day from Monday to Friday. It holds it's charge well, the menu becomes easy to navigate, it's light and the clip is great for workouts. The small size is also good for travel. The sound quality is quite good - I use it with Grado SR60 most of the time.Pros:+ Affordable price+ Great for workouts+ Easy to use menu+ Light weight+ Built in clip+ Holds a charge quite wellCons:- Small screen can be difficult to see in bright lightI haven't used the radio feature yet, but all the other features are easy to use. I have an 8bg micro-SD card plugged in. Audio books work well and allow you to resume where you left off. The music is also easy to navigate once you get used to it.In 6-months of use, mine has only crashed once. I think you have to hold the top button and center button for 15 seconds to reset it (I can't remember).The small screen is color, and can be a little difficult to see in bright sunlight or at angles with glare.In summary: For the price (less than $30), this is a great little music player for your workouts or travel. The micro-SD slot allows plenty of storage space.", "My Zune 120GB hard drive finally kicked the bucket. I wanted a new MP3 player to go into my various aux in speakers around the house and for music on the go. I simply do not have space on my iPhone for more than a fraction of my music. The Clip Zip was very appealing because I could use a micro SDHC to get a 36GB MP3 player for around $70, much cheaper than a much smaller sized Ipod nano. A couple of notes about the micro SDHC. The Zip Clip can go up to 32GB. Also no need to get a card reader if you don't want one. When you connect via the USB cable it finds both the internal and external drives. At least on my windows computer it does.I dropped in the music I wanted and then went to playing it. Sounded great on my existing headphones (the included headphones are fine for an extra pair around the house) and speakers. The interface is fine. Easy to get to your music and the buttons to go forward, back, and pause are about as big as they possibly could be on such a small device. Volume on any of my headphones was more than loud enough without any distortion.Audiobooks from audible could not have been simpler. I opened up audible manager and the device was not recognized. But then you have a whole slew of products to choose from to add the necessary components. I choose Sansa, restarted audible manager and there was the device with both drives showing. I choose the card drive and noticed an audible folder had been created. I went to books on the main menu and there were my downloaded books.Firmware upating could not have been easier to update. Sansa has neat firmware update software so you just have to click a couple of buttons and it does the work of putting the updated file where it needs to go. No unziping files, getting the file to the correct folder it is all automatic. Sadly the only software on the included disc is Rhapsody. I had a Sansa player years ago. I was not a fan then and I am not now. I would highly suggest if you install it at all NOT to make it your default player for any file. I am still using my Zune software to download podcasts. Rhapsody does not have any ability to download podcasts. But any software you are using now to download podcasts should work. Although I have to download them to my computer and then transfer them over to the external drive. No big hassle though.The FM radio works great and is very simple to use. Go to the station you want. Hold down the middle button and the station is added. Repeat. Then just press the middle button and it goes from preset to preset. Could not be easier.But something that is not easy, getting the Zip Clip out of the packaging. Be prepared to have a scissors handy when you get your Zip Clip home. The device is in plastic that is virtually impossible to get at without a scissors. I suppose a necessary evil for packing in retail stores to avoid these going into people's pockets. Still annoying though.The device itself is incredibly small and lightweight. And the clip is pretty sturdy and secure. All in all Sansa did what Apple should have done a LONG time ago, allow you to expand the memory with a storage card. Right now a 16GB Nano goes for almost exactly twice what the Zip Clip PLUS 32GB micro SDHC card goes for here on Amazon. So you end up with a small ultra portable great sounding MP3 player for half the cost of the Nano and over twice the memory. Rather then decide what part of my music library at any given time to take with the Nano I can just take all of it with the Zip Clip.I rate the Zip Clip as pretty user friendly. With a little knowledge of MP3 players and file transfer you can figure out the menu, playlists, audiobooks, storage card, radio, and firmware updating in less than an hour more than likely. The user manual is a download is you want it (great choice Sansa I appreciate the saving of trees). While the software is no where near iTunes, it doesn't take much work to get the Zip Clip loaded up with what you want, and not much work at all to add any additional files you want to. Getting a GOOD very enjoyable MP3 player thatr does everything I want well with twice the memory at half the cost of its main competitor, I have no regrets and highly recommend it.", "I've been enjoying my Clip Zip.  It is simple to set up and import files to.  I bought the 4GB and it holds all of my song library.  If needed, I could buy a memory card to go in the side.  But, I don't think I'm going to need one for quite some time.  All I wanted this for was to play music.  I have an IPad for videos.  The screen isn't all that impressive, but it gives you a small album cover and the names of the artist and song.  You can shuffle the song list or choose by artist, album, genre, song title, or playlist.  Moving files from my computer to the MP3 file was a snap.  Just had to drag and drop.  Click click click and the thing was loaded....FAST.  It came with the battery already charged.  Charging the battery is quick too.", "yes ive been using htese sansa for years now...and yes things change..and yes they have changed the charger...bummer now have to have 2 different charges at work and home for the older models and newer ones...also purchased these open boxed saved a couple of bucks and came with no earbuds..bummer..but with that out of the way....i enjoy the battery life and ease of use...", "I have owned this product for almost a year now.  I purchased it for the purpose of always having music on me with little worry about price.  After traveling around in my car, on my bicycle, and on foot, this thing still plays the same as the first day it was delivered.+ Storage capacity can be expanded up to 36GB using MicroSD, which is more than my old Zune or iPod classic would hold.+ Battery holds a charge decently enough...longest period of time I've had it running continuously: 4 hours, and the battery wasn't even drained more than 50%.+ The MicroSD capability means it's easy to transfer your tunes and set up playlists on pretty much any PC.+ Lose your iPod, and the cost is anywhere between $100-$400 plus the headache of setting one up all over again.  Lose this, and you're out maybe $40 (with accessories) plus a quick re-copy of your old tunes/playlists.- There is a slight delay when skipping tracks - not a huge detractor, but it's there.- It's not built to take huge amounts of abuse on its own - buy a cover and keep it from getting crushed/using under extreme temperatures.Bottom Line: This is a great alternative to buying a more expensive media device if all you're looking to do is play music.  Keep in mind that it's not built with rugged abuse in mind...treat your investment well, and you'll get many hours of enjoyment out of it for far less money.", "This mp3 player does several things so well.1 - Excellent sound.2 - Sturdy clip.3 - Easy to use interface.4 - Supports multiple formats.5 - Expandable memory.I do not focus on the stopwatch or the radio, but I do know those features have been accessed on the device.  But, as to what I consider the main five areas, it does the job very well.If you want a quality - small - easy to use mp3 player - and are not tied into the itunes world, this is the device for you.", "I have one on the charger and one in my pocket. I use it for music, audio books and radio, almost all day long. Can't sleep, no problem.Bookmarks would have been a nice addition, but otherwise perfect.", "\"I have a purple, orange, white and gray SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip because of the stellar performance of the purple one. The MP3 players that arrived after the initial purchase (the purple one) somehow have a problem with playlists. For some reason, when I create a playlist in Windows Media Player, it shows up as a playlist in Windows Media Player when I click on the device icon in WMP, but when I try to look for a playlist on the device, no playlists can be found!! This is maddening. Instead, for whatever reason, the SanDisk programmers in China (if you don't believe me, just look at the playlist on the device on the WMP software and you will see a translation of playlist in what looks like Chinese) somehow do not understand what a playlist means, and instead your playlists that you create in Windows Media Player show up in the \"\"Albums\"\" section of the player. Go Figure!!The micro SD card does work. If you are a music fanatic, this platform is the best price performance that hands down beats the Apple iPod players, because the programmers assume that the grand majority of users are going to use these devices for music. Hence, all of the content is placed as children in the \"\"Albums\"\" menu selection. This device may work well for music, but for Audiobooks it is quite frankly, disappointing. I am disillusioned and must give this device no more than three stars. Fortunately, I have a number of Creative MP3 players where I can use other MP3 ripper software and then use Creative Centrale to organize my audiobooks.I will have to figure out a way of somehow adding playlists to this device. Right now, this looks like an almost impossible task.\"", "I've had this for over a year and love it.Pros:Inexpensive.Good sound.Very small.Decent storage size.Solid state memory, so good for sports.Usable screen and decent interface.Runs 3-6 hours depending on volume and radio/versus mp3 playing.  MP3's require processing and slightly more power.Cons:Not water proof, but the buttons started working after drying out.Previous to the water, the lower toggle down stopped working, but I can scroll using the up toggle.  Annoying, but this has gone jogging over one hundred times.It's plastic so don't drop it, but so light that the earbud wires usually catch it before it hits the ground.Overall, a good deal and I would recommend it to a friend.PS- Those who complained about a permanent shutdown should try resetting by holding the power button down for 5-10 seconds and releasing.  I had this happen and was up and running again in 30 seconds.", "The purchase of this SanDisk Sansa Clip Zip * GB MP3 Player SDMX22-008G-A57G-Grey Color on my part was to provide me with a sound source to feed into amplifier and speaker projects to test them for sound delivery.  I probably won't use it as others will to play music into a set of ear buds, but maybe I'll use it that way more when it is not in my work bench area.  I stores a lot of different music to choose from for my purpose of sound testing and does provide a dependable source of sound.  Sounds as good as an MP3 can sound as far as I can tell.  Battery life could be better between charges.", "This is a very nicely put together mp3 player.  I have been able to use Audible and Overdrive services with no problems at all.  The only problem I had was using a Transcend 4 gig micro sd card that just did not work with the player.  I replaced it with a Sandisk 32 gig class 10 and no other problems since.  I like the way they changed the menu so that &#34;Book&#34; is now a category on the main menu.  I too listen mainly to audiobooks.  I have loaded mp3 and wma formats without any problems.  Slotradio cards work fine too if you can still find them.  Unlike the clip + the clip zip has the micro usb which I don't like as much as the mini usb.  The nice thing is it is  not the plug the fuse had.

The touch screen is too sensitive. Just brushing against it changes the music played. SanDisk seems to have solved that problem. I buy these units because of the extra storage with the MicroSD chip. I find the reproduction quality of the supplied ear buds superior to some quite expensive ones I've purchased seperately.", "I am very happy with the 4gb Sansa Clip Zip. The price is very much worth it. The sound is excellent. Easy to use. I love the podcast part with the resume from last session feature. All around this is a great product. It does exactly what I have been wanting in an MP3/Podcast player.", "I originally was thinking just get a phone with a really good player since its about streaming music online these days.  However, it always takes forever for the phone to boot up unless you always keep it on and there are no physical buttons to skip tracks on the phone.  Basically, the phone tries to do everything and sometimes you just want a mp3 player.Enter this little player which is great sounding and easy to use.  It has the physical buttons and turns on immediately.  The only downside is back to the old-fashioned usb connection to grab songs from your computer but I figure I'll preview music at home first and then upload it to this player.  It's like an extra step but saves me from constantly recharging the phone.  Back to the basics.", "Good mp3 player could be a better FM Radio. It has presets but you can't just jump from one preset to another with a button, have to go thru several menus. The old version (batteries) once you set your presets, you could just use arrow key to advance each preset.", "I bought this one because it supports microSD card and looks simple to copy music from a computer to the player. Everything looks good except creating the folders for songs. There are 2 different modes for USB connection. I just used the default one to connect the player to my computer and then created the folders. After disconnecting the USB cable, I found that the names of some folders were displayed with strange characters. It took me hours to figure out the reason.Pros: Lightweight, expansion slot for microSD card, simple file transfer between player and PC, 10-hour music playing, standard charging via USB port, acceptable priceCons: Tricky to create and name folders properly", "This is a good solid mp3 player with basic functionality. It isn't super fancy, but it should have everything you want just to listen to music. I ended up buying this after my last 2 iPod classics have locked up and even a hard reset would not bring them back up. I decided I wanted something with a micro-SD slot and ended up getting this due to the generally positive reviews and fairly inexpensive price.One thing I like is that you can simply copy your mp3s to the microSD card through Windows Explorer and it doesn't require any extra software (it does come with some software though I didn't install it). One thing I don't like is if you copy an actual folder to the card, the player will actually rename that folder by adding about eight random numbers and/or letters in front of whatever name it already has. So, for example, if you keep all your mp3s in folders named after the artist and album title and copy those to the microSD the player will then rename all those folders with the seeming randomly prefix so that they are no longer in alphabetical order. If for some reason you need to find one specific folder you'll have to either look through the folders one at a time or do a file search. It does not rename the individual files inside the folder though, but it still seems kind of pointless. This isn't a huge deal since the only place it matters is in Windows Explorer, but it is still annoying. The instructions also say you can use Windows Media Player to sync music to it. I have not tried this, but it is nice to know it is an option.The battery life is pretty good and seems to be fairly close to what is advertised. The sound quality is decent, though on both headphones and in my car it seems to lack bass. The size is nice and small and is great for carrying during running or working out. Overall, I'm happy with this and would recommend it unless you are an extreme audiophile or need a lot of extra bells and whistles.", "I killed my last SanDisk Sansa MP3 player.  I clip it to my heart rate monitor strap for concealment.  Its perfect because its size and the buttons.  Touch screens look good, but for exercise, you can't go wrong with actual buttons.I believe I killed my last one because my sweat dripped into it and shorted it out.  It didn't happen until I started running/biking indoors and sweated more.No real complaints other than maybe the battery life could be better.  I think the color screen (vs the older one blue only) and the screen is a tad bigger than the old one.  The buttons DO NOT light up like the old one did.

I have other mp3 players and use them often but got this for use in my car where having room to place it is at a premium. I had very low expectations for this but for its intended use I did not need all kinds of features. But this has quite a few functions and it is very easy to use and because it uses standard connectors unlike my other Sansa players it is really simple to charge and load files.  The sound quality is good but I have mostly listened trough pretty low end head phones or through my care radio so not sure how high quality the music would be but at the price I got this at it sounds petty good.", "I got this Clip Zip to use at the gym. It sounds pretty good. Get yourself some good ear-buds and it will sound very good. Sometimes I have trouble with the power button. It takes a couple of presses to get it to operate.

I do like the small size, but it is almost too small to be practical.I am very disappointed in the overall quality of this device.  It just looks and feels cheap.  OK - it is cheap, but I was hoping for better from Sansa.First the packaging is a joke.  I almost needed a chain saw to open the plastic container.  I'm surprised they haven't been sued for someone cutting themselves and bleeding to death from trying to open their terrible plastic packaging.The USB cable is way too short, but not a big deal, as I have longer ones laying around.The biggest complaint I have is the color screen is just too small and terrible looking.  Why even bother with a color display that looks this bad?  The toggle switch feels like it is going to break any second and the menu structure is not intuitive to use.  Why they even bother putting headphones this bad with an MP3 player is a mystery to me.  Why not add a little more quality to the player and forget the worthless headphones?  The sound is marginal at best but will pass as a workout mp3 player.  My other Sansa players sound better and don't have the cheap build quality.Mine is still working after the first couple of days, but I have no confidence it is going to make it through the month.
