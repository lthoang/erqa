"], "reviews": ["I was excited to try this product, as I usually have bars for breakfast, but it is getting harder to find ones that have good nutritional profiles in breakfast-appropriate (i.e., non-chocolate) flavors.  I love cranberry, so this bar seemed nearly perfect, especially given that I checked out the nutritional content prior to ordering.  At 4 grams, the amount of protein was a bit low for my liking, but the bar made up for this by being low in both sugar (12 grams) and saturated fat (1 gram) while being very high in fiber (7 grams).The texture of this bar is the first thing that struck me as a bit odd.  Although it is moist (i.e., as opposed to hard and crunchy), it is not chewy; in fact, it breaks apart easily and is a bit on the crumbly side.  (I suppose it is somewhat similar to a a CLIF brand bar.)  The taste, however, was quite disappointing:  rather than the tart taste of cranberry or the sweetness of orange, I detected only a bitter flavor.  It tasted almost as if the bar had been flavored with the bitter rind of the orange.  There did seem to be little fruit pieces in the bar that may have been cranberry, but unfortunately, the unpleasant bitterness overpowered everything else.I thought the first bar that I tried was just okay, but the second one seemed worse, and now I'm afraid I might have to toss the whole box (which I HATE to do--I hate being wasteful, so I might try dipping them in yogurt or something just to get through them).  Perhaps another flavor by this brand would be better, but unfortunately, I can't recommend these.", "Like some of the other reviewers, I like to eat nutrition bars for breakfast, or as a quick snack.Unfortunately, these bars taste pretty bad to me. And the nutrition value doesn't make up for the poor taste.They have only 4g of protein and a lot of sugar, so they don't make for a very filling breakfast. Also they are very dry, need to have a drink when you eat them, so that makes a poor choice for a on-the-go snack too.I thought it was OK as pre-workout, perhaps because of the sugar giving me a little energy boost... but still, I'd rather just eat a cookie if I want a sugar spike.Also, the Orange Cranberry flavor has no noticeable cranberries or cranberry taste. Though it does have a strong orange flavor, it tastes like orange extract, a little bitter and tangy.", "this bar is delicious and filling.the best thing about it is the subtle mix of chocolate with the tang of orange and cranberry. it is also moist and very chewy to boot. there is also the presence of some oat and nut pieces just to remind you that you are chewing on something good for you.since receiving them, i have been snacking on them between meals or right before a four-hour rehearsal. after eating one, i feel full and my energy is well-sustained for the entire rehearsal.this will be on my list of purchases for my summer trip to teach at arts camp!", "You can't really taste the fruit, and the texture of the bar leaves something to be desired. It's just too dry, is the problem.The chocolate is nice, through, and the size is just about perfect. Also, they really do function well as a nutrition bar and are quite filling. I'm a big guy and I was able to eat one of these in place of lunch and easily made it to dinner.", "\"The first thing I thought when i bit into this bar was \"\"WOW!\"\" The orange flavor is intense but not overwhelming. It's crumbly and sweet and delicious. The flavor and texture are perfection.It only has 4g of protein, so it's not exactly going to keep you full the way a normal protein bar would, and it has a whopping 200 calories, so it's certainly not a light snack. However, with 7g of fiber and lots of other healthy ingredients, you could certainly do a lot worse. Chose this over a candy bar, you won't regret it.\"", "I ate and thought, but I wasn't able to smile after trying these. They had a number of negatives, and not much going for them. The best I can say is that they are convenient if you need food in an instant.The texture of the bar was a surprise. It was cakey, firm, and rather smooth:  I was unable to feel oatmeal, nuts or cranberries, although I could see the oats when looking at the bar.  I was completely turned off by the taste of these nutrition bars, because the bitter taste of orange skin overwhelmed any other flavor I might have enjoyed. Cranberry-orange is one of my favorite flavor combinations, so I had high hopes for this bar. I was unable to taste any cocoa, but that might be because I just finished my box of Valentine's Day chocolates. The bar is supposed to have more antioxidants than a cup of green tea, so they might be an option if you like orange peel and hate green tea.These bars weren't overly nutritious, either.  They pack 200 calories into a little 1.8 oz (51 gram) bar, and a quarter of that is fat. I was surprised to see that the bar had 10 mg. of cholesterol, which although it isn't a huge amount, it's not common to find it in the nutrition bars I occasionally buy. I presume it's because there are eggs in this bar. Between the eggs, soy, chicory, nuts, flour and milk, these bars have a lot of potential allergens. (The bars have more glycerin than any flavoring ingredient.  Glycerin can be an allergy trigger) I was not surprised to see that there is more orange peel than cranberry in this bar, and that there is less than 2% cranberry. There are few vitamins and not much protein (4 gram) in them, either.I can't think of a reason to buy this bar, unless one needed calories in an instant and had no other choice. Try a piece of fruit and a handful of nuts for a convenient lunch that tastes good, is healthy and travels well instead. If you want an Eat, Think, Smile bar that tastes better (but carries about the same nutrition,) you might want to tryEat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar, Dark Cherry, 1.8-Ounce Bars (Pack of 12)instead.", "Certainly not the most appetizing snack on the planet. But a lot of that is just how dry it is; make sure you have a beverage handy with this! I recommend hot tea of one kind or another. That might not be super convenient if you just want to carry these to school or on a hike in your backpack for when you need a quick, healthy boost. But it definitely makes them more palatable--trust me! In fact a nice hot tea makes them downright tasty if you're in the mood for such a thing; one of my favorite aspects is that they aren't too sweet.", "This bar is by no means health food.  I would recommend any Kind bar over these.The are numerous sweeteners, including: brown sugar, dextrose, brown rice syrup and sugar.  The primary ingredients are corn, wheat and oats which makes for a dry and crumbly product.The taste, despite all the sugar, is bland and slightly bitter from the orange peel.  A drink is required.  It's hard to stomach without a glass of milk because of the dryness and poor taste.", "I'm a little surprised that so many people didn't like these.  I loved them!  The texture and taste are both excellent, and they're filling as well.  Many other nutrition bars I've tried don't really curb my hunger, but these do.  It's nice to find something both filling and healthy.  I plan to keep buying these and try some of the other flavors, too.", "These Orange Cranberry bars are, first of all, delicious.  They have a cake-like texture that is very pleasant and the flavor is just the right mix of fruit and chocolate, not too sweet and not bitter or bland.  They're good enough that you may be tempted to eat several at a sitting, but don't do it!  They're also relatively high in calories, so you'll want to save them for times when you need to fuel up, such as after a run or workout.  In that case, I think they're ideal: they're filling, delicious, and transport relatively well.  They do crumble if you put any weight on them or stress the bar, but you can still eat the crumbles out of the package.  My husband was slightly put off by the look of the bar, since it looks very dense and brown, but as soon as he tasted one he was a fan.Over all, I'd rate these very high for the specific post-workout situation, but only three or four stars as a regular snack.", "\"I ordered a box of these Orange Cranberry as well as well as the Oatmeal Rasin flavored bars through the Amazon Vine program. Frankly, I cannot think of why anyone would buy these alleged \"\"health\"\" bars. Each of these bars are 200 calories, have 7 grams of fat, 10 mg of cholesterol a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrate and only four grams of protein. Also, based upon Recommended Daily Allowances for a 2,000 calorie per day diet they don't provide any Vitamin A, 6% of Vitamin C, 4% of the recommended Calcium, 6% of the Iron, 8% of Thiamin and 10% of Magnesium. At the time of this writing, this Oatmeal Raisin Flavor bar was not yet available for sale but different flavored 12 packs of this same brand of bar sells for around $19. Not only do these bars fall short from a true health standpoint but they're not very good tasting either. They're not terrible but the consumer would definitely want to have it with coffee or tea. As a stand alone bar it's got kind of a chalky texture. There are so many truly healthy and good tasting bars on the market that I don't see this brand becoming a favorite in many households; certainly not in ours. I would have been mad if I had actually paid for these bars.\"", "\"I've tried a number of \"\"nutrition bars\"\" over the years.  There are certain characteristics that make them acceptable and desirable:1.  Taste - they have to taste halfway decent.  I realize these bars in general aren't supposed to be candy bars, but in the heat of competition or need, a bit of taste isn't bad.2.  Calories - one of the reasons for having a bar is to supplement your diet.  For example, I ran 10 miles this morning, costing me about 1000 calories.  Most bars are in the 200-300 calorie range.3.  Fat - I'd like the calories from fat to be less than 30%.4.  Ingredients - when push comes to shove, organic, whole grains, and few additives is my goal.5.  Fiber - at least 6 grams of fiber per serving helps the world go round.6.  High fructose corn syrup - avoid, avoid, avoid.7.  Consistency - they shouldn't fall apart as you are eating them.So this particular bar, Eat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bar (Orange Cranberry) has a nice taste (and some orange peel and cranberries in the ingredients!), is 200 calories with 50 calories from fat, has 7 grams of fiber, is a bit crumbly (don't eat it on a treadmill), and is mostly whole wheat, corn, and oats (nice).  It's not vegan.In general, I liked it.  Better than some, but I'm not giving up myClif Bars.  Clif bars are less crumbly and made of USDA organic ingredients.  However, Eat. Think. Smile. Baked Nutrition Bars are not a bad option when Clif bars aren't around.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.08282733708620071, 0.08135087788105011, 0.09245955944061279, 0.08847451955080032, 0.08692233264446259, 0.08033688366413116, 0.0838763639330864, 0.08546717464923859, 0.08379651606082916, 0.08043020218610764, 0.07884552329778671, 0.075212761759758]]}
