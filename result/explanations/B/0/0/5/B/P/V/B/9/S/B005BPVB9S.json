"], "reviews": ["The all-natural ingredients make for very pleasant reading - with dried cane syrup; rice, wheat, corn flour; and sesame seeds combining to provide a delivery vehicle for the anti-oxidants contained in cocoa. Unfortunately for me, the taste of cocoa was so strong, that it overpowered everything else - I could barely detect traces of cinnamon or the other ingredients.While I was very pleased with the fact that there is practically no chemical aftertaste, I don't see myself becoming a fan of this product.Happy Snacking!", "These are highly addictive and great by themselves or on top of cereal or yogurt. What I particularly like is the good chocolate taste without being overwhelming. It is more of a smooth taste that the cinnamon touch adds to. I can't imagine anyone who likes chocolate not enjoying these. Recommended.", "\"If you think healthy \"\"natural\"\" snacking has to be synonymous with bland or unpleasant, think again.Eat. Think. Smile. Sweet Cinnamon Crispy Thins are actually a fun, tasty, surprisingly addictive treat--that is, once you get beyond the first bite, which does admittedly have an initial \"\"health food\"\" vibe.But the lasting impressing on your taste buds is one that comes surprisingly close to the taste of the tops of brownies.  Despite the so-called Sweet Cinnamon flavor, what really comes through is a generous kick of cocoa, provided by the company's trademarked blend of two cocoas--one African and the other an anti-oxidant-packed Meso-American variety called Lavado.For those who aren't dark chocolate fans, it could seem overpowering, but I like it.  I also appreciate the fact that each six-ounce bag gives you approximately six 120-calorie servings of a generous 46 pieces each--although your chocolate craving should be satisfied long before popping that many.Personally, I could live without the sesame seeds on top, which sort of conflict with that brownie-like experience, but it's a minor quibble for a healthy snacking alternative.\"", "This is the perfect snack when you're in the mood for something chocolatey and something crunchy.  The snack has a rich chocolate/cocoa taste with a hint of cinnamon; if you're looking for a strong cinnamon flavor, you may be disappointed. i found it to be a lighter flavoring which I though was just right. Though the first ingredient is sugar (dried cane syrup), these aren't very sweet and i think they would appeal more to adults than to children.A serving size is 46 (!) pieces, with about 6 servings in a bag. Each triangular piece is about 1/2 inch. A serving has 120 calories with 35 calories from fat. Total fat for a serving is 4g (of which 0.5g is saturated, none of which is trans fat); no cholesterol, and 30 mg sodium (1% of your daily value); total carbohydrate is 22g (7% of your daily value) of which dietary fiber is 2g (8%) and sugar is 9g.Though a serving size sounds large, these are really addicting - it's easy to just keep eating them. Yum!", "Everything about this product seems to scream health food.  From the product name to its packaging to its touting of the many healthy ingredients used, it looks like it's some sort of wonder health food.  Yet a quick look at the ingredient list reveals that the very first ingredient is...sugar.Now, I'm not saying that this is necessarily a problem in and of itself.  If you're looking for a sweet treat and you're debating between, say, this and a candy bar, I'd definitely urge you to go for this.  However, it's certainly worth noting that this product has a lot of added sugar so, for all its otherwise fairly healthy ingredients, you'd be better off eating some fruit or a slice of whole grain bread with whole fruit spread.However, as a treat, I think these little bites are nice.  I like the crunch and the contrasting textures of the oats and sesame seeds.  The serving size is generous--over 40 bites--but the pieces are small, so you may not be getting as much as you think you are.  Still, because these are so full of contrasting textures, I find that I only need a small amount to satisfy a serious chocolate craving.  They have a nice cocoa flavor without being overly sweet, and the cinnamon adds a nice, warm touch.It didn't really surprise me that I liked these crackers; the real challenge was my kids.  Both my eight-year-old and my two-year-old like them, though, so they serve as a decent alternative to graham crackers.", "I am pregnant, so I am trying to eat as healthy as I can for the baby. When I saw this, I thought it would be a great snack for me to snack on at work when I get my chocolate cravings. They are very chocolatey, almost reminds me of the cereal coco pebbles but more bitter chocolate taste than sweet, an adult version. I get a touch of the cinnamon taste as well in each bite. I like them, easy to eat the bag in one sitting if you are not careful though.I was a little weary of sesame seeds and chocolate but it I like the combination. Although, on the front of the bag it shows a lot more sesame seeds on a crisp than it really is in the bag. Actually the front of the bag makes the crisps almost unappealing because at first glance it looks like meat instead of crispy thins, especially with the sesame seeds on it. But, you can't judge a book by its cover because once you open it up and get a whiff of the chocolate and start eating it, any thoughts of meat are gone.It is 46 pieces per serving and it has about 6 serving in it. 120 calories, 4g fat, 30 mg sodium, 9g sugar.", "When I first tried this product, I did not really care for it. I decided to give it a few more chances over a week or so, and now I'd have to say that I like it more than I did at first (hence the 4 stars instead of 1!).First of all, I am a person who likes things that I consider super sweet. I am a health nut and my craze for sweet foods is a killer; I've tried so many times to rid my place of sugary stuff, only to have chocolate given to me as a gift or falling to temptation while grocery shopping. I decided to give these treats a try; while not exactly 100% healthy, they are a much better option than eating that candy bar or piece of pie.I was not happy with these at first because they really aren't *that* sweet, and like I said, I really like sweet things. I've only recently begun to like dark chocolate in the past few years; these remind me of the amount of sweetness you'd find in various types of dark chocolate. I wasn't sure how I felt about the hint of cinnamon, and the sesame seeds threw me for a loop.After giving myself various opportunities to try this product, I decided that once I knew what to expect (only a hint of sweetness instead of a slap in the face of sweetness!), they tasted better to me. I like the hint of cinnamon. I'm still not 100% crazy for the sesame seeds (that keeps me from awarding the 5th star), but it's not like they're so horrible that I refuse to finish the package.Overall, I say that you should know what to expect when eating these, and then you might not be as thrown for a loop when you try them. Don't expect them to be as sweet as, say, Cocoa Puffs cereal, but DO expect them to give you that slight hint of chocolate that might just satisfy your craving (without going crazy on calories).", "I love chocolate and cinnamon. The combination of both with a wonderful crunch is surprisingly good. Eat, Think, Smile, Crispy Thins are a bit healthier than other chocolate treats out there. So, in essence, this is a product that I will probably purchase again -- especially when I have guests and need to have an assortment of goodies on the table.", "The combination of cocoa, cinnamon and sesame seemed like an odd one, but it works!  The packaging also indicates there are oats and brown rice included, although it's the cocoa and cinnamon which are most noticeable.While I'd say the 120 calorie serving size, with six servings in a bag, is optimistic, this snack is probably healthier than most, so the calories are well spent.", "Eat. Think. Smile. Crispy Thins, Sweet CinnamonNever one to shy away from trying something new, if a snack product boasts of being all natural and antioxidant -- on the front of the package --, it usually ends up in my shopping cart, especially of late, 'cuz that's the way I roll. :)Eat. Think. Smile. Crispy Thins, Sweet Cinnamon was an especially nice surprise, as I found it to be crispy, crunchy, not messy, with an extraordinarily satisfying cocoa/sweet cinnamon taste -- that did not leave me feeling bloated/over stuffed, if ya know what I mean.  The extra thick zip-lock like re sealable bag really came in handy, as I was tempted to eat more than one of the 6 portions contained in the bag.  It is that good!  :)You might also like to try, as I did,Eat. Think. Smile. Crispy Thins, Savory Sea Salt.  I can't make up my mind which variety I enjoy more...  Highly Recommended!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2012", "These crisp and slightly sweet bites are totally awesome!  I munched them solo for a satisfying afternoon treat with coffee, I placed them in a community bowl for sharing with friends at a patio gathering, I scattered them over the top of a fruit salad and in each and every instance, they were a total knockout!  The slightly sweet, cinnamon and chocolate taste contained in these crispy little puffs are both satisfying and pleasing to eat.  I love them.", "\"Something about these puffy little cinnamon-chocolate snacks reminds me of eating breakfast cereal as a snack. They're not quite crackers, they're not quite cookies. They're also not very \"\"thin\"\" despite the name. They're more puffy than that. They're sweet, crunchy, and tasty, with a nice chocolate punch. A single serving serves me as a satisfying treat, without having a lot of fat or calories. Some vanilla soy milk or green tea is a nice accompaniment. I haven't tried red wine yet, but I bet that would be good too.My husband thought they seemed a bit too \"\"health food\"\". They're definitely not candy, like he was hoping for. But if you want something that is sweet, salty, crunchy, and chocolately, while still being relatively good for you, these are perfect.The chocolate is pretty intense. I do wonder if eating a lot of these would have a stimulant effect.\"", "I have to say, after eating the bars that I got through vine here:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005BPVE5Y/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleI really was afraid to try these.  The bars are AWFUL, but surprisingly, these are pretty good.  They taste a bit like a cinnamon cereal.  They have a nice crunch, and I like the sesame seeds on them.  You can't really taste any of the cocoa in them, all you taste is the cinnamon.  (Which is good, because I don't think chocolate and cinnamon flavors mesh very well.)My husband, who despises any of the stuff I get with natural ingredients, really liked these.  And also my 5-year-old did as well!  They're a good snack, and I would get them again.", "Chocolate crunch food with natural ingredients.  It is a lot like a chocolate version of Chex.  Pretty good stuff.  Can go with milk in a bowl lke cereal.  I keep a bag in my car for snacking on those long drives.  Great taste.  No aftertaste.  Chocolate.", "Eat, Think, Smile, Crispy Thins, Sweet Cinnamon snacks are crisp and crunchy. These are a very nourishing snack. I woul have like somewhat more taste to them, but overall the are satisfactory. They are not bad, but for my taste I would have liked more chocolate and/or cinnamon taste.", "Hands down, the best new snack I've tried in years!  Seriously, I will be ordering more of these immediately, as these did not last long around my house...These are crispy, with a great (but not bitter) punch of cocoa powder in every bite.  The sesame seeds add a great flavor to them as well -- these are just such a perfect snack when you want something sort of like a chip, but also have a sweet tooth.  Love them!  So did everyone who tried them.  I would give these 6 stars if I could!", "The Sweet Cinnamon flavor Crispy Thins from Eat. Think. Smile. are an interesting snack idea.  The underlying concept of all of their products is that their cocoa is not alkalized the way that most is preserving more natural antioxidants.  That is all well and good, but it still comes down to taste, right?  I like chocolate and cinnamon, and I found these to be pretty good.  The texture is a little different, but I don't mind it.  The only thing I would change would be to make the pieces bigger.  If you wish to stick to a single serving, you would be stuck counting out 46 (that is not a typo!) pieces.  They should triple the size to make the serving come in around 15 or so, and it would be like most snack crackers.  Otherwise I think they are a hit.  If you are looking for a healthy sweet snack and like chocolate and cinnamon, give these a try.  The taste starts out chocolate with a cinnamon finish.", "Being on a health kick for the last couple years, I am always on the lookout for tasty snacking alternatives.  The Eat Think Smile brand boasts an all natural snack with the natural antioxidant of cocoa.  The product is small bit size and fun to eat except for a flavor that is listed as Sweet Cinnamon you can barely taste the cinnamon at all as the taste is vastly overpowered by the taste of cocoa from the first bite to long after you finish thanks to a strong aftertaste.  It is alright but the type of food I would only reach for if the rest of my cupboard is bare.  It is also nice that the bag is re-sealable to keep the food fresh.", "I was skeptical after I read all the negative reviews, but these are delicious!  They're perfectly light, have a tasty whole grain body, and are topped with sesame seeds.  I felt like I could taste every ingredient.  Furthermore, the chocolate tasted very authentic (as it should) and definitely not artificially so.  One downside is that I consumed half a package within a few minutes...but the nutritional information is encouraging.Can't wait to try the other varieties!", "If you like the flavor of cocoa, you will probably like these. They are light and crunchy in a way similar to another snack product that has a cheetah for its mascot. They are all sort of triangular in shape and about a quarter of an inch thick.I didn't really notice much cinnamon flavor, but the cocoa comes through quite strong.They have sesame seeds on them, but still taste sweet through and through. The sesame seeds add texture than flavor.I'm a choco-holic, but not a big fan of cocoa.I thought they were ok. I didn't feel the need or desire to eat handfulls of them at a time, which is really a good thing.", "I love chocolate, and I love cinnamon.  I, of course, for sure thought these would be a huge win.  Sadly, they're kind of not.  Its not that they're bad.  They aren't.  Its just that they're not really good either.  They're forgettable.  You don't want to eat the whole bag - which could be a good thing if you have self control issues.  My problem - I feel like 6 bags of these will last forever.They have an impressive serving size (46 pieces per 120 calorie serving/appox 6 per bag) but then I doubt I'd even want to eat that many.  About the size of a goldfish cracker, in the shape of a triangle, you'll find a kind of chocolate tasting, kind of cinnamon tasting cracker cookie with sesame seeds on the top.  It tastes confused.  Not really like chocolate, not really like cinnamon.  Why are there sesame seeds?They're just okay.I ate them in desperation when I had nothing else that looked good to snack on, but haven't touched them since.  They're doomed to remain open but forgotten.I was honestly hoping for something that tasted like a marriage of the chocolate/cinnamon teddy grahams - but healthier with less sugar. Sadly, these are nowhere close.", "ETS's crispy thins are basically 1/2 inch triangular snacks that pretty tasty and good bang for the buck.The treats are very crunch and can be eaten as a cereal if desired.  They aren't too sweet and one serving (around 46 pieces) is pretty filling while only packing 120 calories.  (The snacks are so filling that I almost wonder if this accurate).  They have a very subtle cinnamon taste and like all ETS products, they also have a very subtle cocoa taste as well.The packaging easily opens and closes and keeps freshness.  Out of the three ETS products I have now experiences, this is by far my favorite.", "Very flavorful snack and I love the cocoa flavor! Couldn't taste a lot of the cinnamon but enjoyed the flavor nonetheless. It's great as a snack alone or on top of yogurt or ice cream. The great thing about the product is I could identify & pronounce all the ingredients in the crispy thins. And if the claim is true about having antioxidants, then all the better! Even if it doesn't, it's still a great snack and very different from what is normally on grocer's shelves.", "I really love these crispy thins.  They remind me of really good dark chocolate bars with chili and cinnamon in them.  Yes, I even added some chili to get a true Mayan taste out of these.  I did however think that there weren't six servings in a bag.  I did measure it out and an ounce is about 39-40 thins not 46 like the packaging claims.  Which makes five servings, not six.  I measured this a few times with my scale and got 39-40 thins in an ounce.  I think one of the addictive properties of this blend is the cane sugar and it has a lot of it, so I tend to only have an ounce at a time, if I can drag myself away.  I could easily eat six ounces of this product without thinking...just eat without the think but I would be smiling! :)  It has a good sweet cinnamon taste, if they added a little chili or had a chili cinnamon flavor, it would probably be one of the best treats ever.  This also works as cereal or blended with oatmeal, I've tried eating them a lot of ways.  They do remind me of a luxury level Count Chocula, the cocoa used is very flavorful and the addition of rice and sesame seeds works with the cane sugar and cocoa.  I am not sure if this is health food, but I don't really care.  I love it anyway.  :)"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03591267764568329, 0.040974780917167664, 0.04121420904994011, 0.039979200810194016, 0.04116642475128174, 0.04039512574672699, 0.04829897731542587, 0.04207651689648628, 0.04099494591355324, 0.026393165811896324, 0.0438794270157814, 0.04500315338373184, 0.039586570113897324, 0.042979031801223755, 0.0478232242166996, 0.04167388752102852, 0.04367925971746445, 0.05196571350097656, 0.04225590452551842, 0.03868914023041725, 0.041658807545900345, 0.04023268446326256, 0.04021422564983368, 0.04295288771390915]]}
