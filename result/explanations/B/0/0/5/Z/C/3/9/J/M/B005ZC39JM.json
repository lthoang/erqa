"], "reviews": ["This is good granola! There were flavors that both myself and my husband really liked in this variety pack plus he took the oatmeal to work for when he forgets his lunch. He thought it was great and easy to make. We had the pancakes for brunch and they were easy to make, though a touch heavy. He loves the additional seeds and I'm a picky eater but I still didn't mind them. It's nice that its an American product made by a small company.", "The granola is the breakfast cereal type, essentially a flake-like mix of grains, nuts and fruit.  There are no large clusters for easy finger snacking.  Nevertheless, the flavor is pretty good.  Not overly sweet, with a nice blend between the nuts, grains and coconut.  Though I am not wild about cocout in my granola.The O.S.M. Oatmeal was not so OSM (apparently the new with-it way to say &#34;awesome&#34;). The instructions were disappointing - &#34;Cover a bowl of oatmeal with hot water or milk, microwave for 1 minute&#34;. Really?? That's the best they could do. The flavor is okay, but the texture left much to be desired. Worse than even Quaker One-Minute oatmeal, the Bunnery oatmeal was pretty mushy, except for the sunflower seeds (nice addition) and the millet (not so nice addition). Millet is best when cooked well. After 1 minute (or even the several minutes when I cooked the oatmeal on the stove using a Quaker 1 to 2, oatmeal to water, ratio), the millet is uncooked, so the crunchy texture gives way to a burst of raw flour into your mouth.TheO.S.M. Pancake and Waffle Mix was better. Leave out the millet and it would be pretty good. Once again, the time it takes to cook a pancake really is not sufficient to hydrate and cook all the starch in the millet granules. So you get these crunchy, floury blobs in your pancakes.At least, this time there were decent directions.", "\"The Quick Version:  Nice assortment of minimal ingredient, packaged foods.  Predictable granola (tasty, but not revolutionary.  It's granola.).  Fantastic waffle/pancake mix and delicious, easy to prepare oatmeal.  Definitely will purchase the sampler again plus extra bags of the mix and the oatmeal.The Longer Version:Bunnery Breakfast Sampler is a fantastic way to try a few different flavors of granola and two pantry staples and, at the time of this review, it was affordable at less than $32 (and it qualifies for free super saver shipping for folks who are not members of Amazon Prime).  I have gotten granola before that was $8/bag, so this seemed like a good deal and a great way to try a new company and some new granola.Our favorite item in the sampler is hands down, the O.S.M. Waffle & Pancake Mix.  They taste like most other \"\"whole grain\"\" waffles but these have oats, sunflower seeds, and millet.  I thought my texture averse kid would protest but he wound up eating so many waffles that I had to empty the bag and make another batch so we could try them.  There are very few foods he eats (many make him gag) willingly and it is a joy to find a waffle/pancake mix that includes a variety of healthy ingredients as his diet tends to be rather limited (aside from smoothies which I can covertly add nutritious seeds, nuts, and the occasional veggie).  They cook up just like regular waffles, but they do have extra whole bits of millet, so it has a little texture and a little crunch and the flavor is mild but an improvement over \"\"plain\"\" waffles.  We all ate them without syrup because they were perfect and flavorful fresh out of the waffle iron.The oatmeal was good, but McCann's Irish (the quick version) is more kid-with-feeding-issues friendly (one universal texture).  I would choose Bunnery OSM as I like the texture, the heartiness, and the addition of Sunflower Seeds means that Bunnery is a wee bit more gentle on my blood sugar (more fiber, more fat, more protein compared to our usual oatmeal).  Bunnery OSM Oatmeal is also quickly prepped in the microwave, so I find that I'm enjoying it more frequently as it sticks to the ribs on those wicked busy days.The granola is tasty, and the ingredient lists are very minimal which I definitely appreciate.  Simple, good granola.  That being said, it's granola and it arrived fresh and crispy and it was yummy but not the most amazing thing I have ever eaten.  It was what I would expect from a bag of granola.  Not particularly exciting or groundbreaking but tasty and simple.  The bags have zip seals on them, so they are easy to close and stash for later.  I will be adding a few new bags of the granola to our Hurricane kit because they are pretty versatile in an emergency and they combine healthy ingredients with comfort food appeal.I will definitely be picking up another Sampler and probably a few extra bags of the O.S.M. Waffle/Pancake Mix and the O.S.M. Oatmeal as those definitely deserve status as staples in our panty.\"", "I have a hard time convincing myself to eat breakfast some mornings - a cup of tea is all I want. However, when I have mixes like these ready to go, it's a lot easier to talk myself into! And knowing that every ingredient in the list is in English and doesn't need a scientific dictionary to understand certainly helps.The sampler contains pancake and waffle mix, oatmeal/hot cereal mix, and 4 kind of granola. We tried the pancake and waffle mix first, making some pancakes. I really liked the mix - there was a small bit of crunch, and it was healthy without being over the top. I threw a few chocolate chips in and a little vanilla and it was an excellent breakfast that the kids don't know was reasonably good for them. Even plain, they were very tasty.Next I tried the oatmeal, and while I really liked it, I have a small quibble with the directions. They say to put the desired amount in a bowl and cover with warm milk or water. That is a little imprecise for me - so I measured out 1/3 c. of oatmeal mix and 1/2 c. warm milk before following the rest of the directions. After the bowl sat for a minute to cool, the oatmeal was pretty stiff - so I added some more warm milk and some dried fruit. You may have to play with the proportions to get the texture you prefer, but overall I was impressed. It was extremely quick, very helpful on school mornings. The flavor was great, and the addition of a little dried fruit and a bit of turbinado sugar was perfect.And the granola - it's *all* delicious! It is not overly sticky, it's nice and crunchy, and not too sweet. My favorite was the cranberry, but the blueberry was a close second. Great for just eating with milk, adding into recipes, or even eating straight out of the bag! This is how I like my granola.All in all, I am extremely impressed by these items. I don't know that I would buy the granola regularly (far too tempting to just sit and eat a bag), but I think we will be buying more of the pancake/waffle mix, and probably the oatmeal mix. Great to have on hand and know that it's not junk I grabbed at the local grocery store.", "\"I've now tried everything included in this Bunnery sampler and it's all absolutely delicious.My only complaint is that the nutritional information quotes the granola in terms of a 1 ounce serving.  Who in the world is going to eat just 1 ounce of this yummy granola?  Pretty much no one.  So I think it's misleading to quote calories and such for 1 oz of granola and 2 oz of oatmeal.  It would make a lot more sense to use more of a real world serving size, in my opinion.I just tried the pancakes for the first time.  Wow!  They're terrific.  Full of chunky natural grains with a wonderful flavor and texture.  Best I've ever tried hands down, and I've been around for awhile.The oatmeal is also the best I've ever tried.  Chunky, slightly crispy, very quick and easy to prepare and quite yummy.I've been wolfing down the granola too.  All flavors are excellent.  I probably prefer the blueberry and banana honey nut.  But the \"\"regular\"\" granola and cranberry nut vanilla versions are also extremely tasty.The ingredients are all natural, quite simple, and there's nothing that sounds like a chemical or additive or makes you think, \"\"Hmmm, what's that?\"\"I also think the price is quite reasonable.  You're getting a lot of very high-quality, very tasty food for a very modest price that may include shipping.5 stars all the way!  Great stuff!  Just keep an eye on those calories due to the unusually small listed serving sizes.\"", "The granolas are tasty, with first rate fruits.  Unlike most store bought granolas, these are not too sugary.  Expensive though, as even the granolas at 12 ozs average $5 per bag.  But, price is relative to buyer, so if one wants first rate quality, it's here.", "\"When I received this sampler, I was so excited to see the ingredients--all 100% natural, with no HFC, MSG or other distressing ingredients.We tried the granolas first. They were tasty--especially the blueberry and cranberry flavors. The banana granola was kind of weird--like a bad batch of banana bread. They went well with yogurt, pudding, milk or coconut milk. They were also fine just straight from the bag as a crunchy snack. I thought the cloves really overpowered the other flavors in each one--I'd leave that out. I'd also like to see some other kind of oil beside canola used. The nutrition panel is misleading, since their serving size is only one ounce--who eats just once ounce of granola? To compare with other brands, you'd need to multiply the numbers for each item by 6-8, in order to reflect a more realistic serving size of 3/4 or one cup.Next, I tried the \"\"oatmeal.\"\" It's actually a blend of rolled oats, cracked wheat, oat bran, wheat bran, millet and sunflower seeds, so if you are on a gluten-free diet, you will want to avoid this hot cereal. The bran makes it more like an instant oatmeal than the old-fashioned oats I normally eat, so you don't have to cook it as long. The millet and sunflower seeds give it a nice variety in texture. Their serving size is 2 ounces (1/4 cup), but I think twice as much is more satisfying. Tastes good with cinnamon, raisins, nuts and stevia.Just tried the pancake/waffle mix today. If you follow the instructions on the bag, the batter is rather pasty. I added more milk to make it pourable. Again, the millet adds an interesting texture, but the finished product was a bit dry and bland. Of course, I have a homemade recipe that is \"\"to die for,\"\" so I'm a bit spoiled.All in all, I'd say this is a great little sampler. It would be perfect to take on a camping trip, as all the bags are resealable and easy to pack.\"", "\"I love granolas to have on its own for breakfast or just to snack on without anything added.  I've purchased from many brands, including buying granola from natural stores, and found the Bunnery granola much less cloyingly sweet than the typical granolas that I've eaten in the past.  All the flavors are really pleasant, with hints of coconut and have a good amount of large clusters and not too much \"\"granola dust\"\" inside.  The resealable pouches are great for keeping fresh, although I found myself finishing each bag fast enough that in all fairness, the granola probably didn't have much chance to go stale!  That should be a solid indicator that the taste is excellent, but if you do prefer your granola/cereals on the sweeter side, a touch of honey or maple syrup added should do the trick.  These are excellent for topping yogurt too, with a bit of cinnamon sprinkled over the granola.The oatmeal from this sampler pack was a little less stellar for me.  I found the extras that were included to be a little too harsh in taste, as I typically only eat rolled oats for oatmeal.  I felt this cooked oatmeal needed a lot of fruit and some natural sweetener to be as enjoyable as my usual oatmeal but for those who like a bit more health kick and nutty flavor to your oatmeal, this one could be a great option.The pancake/waffle mix was the only item I didn't get a chance to make at home yet, and will update my review once I've tasted this mix.\"", "I enjoyed this sampler. I liked the pancake mix and the oatmeal. I liked some of the cereal better than the other. I did not like the blueberry but the rest were good.", "I'm rating this a 4 out of 5 because I think all the granola types deserve a 5, but the oatmeal and pancake mix were about a 3.The granola is great. It's nice and sweet, which is how I like it.  It doesn't come in big clumps, but in small bits, which makes it really easy to eat as cereal.  It's definitely high in calories- the blueberry granola is 120 calories per serving, which isn't much, but it takes three or four servings to make a normal sized bowl of breakfast cereal.  Luckily it's pretty filling, so one bowl was enough to tide me over for a while.The oatmeal and pancake mix both have the same problem in my opinion; they contain sunflower seeds.  I actually love sunflower seeds, but not in something I want to be smooth and sort of melt-in-your mouth.  When I take a bite of oatmeal or pancake, I really don't want to spend a whole minute chewing up hard sunflower seeds (and they're not chopped up or anything; it's the full kernel).  They also contain millet, which I thought was a great idea.  Some people won't be crazy about it, but I love the way the millet sort of pops when you bite down on a piece, and it adds great flavor.  It also doesn't make you chew forever before you can swallow.  I would really like to try a version of either of these products that doesn't contain sunflower seeds.Overall, this is a great variety pack.  It would be good as a gift or to have in the house when guests are expected.", "We really like Bunnery Natural Foods. This sampler is a perfect introduction.The granolas are very flavorful without being overly sweet. The fruit and berry flavors are true. The bunches are the perfect size. I really love this granola.The oatmeal is fairly standard good oatmeal. It is not as textured as steel cut but it doesn't get as mushy as grocery store stuff.It's easy to cook.The pancakes are nice and light. There is not an aftertaste (baking powder?) that some mixes have. It is easy to cook up.These are great products and I highly recommend them.", "I have a deep appreciation for natural foods. It always makes me feel down to earth, connected to the planet and like I'm doing something good for myself. Granolas can be wonderful unless it contains unwanted, or refined sweeteners.Bunnery Natural Foods sample pack arrived from Amazon Vine and what a treat! Five point five pounds of nutrition packed goodness! Opening the box was like looking into an Easter basket of pastel colored eggs. The Blueberry Granola and Original Granola are sweetened with honey. The Cranberry Nut Vanilla and Banana Honey Nut Granolas are sweetened with honey and rice syrup. The O.S.M (oats, sunflower seeds and millet) Pancake and Waffle Mix is sweetened with a tiny bit of brown sugar and the O.S.M. (could also be pronounced awesome!) Oatmeal is not sweetened at all. All of them are tasty and full flavored.Bunnery Natural Foods frustration-free packaging is easy open rip tabs with re-sealable bag. The granolas arrived in 12 ounces packages, the pancake mix 18 ounces and the oatmeal 15 ounces. According to nutrition facts, one ounce is a serving. Even three ounces didn't really hold me till lunch on its own. But, I added one ounce to a 10 ounce fruit smoothie enhanced with protein powder and that lasted me 5 hours.The labeling on the sturdy bags is easy to read making it clear what you're getting as well as a mountain shaped see-though window to display contents. Bunnery Natural Foods are made in Jackson Hole Wyoming. I figure if it sustains the cowboys out west, it will sustain the cowboy at my breakfast table. Five stars.", "The first thing we did with the Bunnery Breakfast Sampler was go through all 4 varieties of their granola. My wife and I loved every one of them. The granola has a great consistency--that lightly cooked crunch that we like. It's not overly sweetened and not overly baked, so the granola forms either very small clumps or just individual oatmeal flakes. All the flavorings--fruits, nuts, seasonings, etc.--taste fresh and natural. And as an added bonus, the granola holds up well when sprinkled over a bowl of yogurt and mixed with fresh fruit.The oatmeal with sunflower seeds has a wonderful flavor and fully absorbs the milk or water we prepare it with for a full-bodied, natural taste.The pancake mix has some extra graininess built in. It cooks up nice and light, though, but with good body that lets you know there's fiber and healthy ingredients in there.The price is a little high for regular use at home, but it could make a great gift for natural breakfast lovers out there! Enjoy!", "If you are looking for some really good and all natural granola and breakfast items then Bunnery Natural Foods Breakfast Variety is what you would want. Since I have begun to eat more natural and whole foods these were right up my alley. The Granola comes in 4 flavors, Banana Honey Nut, Original, Cranberry Nut Vanilla, and Blueberry. There is a package of Oatmeal and a package of Pancake and Waffle Mix to total 6 packs in all. The Granola is packaged in 12 oz packages while the Pancake Mix is 18 oz and the Oatmeal is 15 oz. They are all natural with no additives or preservatives just plain what you get. The Granola says it serves 12 and I am a little more generous and say it has 8 servings. The Pancake mix says 9 servings but I think about 8 would be more like it there too. The oatmeal is right on with 8 servings as well. The taste of the granola is not very sweet but just the right amount of sweetness to make it yummy. You can use the granola as a topping for yogart for example or in a nutrabullet mix as well. My favorite is the Banana Honey Nut. The oatmeal is not instant but it cooks up in the microwave and tastes quite a bit like the Irish Oatmeal I bought from another company. The directions are not too clear unless you know that you cover the amount of cereal with water or milk (there are not measuring amounts given). The pancakes do have directions and contain brown sugar in the mix along with sunflower seeds and wheat. They are great too with honey and cinnamon. These packages are not diet foods and contain natural sugars even though they are low in sugar grams and carbs as compared to the other products out there. I will definitely re-order.", "You have not had pancakes until you've had Bunnery waffle and pancake mix.  I am in LOVE.  The pancakes cook up easy, they are cruchy oat and sesame seed.  I put a little butter on them and it was heaven.  I packed the left over ones in plastic bags in the refrigerator to take to work.  Popped them in the toaster at work and voila.So far I've had the banana granola and the cranbery nut granola and both are very yummy.I will be buying more Bunnery Natural Foods.", "\"This sampler is no snacking lightweight. This is a hearty tasty assortment of granola (original, Cranberry-Nut-Vanilla, Banana Honey-Nut, Blueberry), PLUS (oatmeal, sunflower, millet) OSM Oatmeal and Pancake/Waffle Mix. You won't be hungry an hour later when you munch on the granola OR \"\"grazing\"\" after eating the oatmeal or Pancakes. Everything is very filling. When I made  pancakes and waffles they were hits. The guys were saying they felt like they needed to chop something down they were so energized. I was shocked at their reaction to this healthy lifestyle food which actually taste great and is well liked.IT's FANTASTIC food for the \"\"stick to the ribs\"\" season but heavy for the impending massive seasonal Texas heat. I'll be sure to have this on hand for the Fall and Winter.\"", "\"I was really excited to try this \"\"100% natural\"\" granola as my family consumes granola on a regular basis (as well as having a strong affection for Jackson Hole, WY). Following a clean diet is important to my family too. That's why I was so dissapointed to discover that all the granola varieties are made with conventional canola oil(at this time, detailed ingredients are not listed on Amazon). Approximately 90% of all canola is genetically modified (GMO). This gene splicing technique produces an organism that could never be found naturally in nature. Yes, it's a cheap, flavorless oil. I wish this company would have at least sprung for the organic canola oil option or a higher quality choice like coconut oil. I also try to avoid products that contain \"\"natural flavors\"\" as this one does, for similar reasons, including hidden GMO ingredients. As consumers, I believe, we vote with our dollars. I will not purchase this granola in the future if they continue to use engineered (un-natural) ingredients that I feel are unsafe for my family and the environment. I recommend you do your research and check out the non-gmo project.The pancake/waffle mix and oatmeal were a decent, and did not contain canola oil. I enjoyed having the easy breakfast option of those two.\"", "\"I don't typically eat granola on a daily basis because it's pretty calorie rich, and this brand is no exception.  I have been eating more granola since getting this sampler pack, though, and have appreciated the variety of flavors.  That being said, I'm not sure that I would pay a premium price for this brand of granola because it's nothing special.  I have a \"\"health food\"\" store near me with a lot of granola varieties available in bulk that have more intense flavors.I was getting ready to give this sampler pack a 3-star rating, but I finally got around to making pancakes with the waffle/pancake mix today.  I absolutely LOVED the pancakes this mix produced since it has some added texture due to the seeds and whole grains mixed in with the flour.  I didn't even add the butter the recipe calls for; I just used a little more milk to make the mix the appropriate consistency.  The pancakes were still great.I haven't looked to see if the waffle/pancake mix is available for purchase separately, but I would purchase it again.  I doubt I would buy the granola again.\"", "If you love granola/grain cereal, then this is a variety sampler pack for you. The four granola ('plain', banana-nut, cranberry-nut vanilla, blueberry) are pretty tasty in and of themselves - I was surprised by the bits of coconut that was in them, and the little hint of spice was a very nice touch. They're not as 'simple' as some other granola blends I've bought in the past, but that doesn't mean they're not relatively healthy/composed of a lot of crap fillers. Also, it's a nice grouping of different flavors, sure to please a wide range of palates.The bonus to this was the oatmeal and the pancake/waffle mix. Each one is a bit more than just the usual mixes you find out there on the market, and also come with a bit less of that 'crap filler'. They're also rather tasty as well.  All in all, there hasn't been any of this sampler pack that was a disappointment, and the small bags are nice in that it's easy to keep stuff on hand and not worry about anything going bad. You just may be disappointed if there's one item in particular that you really like.", "A nice, substantial sampler of 4 granolas, a cereal mix, and pancake mix.The natural ingredients shine through, giving the granolas good flavor. Surprisingly (since I love blueberries), the blueberry was my least favorite. Turns out that it's the only one of the 4 granolas in this set that uses brown rice syrup as its only sweetener (the others use honey, or honey and also brown rice syrup). The original and cranberry are my favorites of the four flavors.Generally, these granolas compare reasonably to the Bear Naked line (my usual preferred granola), but don't taste quite as nutty or as fresh to me. I also prefer Bear Naked's larger clusters which are easy finger-food-- the Bunnery is loose granola, and messy to eat by hand.I could also do without the pancake mix in this sampler, that seems like an odd addition to a mix of breakfast cereals.Kudos to the tasty natural product lineup. This sampler is worth trying for fans of granolas and whole grains.", "This is a very generously sized sampler box.  Each package contains enough product for several helpings, which was very nice.  You have a great chance to find out if you like the product.My favorite were the packages of the granola.  The texture was a bit different than the mass market granola I'm used to, but I soon got used to it.  The flavor was good - wholesome and not too sweet.  The Blueberry was my preference out of the four flavors.As for the oatmeal and pancake mix, they have a very hearty taste, but the texture will make this a hard sell to the little ones in your family.  Especially in the case of the pancakes, where most kids are used to a very smooth texture, this is very thick with odd lumps from the seeds and grains used.  However, the taste is very good.  If you can get your family used to a very different texture, they should enjoy this.", "\"I eat natural, whole foods like the kind in the Bunnery Natural Foods Breakfast Variety Sampler all the time, and consider myself a granola fan. Fruits, nuts, and grains are amongst my favorite foods.  I was excited to try this variety sampler and was not disappointed.The bags of granola are 12 ounces each and each bag provides several days of healthy snacking.  They have resealable tops so you can use them at your leisure.  The blueberry was my favorite flavor, with the soft and tasty granola mixture and just the right amount of dried blueberries that added great flavor.Even though I'm not a fan of many banana flavored products, I enjoyed the Honey-Nut & Banana Granola.  I love the addition of coconut.  There are also sesame seeds, almonds, dehydrated bananas and walnuts, with natural flavorings like cinnamon and cloves.The regular granola is terrific with no extra flavors or fruits, which is just fine with me, because I love granola.  Unlike many granola's, Bunnery Natural Foods granola does not have hard clusters, but instead, has delicate \"\"gatherings\"\" of product, that almost melt in your mouth.  The consistency is excellent. Very enjoyable and palatable.The pancake and waffle mix is not for everyone.  It's made with dark grains and makes a ton of pancakes that come out dark colored, no matter how long or how little you cook them.  My family is a fan of crepes, far from these pancakes, and we don't eat syrup.  While I love the pancake and waffle mix in this variety pack, my teenaged daughter didn't like it.  I wasn't surprised at all, as the product is very seedy and dark .  Every bite is full of seeds and grains to the point that chewing almost hurts your teeth.  However, I still love the product, because I love the taste and texture of whole grains, fruits and nuts.  The bag made a huge stack of pancakes and I'm eating them without toppings, syrups, sugars, or fruit, and love the taste.  You can make these pancakes and literally eat them in the car on the way to work. Just roll them up and go. I'm sure adding peanut butter would improve the taste even more, but I was happy with them plain.The oatmeal in the packet is a nice bonus as you can never have too much oatmeal if you like healthy foods.I like this product sampler a lot.  As I said, I love food like this anyway, and granola is one of my favorite snacks.  I think the price for what you receive, especially with prime shipping, is fair.  I would order this again.\"", "\"We were fortunate to receive this \"\"Bunnery Natural Foods Breakfast Variety Sampler, 5.25-Pound\"\" to evaluate for Amazon Vine.Having worked with/around natural foods for most of my adult life (managing a natural food store and running a bakery for several years, as well as practicing the lifestyle), I was especially looking forward to seeing what The Bunnery had to offer.Here's my \"\"quick-start\"\" to-the-point take on this product:Pluses (&#9650;):&#9650; all natural ingredients...ie, no added junk (*please see my elaboration below)&#9650; tasty: all samples were flavorful, not too sweet, with just the right 'crunch'&#9650; nice texture...crisp, not too chunky, not pulverized&#9650; sweetened with honey and/or brown rice syrup, not dextrose or HFCS&#9650; the 'OSM' (stands for oats/sunflower seeds/millet) is a nice  grain combo&#9650; nice packaging, with easy strip-open and resealMinuses (&#9660;):&#9660; listed 'canola oil' ingredient implies it's probably not cold-pressed&#9660; some products list 'natural flavor'...not sure what they are, exactly&#9660; prefer to see listed 'all purpose flour' replaced with stone ground&#9660; pancake mix is a bit too rough (cracked grains could be a bit smaller)We really liked the granola...the 'original' especially evoked memories of my mother's home-made batches she made for me back in the 1970's.The pancake/waffle mix had to compete with my own 7-grain mix that I make every Sunday...and all testers found it a tad too gritty (a little more grinding would solve that). I recommend using buttermilk instead of regular milk when preparing the mix.*Now...just to elaborate on the 'natural' aspect. As many have noted, it is an overused term that has very little real meaning today. Even 'organic' is, at best, just a hopeful guide. But, at least one can infer that chemicals are not being used. However, my antennae go up when I read 'natural flavors' and 'all purpose flour.' I would urge The Bunnery to tighten up their ingredients so they can offer/claim cold-pressed oil and stone ground grains, as well as be more specific in defining the 'flavors' used.Having said all of the above, overall, I'd recommend buying and trying...it's a nice assortment and worthy of being experienced!\"", "\"I don't know how many times I have bought foods labeled \"\"natural\"\" only to have SWMBO read over the label and tell me I had been taken.  She is very particular and I expected the same response here- but no!This stuff really is natural. There are no preservatives, no pesticides added to the packing, no anything that she found objectionable.  It really is natural.The products are packaged in resealable plastic bags- probably why they can get away without the additives.  It also makes it convenient to use and store between uses.So far I have only tried a couple of flavors.  I find the texture good, and the taste good as well.  I would prefer it a bit sweeter- but I have a real sweet tooth.  SWMBO says they taste exactly as they should.All in all its good to see a product that is exactly what it says it is.  Hats off to Bunnery Natural foods.(Note; as far as I can find, they don't claim to be \"\"organically grown\"\" if that is important to you.\"", "This very generous sampler package of breakfast foods. The granola is delicious not too sweet and not too much much fat. It is nice granola for putting into yogurt because it has fruit in it.The pancake mix is a bit grainy so I let it sit for 30 minutes to soften, before cooking. I don't really like oatmeal but I will use it to make cookies.I had not heard of Bunnery granola before, I used Bare Naked but Bunnery is just as good. Highly recommend.", "My wife and I absolutely devoured these! Everything in this sampler is fantastic! Each different type of granola has just the right amount of fruit and nuts. I ate mine with almond milk; my wife mixed hers with yogurt. I had a difficult time just eating one bowl per sitting. Not only is this great for breakfast, but for a snack or substitute lunch or dinner. Some of the ingredients you will find in the granola varieties include banana chips, cranberries, blueberries, sesame seeds, sunflower seeds, almonds, walnuts and coconut.The pancake mix was also phenomenal! They are full of oats, cracked wheat, sunflower seeds, millet and wheat bran. I've never eaten pancakes this good or this healthy. We also liked the oatmeal, but it is much better if you add Craisins or some other fruit to zing it up a bit.We are sold on this product! While a little pricey, it's worth it, in my opinion. Not only are you getting a great tasting treat, but a very healthy one as well.", "I like everything in this sampler!  The granola is crunchy and great on plain yogurt!  The pancake/waffle mix is easy to use and has a nice fluffy texture in either pancake or waffle form.  And the hot cereal, well, I like pretty much all hot cereals, so I'm an easy judge when it comes to those.  I liked the texture of this one, and it kept me full for a good while (in a good way, not the I-feel-like-I-ate-a-grain-mill way).Nice packaging too with re-closing and sturdy bags; I didn't feel the need to transfer package contents to anything else to preserve freshness or keep visitors out.Overall, I'm a fan!  These are products I'll seek out again.", "\"I'm a hard sell on \"\"healthy\"\" products like this because mostly I find that they're dry and tasteless, suitable more for the mortification of the flesh than actual, y'know, dining.  Bunnery seems to have avoided the trap of making healthy food that tastes like cardboard with four really, really tasty granolas, one hot cereal and a pancake/waffle mix all of which are not just good for you but actually good to eat!  I know, right?  Who knew it could be done?The granolas are not very sweet, so if you're a big fan of sugary breakfasts, don't even bother.  My favorite so far is the cranberry-nut which has a very distinct tang from the cranberries.  Really tasty.  Pancakes are nice and fluffy, and have a good flavor.  Oatmeal... well I'm not a fan of rolled oats; I prefer steel cut.  This stuff is fine; it has millet and sunflower seeds which does tend to make it a little less glue-y.The only thing I don't like -- and this cost them a star -- is the price.  At a bit over $5 a bag, this is premium priced breakfast food.  Purchased singly, they're even pricier.  It just seems to me that the world would be a much nicer place if everyone could afford really good food like this.  But as it is, I won't be able to continue buying these granolas, so it's back to making my own.  If you can justify the expense, by all means buy them.  They're that good.\"", "I had never heard of Bunnery Natural Foods before and was glad I had an opportunity to sample a full range of their granola products through this generously-sized sampler.In this set, you receive five thick, heavy pouches of their granola, each one marked by a different color, and a pancake/waffle mix. Each pouch is about the size of a typical potato chip bag but filled densely with product. All of the pouches are ziploc which means you can open and then re-seal to preserve the fresh flavor.The portions for each flavor are generous. Each pouch easily offers more than 5 servings and I expect the set to last me about six months, since I prefer to sprinkle granola into my yogurt rather than eat it by itself.I love blueberry, so I tried the Blueberry Granola sprinkled into my vanilla yogurt first. Delicious! The blueberry flavor was strong without being too sweet, just the way I like it. I then tried the Cranberry - this was even better than the blueberry, I liked the crunchy texture, the fresh taste of the cranberry and the subtle sweetness. The banana granola was also pleasant, not my favorite flavor but then I prefer the taste of berries.The regular granola didn't appeal to me as much as I like flavored granola. Next stop, the waffle/pancake mix! I haven't done this yet but plan to do so soon (and will update my review accordingly). Right now I'm working my way through the granolas, and enjoying every minute of it. Everything I sampled so far tastes healthy, rich and satisfying, and I probably end up buying more.One more thing - I have to say, for the price and what you get, I think this set would be a great item to give as a gift - I've rarely came across a sampler that offered so much product, and for slightly more than $30!", "\"Bunnery Natural Foods Breakfast Variety Sampler is just a big box of YUM! I've never had granola as good as the ones in this sampler. All of the granola selections were really good with a great balance of ingredients so each bite was a good as the last one. What I love about granola is how it's great for breakfast or as a snack throughout the day.Pancake and Waffle mix made delicious pancakes and waffles that didn't taste like \"\"good for you\"\" food. They tasted so good it tricked my mind into thinking it was bad for me!I really enjoyed the oatmeal too but would have liked some directions on how much water or milk and how much oatmeal. I've been using 1 cup of milk to 1/2 cup of oatmeal and that seems to work for me.All of these products are filling and get your day started off on the right foot.\"", "\"This is a big box of a LOT of food for the money. These products could easily be ten dollars each which makes the currently pricing about half of that DELIVERED!You get a full bag of four kinds of granola--Original, Banana, Blueberry and Cranberry.And then a bag of \"\"rough\"\" oatmeal and \"\"rough\"\" pancake mix.Overall the granola is good but not my favorite--I prefer local fresh granola over the drier kind and Bear Naked as a national brand over this generally. The blueberry was my least favorite with an odd taste at the end. Banana and Original were my favorites.The oatmeal was ok...I am not a huge oatmeal fan but it was good for occasional servings...I do not think I would want it every day as that would take something away from the special nature of it.Which is how the pancake/waffle mix is as well. It worked much better for pancakes and I actually REALLY enjoyed the added texture in the pancakes but if this was your go-to mix it would lose that specialness. Use it with some good real maple syrup to have an added \"\"special\"\" feeling to it. The texture seemed odd in waffles.Overall this box makes a great care package or cheer up gift--even if it is for you. :) It brings a slightly different feel into your kitchen and makes you feel you are out in a cabin in the mountains...if you just close your eyes.\"", "\"The Bunnery \"\"Natural Foods for Healthy Lifestyles\"\" include four different granola products, plus oatmeal and pancake/waffle mix. Having given all of them a fair trial, I present the following review.Bunnery Granolas have a delicious taste and agreeable consistency. I give each of them five stars.The three fruited granola products consist mainly of the Original Granola plus dried fruit.The taste and texture of the Original granola was the best of the four Bunnery products. The Blueberry and Cranberry-Nut granolas were generally pretty good (my wife really liked them) although I would prefer adding my own fresh fruit instead of the chewy dried fruit used in these varieties. The Banana Honey-Nut Granola had too much of an artificial taste for my liking.The Bunnery Oatmeal included cracked wheat, wheat bran, millet and sunflower seeds in addition to oatmeal, which gave the cereal a lumpy consistency and an uneven taste. The pancakes and waffles were extremely heavy and difficult to chew and digest, in addition to being extraordinarily dry. I give both of these products one star.Although I found the Bunnery granola products to be very good, I have difficulty justifying paying half again as much more than I pay for Bear Naked Fruit and Nut Granola in our local grocery store. For the sake of variety, however, I plan to purchase more of the Bunnery Original Granola even though it is more expensive.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.035472143441438675, 0.03345185145735741, 0.02802337519824505, 0.02589486725628376, 0.030794136226177216, 0.034285273402929306, 0.03330141678452492, 0.03338407725095749, 0.034768979996442795, 0.03154612332582474, 0.030938275158405304, 0.033872343599796295, 0.029281584545969963, 0.03204045817255974, 0.02535293810069561, 0.027516860514879227, 0.03132534399628639, 0.034588977694511414, 0.029987722635269165, 0.027227917686104774, 0.03226824104785919, 0.03727313503623009, 0.02335738204419613, 0.030221495777368546, 0.03267724812030792, 0.027866564691066742, 0.034292202442884445, 0.031206386163830757, 0.029300343245267868, 0.03606998175382614, 0.03280993178486824, 0.02960239164531231]]}
