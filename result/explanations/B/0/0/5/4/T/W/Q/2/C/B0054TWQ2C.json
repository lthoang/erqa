"], "reviews": ["Sure, it's unhealthy, but if you are expecting to eat Ramen you won't be disappointed.I rarely eat these noodle bowls, but when I ate this one I was pleasantly surprised by the spiciness of the broth.  You usually never get that --you know, where they say 'spicy' but it really is just spicy to middle America, not those used to eating Thai or Indian food.In this case, it is just spicy enough.  You start to sweat a tiny bit, but it doesn't burn your mouth.Would I buy this regularly? Probably not, it isn't healthy enough, but would I buy one or two of these to stick in my office cabinet in case I have to work late and haven't made alternate dinner plans? Sure I would.Tasty enough, no Msg, lower sodium (probably because it has the added spiciness to counteract) and a good enough taste.", "\"These are just ramen noodles in a convenient microwavable cup. Noodles, a smattering of dried veggies and TVP, and a salt...I mean flavor packet. Prep is stupid easy...open the foil lid, add the contents of the flavor packet, add water to the line, fold the lid back down, nuke for three minutes, stir, and enjoy.The results are just what you would expect from a bowl of ramen. Lots of noodles and broth, and there at the bottom of the bowl, are a few vegetable bits and some tiny cubes of textured soy protein that is supposed to pass for chicken. The flavor is just about what you would expect from a chicken flavored soup, but with a nice spicy kick on the back of the throat. That spiciness stays pleasantly on the lips for a few minutes after.So what's not to like? Even if you aren't watching your sodium intake, this is a salt lick in a bowl. Even if you follow the \"\"serving guidelines\"\" on the nutrition facts panel and share this with a friend or loved one (Yeah, right!), you get over one third of your daily salt intake. If you are like most of us and hog all 3 oz. yourself, your sodium intake will be a whopping 74% of the daily recommended maximum.The price is also a bit steep for a ramen product. Overall it is not enough new and different from the ramen in the cello wrap for me to purchase this.\"", "These 'ramen-like' noodles will be a tasty addition to anyone's lunch repertoire - providing of course you have a microwave handy at the office\\shop.  The 'Spicy Chicken Flavor' lives up to it's name.  These noodles bite back!  :)  ((But nothing too bad))  I have a love of all things spicy -- but I found these to be somewhere in the low to middle range of heat\\spice.  Each bowl contains 2 servings - bringing the total calorie count to 380 per bowl (Total Fat = 7g, Cholesterol = 0mg, Sodium = 890mg, Total Carb = 28g, Protein = 4g).  The package is used as the bowl.  You peel back the lid, and add room temperature water to the easily seen line - then microwave for 3 min.  Or you add hot water and wait 3 minutes.  There were a few small chunks of chicken - ideally I would want more.  The packaging indicates it has 30% less sodium - but at 890mg of sodium I would hate to see that extra 30% back.", "I used the full packet of seasoning mix and I though the broth had much more depth of flavor than most noodle cup type meals with distinguishable notes of lemongrass and ginger. I would rate the heat level at medium with a pleasant tingly mouth burn. Less salty but still plenty of sodium, there is plenty of broth so this would be a good one to use as a base with added vegetables and meat. Weak points are the dehydrated chicken and vegetables that have a distinctive dehydrated flavor.", "I love pork noodles at the Chinese restaurant, now they are getting hard to find on the menu.  I was having a cup of noodles on rare occasion to satisfy my noodle urges, they are not too satisfying.  Just tried a bowl of the Nong Shim Spicy Chicken, must say they are a major improvement over the ones that I have previously bought.  These actually have flavor and are quite satisfying.  The serving size is generous and is plenty for a quick lunch.  At about a dollar a bowl, a very reasonable meal.  Compared to the ones that I have had in a restaurant, fresh would naturally be my preference.  I can say that I do like these and I will purchase more.  Great item to have in reserve for lunch at work and when you just don't feel like cooking.", "\"I've been eating Nong Shim's noodles for years -- I particularly like eating their Spicy Seafood udon-style noodles (not 'instant' stuff like this).  Their products usually deliver on lots of flavor and a decent textured noodles.  This Spicy Chicken flavor bowl of noodle soup would be the first instant variety of their noodles I've tried.The quality/texture of the noodles is similar to that of the Nissin brand noodles (better than Maruchan).  What sets this apart is the soup base flavor pack which delivers a more complex flavor and IMO tastes much better by comparison.  Since they give you the soup base pack, it gives you the option to add as much or as little flavoring as you'd like (whereas Cup O' Noodles, you're usually stuck with however much they give you).  It has the usual dehydrated veggies.  Other reviewers mention that there are little chunks of chicken... Reading the ingredients, I don't see a single mention of chicken besides chicken broth.Whereas the typical Cup o' Noodle will deliver 2.25-oz of unhealthy goodness, these bowls of noodle delivers 3.03oz.  The bowl of noodles wasn't that filling -- it'd be a perfect sized snack.  I don't know how they would conclude that this bowl would be equivalent to 2 servings.  The bowl delivers 380 calories (120 from fat), 14g of fat, 6g of saturated fat, 1780 mg of sodium, 56g of carbs, 2g of dietary fiber, and upwards of 2g of sugar, and 8g of protein.On the packaging, it seems NongShim is trying to sell you on the product being healthy.  It touts \"\"No MSG added,\"\" \"\"30% less sodium than our regular product,\"\" \"\"0g trans fat.\"\"  It has received some \"\"2011 Chef's Best Award\"\" and is \"\"Endorsed by Professional Chefs.\"\"  Really?If you're buying this, don't expect this to be your answer to a healthy diet.  That said, if all you want is a quick and tasty snack, then NongShim will deliver what you're looking for.\"", "This afternoon I had a Nongshim Bowl Noodle Soup of the Spicy Chicken variety. It's a quick lunch (four minutes) and quite tasty. My only gripes would be that it's too high in sodium, a complaint shared by almost all noodle bowls, and that it doesn't have enough protein for a good meal. I can easily add the latter. I also had a big Delicious Apple to supply something fresh and something with a lot of fiber. Altogether, the combination made a good lunch, and it was quick and easy.Gary Peterson", "\"This is no better. . . and no worse than ramen noodles you can pick-up in the store for a LOT less $$.Pro's:Comes in in a bowl, so it's easyNo MSG (but plenty of other \"\"stuff\"\" like Gum Arabic, Malic Acid, Maltodextrin, Disodium Guanylate, Disodium Inosinate, Disodium Succinate, etc.)Con's:CostDon't let the picture fool you.

Zilch.\"", "\"\"\"Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl\"\" was another Amazon Vine sample that one of the kids snatched up and ate before I could properly review it.  So you'll have to be happy with this second-hand report.  Anyway, my daughter was the one who grabbed this particular product up (as opposed to my son, who nabbed the \"\"Chips Ahoy!\"\" cookies).  Not a girl of many words (at least not with the parents, generally) she said that she microwaved it, and that it was delicious.  I did manage to pry out of her that she had no special difficulty in preparing it (\"\"it was easy!\"\").  So there you have it-- if our frequently picky daughter enjoyed this, it must be at least pretty good, right?\"", "First off, as of this writing, this product is not actually for sale on this page. But it is for sale here: [...]Just had a bowl of these for lunch. I'm not a huge eater, and found the volume of this to be okay. I'm glad I brought some corn chips to supplement (I know, not the best combo). The taste was okay too, though not, in my mind, much better than most ramen or Cup o Noodles or Maruchan type things. Really, it was like a squirt of sriracha in a cup of chicken ramen. Which is fine. Good. And this doesn't have MSG, so that's nice, and it comes in a bowl, so that's nice. There are flakes of veggies, and a couple pea-sized chunks of very spongy chicken. It took me a while to realize that the spongy stuff was chicken. Seems about right for this kind of product.I can't leave the office for lunch, so I'm always looking for something I can tuck in a desk drawer and actually enjoy. Given that it is in a microwaveable (non-styrofoam) bowl, and I like the idea of squirting sriracha in my ramen, this is a good option. Given how infrequently I'll use them, though, I might splurge and go for a much more expensive but slightly more gourmet bowl of noodles (Annie Chun, etc). On the other hand, if I were going to eat them more frequently, I might want to splurge and go for a more expensive but healthier alternative.If cheap, easy, and basically tasty are your priorities, this is probably a good option. If you want to throw healthy or interesting into the mix, I think you're going to have to spend a little more.", "Nong Shim's Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl offers up a quick, Ramen-style noodle dish that comes in a one-serving bowl.  Like Cup-A-Noodle and other Ramen-type meals, this is basically a fast, reasonably tasty meal for people who are working at the office or just want something really quick at home.  Just open the lid halfway, fill with water to the internal line, throw in the seasonings from the enclosed packet, nuke it for few minutes and enjoy.As far as taste is concerned, Nong Shim has done nothing to separate itself from the noodle pack.  If you've had spicy chicken flavored noodles from other companies, you've pretty much had Nong Shim's version of the dish.I like eating noodles in this fashion whenever I'm by myself at home and can't decide what to eat for lunch.  They are quick, taste good enough, and basically prevent me from eating a bunch of junk food.I recommend Nong Shim's Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowl to anyone who's tied down at work or just hungry for something fast.", "\"One bowl (2 servings) makes a filling lunch for one.  The highly spiced chicken flavoring (definitely not for wimps!) is quite tasty.  The extra-long, curly noodles are delicious.  There are no vegetable or chicken bits in the bowl--the ones shown on the package label are apparently garnishes added for the photo shoot.  The ingredients list reveals more beef flavorings than chicken flavorings.The food prep couldn't be easier: (1) pull back the cover, (2) open the seasonings packet and dump it in, (3) fill the bowl with room temperature water, (4) microwave for 3 minutes, and (5) let cool for at least one minute before eating.  One is wise to heed the instructions to wait a bit before eating--my microwaved noodles were still too hot to eat after three or four minutes.  The bowl can also be prepared by adding hot water and letting the mixture steep for three minutes.Unfortunately,  the 2-serving bowl--and who eats only half a bowl of noodles?--delivers a whopping 1780 mg of sodium, even though this particular product has 30% less sodium than the manufacturer's regular product.  The FDA recommended daily intake for sodium is about 2300 mg of sodium, so if you eat the whole bowl, you have consumed about 77% of your day's recommended sodium.  (The package label is reasonably honest, stating that 1 serving delivers 37% of your daily sodium.)Because my diet is generally a low-salt one (by choice, not for medical reasons), I could tell that some of the spicy flavor was coming from salt rather than from other seasonings.  However, the product did not make me immediately thirsty, as most high-salt commercial food products do.  For me, this product is worth only three stars (\"\"it's okay\"\"), because I can't eat it on a regular basis and still keep my salt intake down.  That's too bad, because a product like this is great to have on the pantry shelf to pull out for a quick meal.\"", "Ramen cups (or bowls, in this case) are a guilty pleasure. I enjoy a Nissin or a Maruchan from time to time, but I know before adding the water that I'm not going to get a healthful snack. For that reason, I don't assess any star penalty for the nutritional transgressions that will be committed when one of these is consumed. They are what they are. You want healthy, eat a salad.Speaking of healthy, the Nongshim bowl proudly proclaims that it has 30% less sodium than their regular product and no MSG. But if you eat the whole thing you'll still be getting about 3/4 of your daily allotment of sodium (assuming a 2000 calorie diet) as well as artificial flavor and the usual cast of chemical names. As I mentioned, you would assume this much unless you just fell off a potato truck.All that said, I just didn't care for the Nongshim very much. I like spicy but I didn't find it all that flavorful beyond the spice heat. My 3-star rating is based solely on that. If sodium and healthy eating are concerns, you can work your way down the star scale from there.", "\"This cup-o-noodles knock off is fine tasting. It is not as aggressively hot as some Korean foods. I would call it mild to medium-minus in the spiciness arena. It has instructions for both microwave and \"\"Add boiling water\"\" methods of preparation. The one reason I would take off a star is that the picture on the top implies wholesome chunks of chicken and veggies. What you get are noodles that look like the noodles. Broth looks similar, too. The meat and veggie particles are tiny, 6mm chunks. You really won't have to sharpen the teeth for this stuff because the meat is so small.I am sure that there is some fine print saying it's a serving suggestion and you should add your chunks of meat and vegetables, but given that, they should have just not attempted to put the tiny freeze dried pellets in there. One of those things that highlights the issue.\"", "This is a dried noodle soup that you put the seasoning in the noodles then either put water in it and microwave for three minutes or pour boiling water over it and wait for a few moments.The flavor was spicy chicken and I admit that I felt a little of the warmth from the spices, but didn't really taste the chicken flavor. I did like that there was green onions in with the seasoning. This was better than the usual peas and carrots that are on the top of a Cup O Noodles.I didn't like the bowl that the soup came in. When it had hot water in it, it became really flimsy. I was afraid that the edge was going to cave in and I would get burned from the hot water.In the end, this was basically a Cup O Noodles soup. It tasted just like a Cup O Noodles except that they seasoning package was separate and you had to pour that into the soup before messing with water.At the moment, Amazon does not have a price listed for these so I don't know how cost effective they would be. In my opinion, I would say that the noodle soup was good and filling but take a look at the Cup O Noodles selection before deciding if you really need to order the soup from Amazon.Shawn KovacichAuthor of the Achieving Kicking Excellence book and DVD series.", "These noodles are worth the extra $ over the cheap ones. They taste less chemically and salty and have a firmer texture. Size of package is just right too. I prefer the spicy varieties. They add a little kick, but don't make you burn.", "I've been buying the Nong Shim Spicy Chicken Noodle Bowls for over a year now. They are really great when you want something warm and quick. I like that the flavor is in a packet so you can add as much or as little of it as you want. The flavor of them is also good for something that is an instant noodle. I have tried other brands of instant noodles and they just don't have the taste that these do. Most other ones are more bland and just not very good.
