These fallen Angels have taken shelter on Earth, creating a veil, or false sky, to hide from God, the humans who once prayed to God saw they Angels as gods as well and began praying to them, eventually forgetting their true God. Since these people are praying to these false gods who have been corrupted by 'The Darkness', they do not ascend to Heaven when they die and instead become creatures of darkness themselves.GraphicsIf you ask anyone what stands out the most in El Shaddai, they'll say one of two things, the anime-like art style, or the remarkably amazing visuals (hopefully the latter). El Shaddai makes up for the lack of story with graphics that will leave you mesmerized, the coloring and lighting are done EXTREMELY well and make everything pop. The changing color scheme, which happens often, makes things come alive to a leel I have never honestly seen in gaming.Normally, graphics are nothing special and remain unchanged from one game to another or differ slightly, in El Shaddai they are breathtaking and stunning, while they aren't realistic, they are some of the best (if not the best) artistic graphics I've ever seen.ControlsThe controls are rather simple to grasp, but can be tough to master. You have your standard jump, attack and guard buttons (A, X/Y and RB respectively), as well as a purification button (LB) which allows you to purify, or clean, your weapons as they get 'dirty' from attacking enemies. While they are rather basic, the timing is critical, a block at the right moment can send the enemy reeling, allowing for Enoch to follow up with a series of blows, attacking at the right moment has the same effect.I mentioned Purification  you must purify your weapon regularly as it builds up darkness gained from enemies, if you don't purify, your weapon will inflict less damage and have a reduced chance of staggering the enemy, so you should really purify after every battle.Music/Sound/VoiceThere is little music generally, it is rather quite and almost harmonic with everything else that is going on in game, you can hear it but it will not stand out on most occasions. Somehow, this works well with the games settings, so I personally didn't mind the ambiance it brought.Sound is done much tot he same effect, you'll hear somethings on some levels and nothing on others, these can be as simple wind blowing or fireworks going off, small things that add to the games ambiance.Voicing is done very well for an anime styled game, which are usually quite over-dramatic, granted there's very little talking outside of confrontation or narration, but what little there is is done quite nicely.OtherOne of the negatives, or positives, depending on how you look at it,  is the fact that there are only 3 weapons in the game, the Arch, the Gale and the Veil (you can also use your fists, so technically 4). Each has their pros and cons, they are sort of like rock-paper-scissors, one beats the other which loses to a different one.The Arch - A bow like weapon that is really a sword, the bow stings are sharp blades. The Arch is an all-around average weapon, average strength, speed and recoil.The Gale - A series of shard like crystals that can be hurled at enemies and easily linked together. The Gale is very fast but also very weak and causes little recoil.The Veil - A giant shield, broken in half allowing Enoch to easily wield it. The Veil has the best physical and defensive capabilities, causing recoil at a high rate, it is very slow however.Once you've beaten the game, you can play through it again with extras such as outfits, higher difficulties and you are also graded in each level and leaderboard ranking.OverallEl Shaddai is a rather unique game for both it's reference to real religious texts and for its amazing art, any fan of action/hack and slash titles should check this out.8.5/10.0Pros- STUNNING visuals- Simple, yet complex combat- Interesting real life referenceCons- Limited weapons- After you've mastered combat it's very easy- Story takes awhile to take offSee the complete review at lvgrb.blogspot", "I will admit that some of the visuals in this game are amazing, and the story is slightly interesting. However, the gameplay is extremely generic, repetitive, and annoying. It's really just a button masher, without any room for creativity or strategy in your playstyle. I also didn't like how there was no way to improve your weapons and armor. Then, each of the weapons have some good and bad things about them, and if you were able to use them interchangeably they would really benefit each other. However, you only have access to one of them at a time, and for most of the game you can only change weapons by disarming/cleansing the enemy. The other biggest problem for me, was the way the game uses extra lives. When you run out of health (which is coolly shown by losing your armor/clothing) you have to mash your buttons to wake back up, however there is a limit to this and each time it's harder to wake back up. This inevitably ends with you dying, and the game then lectures you about how to stay alive by mashing the buttons even though that was just what you were doing, and you have to revert to the last save/checkpoint which at times can be way far back, there's also incredibly long load times. For the platforming, it's very basic, and it's pretty floaty and many times hard to be accurate, especially when holes in the world blend in with the environment. I probably would have enjoyed the game more if I chose Easy instead of normal (as the worst problems may not have occurred as frequently) but once you choose at the very beginning of the game you can never change it for some reason.In the end, I would definitely not recommend this game, but some people could possibly find a good game here if you could overlook all of the faults, something that I couldn't do.", "think bayonetta's easiest mode and you have basically what el shaddai offers easy and repetitive combat with stunning visuals and breathtaking music, i reccomend it as a rental.", "Funny but I did not enjoy the DEMO! I only bought it because I was interested in the story and the game is so cheap. The combat is surprisingly deep, If you play it at normal you will quickly find out you cannot button mash your way through this game, like to box says the combat is easy to play but hard to master! Last time a game forced me to discipline myself I was playing ninja gaiden black.", "I'm a fan of many different kinds of games, and usually go out of the way to find lesser known but acclaimed titles (I loved Enslaved for the 360). I saw enough positive reviews about this game to pick it up.I wasn't initially disappointed, but the story for this game is so abstract and confusing that I was lost interest- and fast. The battles were fun, but there were many points in the game that were scripted (Wait, I was supposed to lose? Then why did I just fight this guy for 5 minutes?) that took me out of the game.Apparently I was somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 of the game when I gave up. The levels were interesting, but it ended up just being too weird.", "\"We often see the debate rage on about whether games are truly art or not, but rarely do we ask the question: what sort of game would an artist make? El Shaddai would be that answer. You see, the game's director, Sawaki Takeyasu, who was in charge of the game's overall development, has only worked as an artist and even art director for past games he has worked on. Two of them,OkamiandViewtiful Joe, are considered some of the most beautiful and stylistic games ever made. He was also art director forDevil May Cry. His artistic focus, as well as the entire creative teams' purposefully artful approach, is evident throughout the entire game. This game has had a somewhat polarizing effect in the press (Game Informer: 9/10, Gamepro: 4.5/5, IGN: 5/10), with reviews being either universal praise or lots of (undue) criticism. Yes, you need to know what you're getting into when you pop in El Shaddai, a masterfully crafted experience that is meant to immerse and move you.For me personally, I can already tell you after a bit of time with the game, this game should be bought and bought new to encourage the market to make more products as breathtaking and refreshing as this. It is an exceptional masterpiece that you will never forget, a truly amazing experience. Games this unique and beautiful are extremely rare and El Shaddai ranks among the very best of artistic games. Games likeOkami,Viewtiful Joe,Muramasa: The Demon Blade,Odin Sphere, and a few others come to mind. The publishers and developers of El Shaddai need to be rewarded for taking such a huge business risk by putting out a piece of art very different from the 1,001 desaturated shooters that flood the market each year. Also, by buying these sorts of games new, we can show the publishers that we do love beautiful, artistic games, and maybe they'll start making games of this caliber more often than every couple of years or so. With that out of the way, here's some information to help you know what you're getting into with the game. I will keep it all spoiler free. This game is full of amazing surprises that need to be experienced first-hand.El Shaddai is based on the ancient Hebrew text, theBook of Enoch, found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Anyone who knows a bit about their Biblical history knows that Enoch was a prophet that was active some time before the fabled flood of Noah. The story of his book, and this game, is that he is sent to \"\"cleanse\"\" the souls of fallen angels, called \"\"Watchers,\"\" whose job had been to watch over mankind. They however, grew obsessed with humanity, took women as their own wives, birthed monsters called Nephilim, and now lived among people, corrupting God's divine purpose. It's a fascinating story subject for a game, and the fact that it is a traditionally western scriptural text being interpreted by distinctly Eastern, Japanese sensibilities makes it even more interesting. The characters are fascinating and while the distinct quirkiness of Japanese game design are here (although I wouldn't really go as far as to call it \"\"anime style\"\" per say), it's all a very refreshing experience. As Enoch, you will ascend a massive tower, each floor of which is an entire world devoted to each angel, and that's where the art comes in.You see, each Watcher became obsessed with a different aspect of mankind, and offered their own unique \"\"gift\"\" to mankind as well. This translates to each Watcher's floor being completely unique in its art design. They're all striking and totally unique. In this game, you will transverse entire worlds that range from ever-shifting water color paintings, a world seemingly pulled from a minimalists' abstract painting in a modern art gallery, an organically rendered world, and even a hi-tech city very reminiscent ofTron: Legacy(Cycle sequence and all). I'll stop there because I really don't want to give anything away, as this game is spectacular when you discover for the first time what it has to offer. The enemy designs all fit their respective environments, and are pretty bizarre and interesting. Actually, all of the character designs are very striking, and some are very strange. Enoch himself is shirtless prophet in designer jeans, with white armor pieces that look like porcelain attached to him to indicate his health level. Archangels wearing black skinny jeans, while talking nonsense (at first anyway) on a cell phone? Yeeeeah, El Shaddai is kind of out there on its own in the world, but that is partly what makes it so spectacular. I really cannot praise the art direction in this game enough. It is one of the most varied, unique, and downright beautifully designed games in terms of art that I have seen sinceOkami, and I sincerely mean that.The music cannot go unmentioned either. Composed by Masato Koda, who also wrote the music for the Devil May Cry series, this soundtrack is awesome. This game features music from all over the spectrum, ranging from levitical choirs, to Japanese garden zen-like music with harps and other traditional Japanese instruments, to 1970's jazzy-disco, to majestic Post-Rock. It's all here, and it's all quite excellent. I love it.The gameplay is probably the most polarizing aspect of El Shaddai, and I can understand why (rhyme unintentional). At its core, El Shaddai is a 3rd person action adventure platformer with lots of beat-em-up moments. This is very well executed. However, this game takes another artistic school of thought and applies it straight to the gameplay. That concept is minimalism. You see, there is no HUD at all in the game. The combat is much more oriented on having encounters with only a couple enemies, with a focus on flow and elegance. Even the non-combat gameplay mechanics are very simple that use few buttons, but are executed elegantly. In fact, \"\"elegance\"\" is the word I would use to describe the gameplay in El Shaddai. This is intentional, and it is done with a purpose. Some in the gaming press have missed that and therefore given the review some poor ratings. Some will hate the gameplay, it's to be expected when it is so deliberately focused on being artistic in its execution and flow. You need to know that going in. Personally, I found it refreshing and very enjoyable, all of it.Really, whether you enjoy the game or not will really boil down to whether you are in the right mindset to play the game. If you understand that this game, in every single possible way conceivable, is meant to actually stand as an immersive, beautiful work of art, you will absolutely love El Shaddai with your whole soul. Chances are, if you're looking at this obscure game at all, then you will be the type to love it. It is a niche title, that will probably grow to having a very devoted underground following (I truly hope it transcends an underground, cult status though). Personally, I fall in that category, and I am so refreshed after playing El Shaddai. It is a beautiful work of art, poignant and affecting, and I really hope that we get either a direct sequel, or at least a spiritual successor, soon. I said this earlier, but I must reiterate: BUY THIS GAME AND BUY IT NEW! Buy it, immerse yourself into it, and be transported to a magical world where games truly can be masterful works of art!*As I continue my way through the game, I'll post updates to my review if I feel there is anything important to add to what is here in this review. For now, though, I think this review pretty much sums up the game in a spoiler-free yet informative fashion. I hope it was helpful. Thank you and good day! :)\"", "flat out, this game has alot going for it, but the target audience wasnt what it was expected. that being said, this game is fun and inventive with few elements of religious belief. good story, a bit confusing at start"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.16777582466602325, 0.04210760444402695, 0.1666831523180008, 0.01001543365418911, 0.14369098842144012, 0.2800782024860382, 0.18964876234531403]]}
