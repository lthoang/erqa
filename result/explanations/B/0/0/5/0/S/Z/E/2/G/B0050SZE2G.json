Unfortunately the islands are also in a state of civil war, with the native Rakyat tribe battling pirates and drug-runners who have taken over the area. The Americans are taken prisoner by the pirates, but Jason Brody manages to escape and find sanctuary amongst the Rakyat. He is trained in the ways of war, but as he seeks out his friends and tries to take down the pirate leader, Vaas, he risks losing his soul as the violence and conflict intensifies.Far Cry 3 is the third title in the Far Cry franchise, though it is not a true sequel. It does not share any story or character elements with its two predecessors and can be played fully independently of them. What it does share is the same ethos: a dedication to providing a story-driven single-player experience within a sandbox environment, giving the player immense freedom in deciding how to proceed.Far Cry 2 was heavily criticised for featuring a similar approach, but not doing enough with it. The game's annoyances - almost non-existent characterisation and of course the frequent road checkpoints with near-instantly respawning enemies which made travel across the map excruciatingly frustrating - overwhelmed the game's conceptual strong points, such as its 'buddy' NPC system and rich atmosphere. The designers of Far Cry 3 seem to have borne the previous title's problems in mind and provided a counter for every one of them whilst reinforcing those elements that did work. In short, Far Cry 3 finally fulfils the potential its predecessor squandered, and redeems the franchise.The game employs a number of different systems which work in tandem to make it more engrossing for the player. There's a campaign story which you can follow, in which Brody rescues his friends one-by-one before trying to kill Vaas and his ally, the drug-runner Hoyt. However, at the start of the game Brody is a nobody with no combat training and no ability to carry lots of guns around. To improve your chances of survival, you can undertake training missions for the Rakyat or go hunting animals to improve your aim. Skinning these animals also allows you to craft holders, bandoliers and backpacks, allowing you to carry more ammo and gear. However, your map at the start of the game is almost devoid of any useful information: to open up more map information, you have to ascend radio towers and download information from them. Travelling around the islands is also hazardous due to enemy checkpoints and strongholds. To reduce the number of enemies roaming the islands, taking out these outposts is essential. Unlike Far Cry 2's instantly-respawning bases, however, the outposts in Far Cry 3 stay cleared once cleared. In fact, Rakyat forces soon show up and these outposts become havens for resupply and re-equipping between missions. Outposts also generate their own missions, with side-quests, further hunting challenges and assassination assignments becoming available.In short, there is rarely a lack of something to do in Far Cry 3. It's up to you whether you pursue the single-player storyline to the exclusion of everything else, or put it on hold whilst clearing up all the side-quests first, or (more satisfyingly) mix and match as you proceed. There are whiffs of the Elder Scrolls and GTA series in the game's freeform structure, with the same potential for unintentional dark comedy: laying down a minefield to trap  unwary enemies only for the mines to be detonated by a wayward crocodile, or standing triumphant at the entrance to a freshly-liberated outpost only to be run over by a jeep carrying your over-exuberant allies. The game's addition of upgradeable skills and experience points continues the franchise's evolution into a pseudo-RPG, whilst it is a huge improvement over both its predecessors due to its much stronger characters. I can't remember the name of a single NPC from Far Cry 2, but the likes of Vaas, Hoyt and Citra definitely rank amongst the more memorable characters from recent first-person shooters.Graphically, the game is lush and even beautiful. Whilst not quite the equal of the still-astonishing Crysis in its depiction of a jungle environment, it is still a remarkable graphical environment. Combat is much more satisfying than its predecessor, with a pleasing mix of long-range sniper and close-up assault options. The 'magic binoculars' from Far Cry (and missing from FC2) return, allowing you to 'tag' enemies and keep track of them even through walls. Whilst still being completely nonsensical, they are nevertheless a vital and welcome tool to help plan attacks.On the negative side, the game is tonally disjointed. The main storyline features a thematic element in which your character's evolution from urban city-dweller to mystical jungle warrior (complete with magical tattoos) is commented on, with a sideline in musings on the corrosive effects of violence on the soul. Whilst it remains interesting that a game which features shooting people in the head actually takes time out to dwell on the consequences of such violence, it's also the case that this element is not particularly developed very far. Also, every violent game of recent note has done this, leading to the suspicion that such an element is being thrown in as a sop to justify its violence rather than a genuine attempt at commentary. Less philosophically, the game sometimes feels like a bit of a mish-mash between a linear, story-driven adventure and an open-world free-for-all, with the two sides of the game not meshing as well as they good.Ultimately, Far Cry 3 (****) is a ridiculous amount of fun. As a pure first-person shooter, it's the finest example the genre has thrown up in several years. It's a careful and successful refinement of the best elements of its predecessors, with the negative factors mostly removed. Whilst not as broodingly atmospheric as the recent Dishonored, in terms of a game being a sheer joy to play, it's a triumphant success and one of the best games of the year.", "This is a great game.  You do not have to follow the story line and there are many missions within the game separate from the main story line.  Graphics are great as is the overall story line.  Highly recommended.", "Far Cry 3 is a great game that will having you wanting for more once you finish the game. This game is very similar to the Grand Theft Auto games. The game is an open world game that is set in the jungle. The game has tons of different missions and none of the missions feel repetitive in nature. The game mechanics are good and there are some good Role Playing Game (RPG) elements to the game which makes you want to upgrade your character. You can easily get about 50 hours of gameplay out of this game. The game does not have any dead spots and is definitely not boring. I enjoyed this game and would definitely recommend it.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "\"This is one amazing piece of software.  Seldom have I seen a game where mostly every aspect is done so competently.  Whether it be shooting, driving vehicles, hunting, stealth, A.I. or presentation, it excels at pretty much everything it sets out to do and combines all of these elements so seamlessly together that it leads to an incredibly immersive, tense experience and a game that's an outright blast to play from start to finish.Farcry 3 places you in the shoes of Jason Brody, who has been kidnapped alongside his friends while on vacation on Rook Island to be sold into slavery by pirates.  Jason escapes, his friends do not, and he sets out on a quest of self-discovery and vengeance to be able to get them back.  That's pretty much all you need to know about the story and what the game's about and to say anymore would spoil a slightly above average narrative that's nevertheless well told with interesting, well-fleshed out characters (Vaas is awesome....Kefka has some competition).  It's nothing extraordinary but it does the job and while it's not even close to the best cinema and literature have to offer, it does constitute one of the better efforts that gaming gives these days.Gameplay consists of three main components: shooting/stealth, looting/selling, and hunting/crafting.  It's very S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-ish in this respect and gives it more of an RPG flavor.  Jason starts out very limited in what he can carry (barely any weapons, ammo, mines, c4, etc.) and it's required to venture out into the wilderness to gather animal skins and plants to create bigger pouches and also ingredients to formulate potions for syringes that hold a variety of effects.  The early stages of the game really necessitate doing this as running into enemies and even the less dangerous animals can lead to an early demise very easily.  Many may find this an annoyance but I find it enforces consideration of action while also allowing the player become familiar with game mechanics and world.  This is made easier as the game world is HUGE and there is plenty of space to move around in to hide and experiment.  This game is simply massive, and it's all open for the exploring from the get go with a few exceptions.  The main objective (aside from story missions) are to deactivate towers a la Assassin's Creed which will reveal more of the map. From there you can clean up pirate camps, take on side missions, or do whatever you want to do.And the game makes sure to supply you with a large selection of destructive toys at your disposal to be able to do so.  From pistols to assault rifles, sub-machine guns, shotguns, rocket launchers, sniper rifles, mines, molotovs, or my favorite...the bow, choose your poison.  They each have their unique purpose and are all different enough to warrant experimentation and mostly all can have attachments such as silencers, scopes, or extended magazines, to name a few.  Killing of all types gains experience.  Experience affords skill points which allow new abilities to becoming unlocked, abilities such as multiple take-downs, swimming faster or deeper, reloading while viewing through the scope, healing quicker, etc.  Jason evolves in capability throughout and you pick these abilities based on your preferred playstyle (the heron, the shark, and the spider-stealth, aggressive, and another I can't remember).  Farcry 3 also gives a large assortment of vehicles to get around in such as hang gliders, jeeps, buggies, jet-skis, assault boats, and a particular item of fast travel obtained later on that is just AWESOME.  Don't want to bother trekking long distances?  Fast travel clear across the map to and from any enemy outpost you've cleared.But you'll more than likely want to drive or hump it because everything is so enjoyable and there's something happening over the next corner or a new place to explore.  The combat is intense and visceral, not only because the weapons modelling is well done but also because the enemy A.I., for the most part, knows what it's doing.  I find it astonishing that A.I. could be so good in such a vast environment but it is.  Enemies run from cover to cover and hide, flank, and will jump away from grenades.  They use grenades and molotovs and will pursue you relentlessly.  And their reactions are believable as well.  For example, if they witness a friend being taken down by an obvious sniper, they'll all immediately scatter in different directions and yell \"\"Sniper!!\"\", running to find cover based on the direction they thought the shot came from.  If they find a body they'll go investigate it and then spread out to search.  It certainly has its moments of stupidity like pirates driving into rivers and drowning, but all in all it does the job.  And I find the vehicles to be a blast to drive.  They feel just right to control and unlike many other games feel like they're actually on the road instead of just skimming above it.As I said in the first paragraph, one of the main things Farcry 3 does so well is immerse you in its world.  Everything feels alive, and this is due to a variety of factors.  Firstly, I've always found first person shooters never to be truly first person.  Mostly all FPSes I've played in the past have had a \"\"head camera on a stick\"\" feel to them.  Ubisoft has done an excellent job of making the player feel like they're in a virtual body that exists in the world and I find it lends a enormous sense of connection to playing the character and being in the environment.  This is all accomplished through first person animations of his actions.  When he jumps over a fence, you see his legs vault over.  When you climb a ledge, you see his arms pull him up.  Getting into a car has him move as if in a body instead of a simple camera moving there.  Healing shows him actually doing physical actions on his body (wrapping wounds with bandages, digging out bullets with a knife).  When animals attack they grip onto Brody's virtual limbs.  You get the idea.  THIS is true first person gaming if I've ever seen it.  Crysis and Mirror's Edge did it as well but IMO not as good as here.Secondly, the world is 100% dynamic.  Reason being is that it has its own ecologic system at play with many different animals that have their own behavior and present different threats.  There's also two opposing factions (pirates and rebels) that frequently get into engagements.  Animals will attack pirates and each other and oftentimes throw themselves into the middle of a firefight.  Refreshingly, it does not at all feel like Jason is the center of the world.  You can hear things such as gunfight going on from far away (often with panicked screams giving an indication of to the situation....\"\"It's a tiger!!! S***, shoot it!!\"\"), or animals fighting.  Entire camps can be cleared from a bear all of a sudden coming out of the wilderness to attack the enemy, just as you're ready to execute your plan.  It's a perfect recipe for emergent game-play and it's constantly happening....nothing is predictable on Rook Island.  Everything is so random it never becomes boring and it's quite easy to be pulled off the main quest to see what that sound is over the hill, which may lead you to doing a side mission that'll last for 15 minutes.All of this would be lessened if the presentation wasn't there to hold it up, but it is.  I upgraded my rig just for this and am running it on a 3.4 Ghz, 8 gigs, GTX 670 4 gigs running Windows 7.  It's on ultra and it is beautiful.  I still think modded Crysis looks better, but Farcry 3 is surely no slouch in the visual department.  There are a few bland textures here and there and pop-in when using the hang glider but that's to be expected with a game of this size.  While the visuals are decent, it's the sound that I find truly impressive.  Guns sound hefty and powerful.  Sniper shots crack and reverberate a few seconds in the air and vehicles sound like the squeaky old clunkers they are.  Jason grunts with exertion while climbing and huffs and puffs while sprinting.  The voice acting is superb as is the pirate chatter in and out of combat (pretty humorous as well).  The overall sound design only compliments the feeling of the world being alive and the feeling of you really being in it.As much praise I can lay at Farcry 3's feet, there are some negatives I can think of.  I'm editing this part, (12/27/12), as at this point patches have come out that have remedied a few of these issues when this review was initially written, and also to add some general observations after more extensive time with the game.On the technical side:-quests sometimes restart if something is not done in the proper order that the game is expecting, and oftentimes scripted events fail to trigger.-you can't save anywhere, it's all checkpoint based though the saving is very smartly done and almost never becomes a problem.-selling looted items has to be done one at a time instead of in groups which becomes tedious and cumbersome.-when reassigning buttons in the controls, the game carries these specific assignments to other saves.  So if two people have different keyboard configs in two separate game files, they have to change them back from the other's save file in the config menu each time they load their own game.-I've had some texture problems and it has crashed once.-A.I. is inconsistent, though I still maintain for how big the game is it's more than adequate.And some general gameplay gripes:-it all looks the same.  I know it's in the tropics, but I live on Maui and I can attest to you that it's not all palm trees and grass everywhere.  There's large expanses of desert drylands.  Deep dark rain forests with enormous ceilings.  Huge lava fields.  I must say, as big as Farcry 3's scope is, it's a disappointment that there's not more variety in its environments.-the early game is better than the late.  Reason being is that hunting and looting becomes pointless once everything is upgraded and all the weapons are unlocked.  Once that happens, all the incentive to explore is largely diminished.  They should have found a way to keep both just as important near the end as they were in the beginning.  Perhaps loot that didn't just translate into money but increased Brody's skill set or weapon capabilities.Despite the above, the positives far outweigh the negatives.  I have to admit, I don't like Ubisoft.  I find many of their business practices detestable and think they've fallen far from their heyday, but I'd be lying if I said that Farcry 3 hasn't restored some faith in them and in my eyes has proven they still have some serious talent under their belt.  It is an very well done open world FPS, to me the best in years that encompasses and executes everything that makes such games so enjoyable almost flawlessly.  If you're a fan of open world games in any way, then you owe it to yourself to play this.\"", "I enjoyed this game. For someone that prefers RPG's to any other style of game, this game was really fun. Nonetheless, beyond the pretty graphics and the fun gameplay, there wasn't a whole lot to keep you going. As always my reviews are split between story, gameplay, and characters.Story: 6.5/10Yeah the story is basically you and your friends are partying on an island when you are kidnapped by pirates. They kill your brother and you escape and are trying to rescue the rest. But other than that, there just isn't a lot there. Yeah there is some weird voodoo going on on the island but just not much there. Now, I fully understand this is a FPS. FPS games by and large do not have a great story as the focus is on the gameplay. That being said, the story was still pretty shallow. If this had been an RPG i would have given the story a 2 or a 3. Nonetheless the story was there and it was decent enough to carry you through the game. There are two endings and both endings are just kind of...well they end the story.Gameplay: 8.5/10Now the gameplay is the obvious strength of this game. The shooting mechanics are phenomenal. The stealth aspect of this game is probably the best of any game I have played. Simply phenomenal. The whole hunting aspect to improve your gear was simply wonderful. It was awesome. Sniping, flamethrowing, grenades, assault rifles, machetes, rocket launchers, BOW AND FRIGGIN ARROW, just simply awesome. The whole, taking over compounds and winning back parts of the island was simply awesome. 10/10 on all that. I wish you could periodically lose parts of the island, I think that would have been fun but there was enough there that it really didn't detract from it.Unfortunately, there was some annoying things about the gameplay that just detracted from the overall experience. First the whole loot and exploring to find loot was largely pointless. The entire island was riddled with chests to find but every flipping one of them consisted of money ranging from 5-45 bucks and a item that could only be sold for 1-200 bucks..plus some ammo. No awesome armor, or cool weapons, or neat explosive bullets or something. Just money and an item that turns into money. They did have some neat items like finding special letters and artifacts but other than achievements and experience, those were rendered pointless as well.As far as the sidequests and missions and such went it was a mixed bag. All of the missions were awesome. Hunting a pack of rabid wolves with a rocket launcher? AWESOME. Taking out a group of pirates and being forced to kill the leader with a knife and only a knife. also AWESOME. Taking over a compound with the extra challenge of not triggering any alarms and never being seen? FRIGGIN AWESOME. Racing to get medical supplies from point a to point b in a certain amount of time. Fun but not as awesome as the rest. Overall these missions were great. BUT those are the ONLY missions there are. Hunting for an animal, taking out a pack of pirates or baddies with a knife, delivering medical supplies, winning compounds. That's it. Sure there are a few random sidequests that don't exactly match those 4 quests sprinkled throughout the island. But most of them consist of little more than go fetch this, or go talk to this guy and come back.Largely, the game consists of you opening up a sector of the island, winning the compounds, doing the quests associated with the compounds that are either hunting or taking out a pack of bad guys, do the medical supply drop then moving on to the next sector. That all being said, the quests themselves are really fun. But it would have been nice if there was a little more variety.Characters 6/10The characters are completely forgettable and really not even worth mentioning. Ragtag group of rich kids gets captured on an island and the one guy that actually seems like he could survive on the island gets killed in the beginning. You take over as that guy's brother Jason and go on to kill a crap ton of pirates and mercenaries while becoming a member of some weird tribe, while trying to rescue your friends. Jason goes from pansy to rambo over night. Didn't really buy that but it is what it is. The rest of your friends consist of rich boy, little brother, two chicks with little personality, and a pot head. There really isn't anything here. HOWEVER...the reason it didn't get a 1/10 is because of two characters. The first was Vaas. The first villain. This dude is legitimately insane and friggin hilarious. One of the better villains in video games. Very crazy, very intense, very funny. The second was Sam, your undercover assistant on the second island after Vaas. German guy who is just simply hilarious. Hardcore dude. But very entertaining.Overall: 7/10The game is worth playing but I don't think it deserves all the hype that it got when it came out. The strength of this game is easily the gameplay. It is phenomenal as far as game mechanics. However, there are plenty of little things about the gameplay that are just annoying and overall the play through gets repetitive after a while. With the expected shallow story, annoying tidbits of gameplay, and mostly forgettable characters, there is enough negative about the game that blemish it's overall awesomeness. There is an awesome game here that with a little polish and a little more depth could have been an amazing game. Nonetheless, this game is worth playing and is an enjoyable ride.", "\"I loved the first Far Cry and hated the second, so was quite wary of Far Cry 3. My fears seemed to be realized when I hit the first Quicktime events. At the urging of my son, I persisted, though it took me at least two hours of play before I really got the hang of how the game really worked. At that point it sucked me in. Almost. There remained the problem of Quicktime events and a really jarring, and quite lame, cut scene story that takes you out of the game.The greatest part of this game is how well the open world mode works. Ironically, that makes the restricted missions and \"\"railroad\"\" cut scenes all the more jarring--it's like two games in one, with one being truly great.Possible spoilers:I also got the distinct impression that the original game was extended by adding a second island. The guy you thought was the main boss wasn't. Worse, you don't even get to really kill either based on your ability; instead you are subject to a truly awful series of cut scenes with quick time events. All that matters is how well you mash keys. It was extremely anti-climatic.My other main criticism, though minor, is that taking out enemy bases got a little tedious. There were times that I deliberately let alarms go off just to make it more challenging. I wish a little more thought had gone into making the end-game bases much more difficult in every way.Again, however, the great parts of Far Cry 3 are truly awesome.\"", "Only a few times a year does a game like this come out. 2012 saw a lot of big games, although only a few held up. I played quite a few of these amazing games in 2012. Borderlands 2, The Walking Dead, Mass Efffect 3, Halo 4, XCOM, etc - but Far Cry 3 really stood out. I'm not saying it was the best, but man - it was good. The story is awesome. There are a few rocky points where you wish you could make decisions for you character and you cringe at what he's about to do. Jason's (your character) voice takes a little while to get used to as well. It's really soft, I don't understand why they chose such a light-hearted voice for a college kid. He sounds like a high school history teacher, not the young/crazy guy he's supposed to be.The game is long and filled with side-missions. I didn't do them, but if you're into that there's probably an extra 5+ hours in side missions. The hunting, gathering, etc is never necessary - but makes the game a lot more fun. You can get new weapon holsters to carry several guns at once, or you can be lazy and stick with 1 or 2 guns. You can take back radio towers. (Climbing them was always amazing, I think they implemented them just as an excuse to show off their world from a high vantage point.) These radio towers unlock new weapons for reduced or free prices.Honestly I could go on about the game, but I'm going to stop. I liked it more than Skyrim, because I actually got into the story and there wasn't an overwhelming amount of stuff to do. There was plenty to do, but I could also see an end. The gameplay mechanics are near-perfect, the story is engrossing, the world is intriguing and beautiful, the characters are AMAZING, and the game is overall extremely fun. My first playthrough took over 20 hours.Oh and the part where (minor spoiler) you are burning the weed crops and the Skrillex song starts playing is one of my all time favorite moments in gaming - and I've played a LOT of games.NOTE: The game is hard to run on higher settings - I have a GTX 680 and preferred playing without anti-aliasing on at all. Although everything else was maxed.", "\"I don't really understand all the hype over this game.  I got a DL code as part of a video card purchase and I haven't played Farcry 2.  Played the original way back but dont remember much of it.  I thought this game looked pretty cool and it was a nice way to test my new Radeon 7850.  Well, honestly, the game is pretty mediocre and as far as my tastes go it's forgettable.  It emulates sandbox type games mixed with FPS.  Cool concept but I guess because I am older I found this game to be as much of a drag as Borderlands.  The story is absolutely ludicrous, the play mechanics are horribly clunky, the graphics are nice at times but glitchy in others, and the overall feel of the game is that it was unfinished.The good.The overall graphics are nice.  The environments are cool in the jungle and the vistas and walking around at first can be real nice.  However over time the beauty of the island is spoiled by the lack of creativity and diversity.Character building is cool, even in FPS games.  Adds a bit of progression to the game.The bad.A lot.I found the graphics to be slightly off in many instances.  Almost as if I could never get the resolution quite right.Controls are insanely clunky and worse you have to \"\"unlock\"\" basic abilities like reloading while running.  Things just never seemed to work smoothly in the game often times making combat frustrating.Hit detection is dreadful.  Point blank shots to center mass or the head will miss frequently.  Worse, enemy health is absurdly high.  Empty a whole clip into a stock enemy or a bear alike and most likely they will keep charging.  Headshots are crucial for basic enemies while animal kills are pretty much luck of the draw if you can get enough shots in but most animals move too fast to really mess with.  Many basic human enemies will have terrible aim.  They will stand in front of you and miss wildly but then in certain fights they will rush right up to you and kill you in a split second.  Its completely unpredictable when the enemy AI will be good or not.Combat is always a mess.  Its hard enough to see in a jungle but the enemies can hide in the bushes easily but still see you even though you cant see them.  If you break stealth in a fight it summons an endless wave of respawn baddies.  Pretty lame honestly that you are on a remote island with an endless supply of bad guys who just magically appear.  Your reinforcements are worthless.  THey never show up when they say they will and they rarely kill anyone.  You pretty much have to do all the work then if you walk 10 feet out of an area and turn around they will all be back anyway.Since this is an FPS stealthy is a messy execution.  Sure you can crouch and sneak in for knife kills but thats about it.  Stealth pretty much boils down to you crouching and walking around enemy fields of vision.  Metal Gear this is not.The progression system is pretty poorly executed.  Sure its nice to feel you are building a character but FC3 pretty much just seems like work.  You need to kill X number of boars, Tigers, Bears, etc to craft items to help you out.  It's pretty absurd that you have to leave cash laying around because your wallet will only hold 2000 bucks or whatever.  You have to unlock additional weapon slots and ammo pouches.  Its slow going at first and a pain.  Hard to find the required animals to make the items you need and you cant skip levels.  By the time you do actually craft most of your items you don't really need much money anymore.  Having to craft health kits pretty much just makes healing more of a chore than fun.  The crafting menu navigation is a true exercise in patience.  Whoever thought up the navigation of these menus should be fired.  It seems heavily console focused and on the PC having to jump back and fourth between items is just a cursed mess.  These menus could have been so much more intuitive but their current execution renders the whole crafting element to the game that much more unlikeable.Driving is pathetic.  Not mush else to stay.  It's a tropical island but you would think its all ice.  The cars are all the same battered jeeps and they slide all over the place and handle like garbage.  I pretty much avoided driving as much as possible.The story was the lamest thing I have seen in a while.  Granted I dont play nearly as many games as I used to but I certainly could care less what happened to these characters.Overall.I just don't understand the hype for this game.  I'm not a massive FPS player but I do enjoy them.  This game has a ton of fans but I dont see the value.  It's a frustrating FPS drag with a lame story.  After a few hours into the game I just felt like it was work rather than fun.  So many other more enjoyable titles out there.  I play RPG games for \"\"work\"\" feel.  FPS games just don't seem capable of pulling off the modified RPG feel and if Farcry was going after Grand Theft Auto for the sandbox king they failed miserably.  They missed all that GTA did well and put in all the boring junky grinds mixed with less than polished combat physics.If this game had been given a final coat of polish by the devs before release it could have been better but in this state I think it's just one more example of a completely over-rated mass marketed FPS stinker..\"", "Awesome game, turned out to be my personal GotY winner. Simple controls, beautiful design/graphics, smart AI, etc. I play on easy but the game is still challenging, I go in with everything bow and try to stealth everything out. I am around ~10 hours in and it was well worth the 29.99 spent through Amazon's deal.Uplay - I honestly don't understand the hatred? I simply made an account, the install was fast (took around 5 minutes for everything), I registered (takes 20 seconds at the max), I activated the game (last step after installing the game), and I started playing (after installing the game of course). I have had much more troublesome using Origin or trying to get a product to activate on Steam via GMG (at times). I am assuming most of the 'Uplay' bad experience is user error.", "that's what someone told me about this game and it's very true.  very fun.  some of the side missions COULD be a little more fun and less repetitive.. but it's a really awesome game.i'd call it kinda.. skyrim crossed with assassin's creed crossed with a shooter.remember to make gun holster sack as soon as you can so you can hold more weapons (easy to do) -- really fun game! great price on amazon i got it for 30 bucks a month or so after release.  awesome stuff.", "\"The first Far Cry pretty much blindsided gamers when it came out in 2004.  From an unknown studio, here was this game with stunning graphics (which still hold up, by the way), an original setting for a shooter (a tropical paradise) and a sandbox-style approach.  Unfortunately, Far Cry 2 was a big letdown for most gamers.  While the graphics were pretty, it felt bland and repetitive, and never really immersed you in the environment or story.Far Cry represents a return to the roots of the first game, and adds a wealth of new features and option, adding to this First-Person Shooter a number of RPG elements.  You can now conquer outposts and create safehouses, where you can buy guns and sell loot.  The addition of a crafting feature (think Skyrim or World of Warcraft) adds the ability to make syringes, bigger gun holsters, bigger loot bags, etc.  It's integrated with the hunting aspect of the game, which allows you to kill and skin most of the wildlife on the island.  It's a nice addition, and the best part is that there is no real required order in which you have to do things.  If you want to get the best guns right away, you can buy them right away, with cash you loot from corpses and chests.  If you want to craft everything before starting the main mission storyline, you can.  One of the best addition is the bow and arrow - silent, mostly one-shot kills are a ton of fun.  That dovetails nicely into this game's emphasis on stealth.  Many missions can be done your way: you can run in, Rambo style and blow everything up, but it's also feasible to skulk around the shadows and pick off the baddies one by one.The main story is a mixed bag.  The voice acting is mostly very good, and the story is interesting- you and your friends were on some spring break tropical getaway when things go very wrong.  The problem is that you and your friends are annoying frat boys and girls, and it makes it tough to care whether I save my \"\"bros\"\" or not.  After a while the main story can become a drag, though they do keep the missions varied.The graphics are topnotch, especially if you have a newer PC.  There are no perceptible loading times between zone, and the island is huge.  The sound is also terrific, and if you have 5.1 sound you will love the ambient effects, animal noises, etc.  It really does add to the immersion and tactical feel of the game.There are a few things that could be improved.  1)The save game system is awful. It's essentially a checkpoint system, and you CANNOT save anywhere.  While on a mission, you must complete the mission or start over before you can save.  Why they wouldn't let gamers save anywhere is beyond, especially in an open-ended game.  2)Looting corpses is annoying.  You use the same button (E) to loot corpses, switch weapons with dropped guns and skin animals.  Many times you'll be standing over the corpse, jiggling the pointer until the magical \"\"Press E to Loot\"\" prompt comes.  You should simply be able to click on the corpse and loot, like in many games, instead of hunting for the one spot you have to hover over to get the prompt.Overall though, this game is a ton of fun!\"", "((INTRO))Far Cry 2 was, while commercially successful, divisive game by Ubisoft that failed to recapture the magic of the original PC exclusive Far Cry (not the various console spin-offs), while Crytek, the developers of Far Cry, moved on to Crysis that revived and improved upon the spirit of Far Cry under EA (Of course Crytek later ran into a similar dismay with Crysis 2).After several botched attempts to rekindle the popularity of their old franchises such as Silent Hunter, Prince of Persia and Splinter Cell, alongside the annual milking-fest of Assassin's Creed and huge backlash of 'Always-Online' DRM fiasco, the name Ubisoft is not exactly synonymous with creative change and progress.Far Cry 2 was far cry from 'Far Cry' not because the setting was changed from tropical jungle to African jungle, but because the game was a drag to play and never maintained the consistent flow with tension and excitement from gameplay.  The color palette was washed out and heinously brown, the world felt lukewarm and monotonous.  And realistic but ultimately tedious chores that emulated the real life like far drive travel methods, cars breaking down for maintenance, guns jamming, malaria and it was a good FPS but a disappointing game at the same time that forgot how to be a fun game.Is Far Cry 3 any different from 'business as usual' approach by the developers slash publishers who's been doing just that for better part of the past 10 years?  Let me just say it out loud; Far Cry 3 is exactly the kind of the first person shooter for people who enjoyed the original Far Cry and Crysis.((THE GAME))The game starts with action right away just like the first one instead of puking and passing out over and over like the second one.  You are an ordinary every man, a young college kid named Jason Brody and you are stranded in the pirates-infested remote Rook Islands with your brothers and friends after skydiving gone wrong and captured by a despicable psychotic pirate leader named Vaas.  With no formal combat training, you narrowly escaped with your life and healed by a local named Dennis Rogers, and you slowly learn to be an efficient killer and take down all the pirates and Vaas and slowly reveal the politics of the Rook Islands that harbors a few intriguing plots that involve the handful of colorful characters and endless humanoids to kill.The setting is moved back to the tropics, but this time, you are given the whole islands without any barrier instead of the sectioned off areas like the first one.  And the game world is a huge open world consisted of two big islands and the vicinity with diverse topography and some unique landmarks and set pieces crowded with enemies and wild animals everywhere.  There are also many indoor, underground and underwater actions, and plenty of intense scripted big set piece moments.How refreshing is that there is a FPS that you cannot always go Rambo on?  While the gunplay is rock solid and action is just as intense, you cannot always run and gun in Far Cry 3.  Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of gun-toting action.  But you must learn to be stealthy.  In fact, running and gunning straight up would very often ends with your death.  Stealth has to be your preferred Modus Opperandi if you want to survive for long.  Luckily, the stealth approach is just as competent and rewarding as all out gunning approach.  Each encounter with enemies is fight for your survival.  You must learn how to use everything at your disposal to plan your route, something that was severely lacking in Far Cry 2.  You need to survey your surrounding using your camera and methodically plan your course of action sneaking using your knife and bow or sniper rifle to shave off the enemy number, then with the perfectly timing all out shooting to maximize the damage.  There can be many different methods of killing enemies using environment and wild animals.  Enemy A.I. is very relentless.  You wouldn't know how many times I wishfully uttered 'Cloak engaged, maximum armor' repeatedly.  All in all, the gameplay feels much more tight and the main story is focused and scripted as if in linear corridor shooters, and that is a good thing.Unlike the second game, it makes so much more sense to go around killing bad guys and cause mayhem and destruction precisely because you are stuck in isolated islands from the rest of civilization with those bad guys, and you gotta do what you gotta do to survive and escape from this hellhole.  No more convoluted inter-factions politics, just actions, and no more monsters / aliens / zombies twist in the second half, thank you so much for that.  You have several travel modes such as hang-glider, para-wings and parachute, many different vehicles and boats available.The story is interesting, if nothing special, but it's also grittier, more violent and serious than the tongue in cheek campy first Far Cry.  You will encounter several surreal drug-induced hallucination and psychological trips throughout the main story mission like Max Payne dream sequences or Arkham Asylum Scarecrow sequences.  They wisely focus on the pure unadulterated FPS action with breakneck pace using much restricted and guided linear progress within the main storyline.  Between each mission, you are free to roam around the open world.  You can liberate the entire islands section by section by climbing up the radio towers in the world and survey each area, doing so opens up your map to reveal key locations in the given area, a la Assassin's Creed.  Once you take down the area strongholds and clean up the bandits, the area become friendly.  Opening up the map also makes many different weapons and equipments available and new side activities.  Then you can engage in side quests and activities such as hunting, wanted reward, assassination, gambling, racing, etc.  What stands out with all the side activities is that they all directly reward you with leveling up.The robust crafting system lets you expand the various inventory capacities by hunting various wild animals scattered throughout the world.  Weapons customizations are very diverse and deep.  You gain XP points by killing hostiles and completing objectives, then you allocate those points to open up different skill perks and level up your abilities in form of ancient tribal tattoos.  Action and maneuvering vehicles are very realistic and intense.  The game world is bigger (10 times) than Far Cry 2, which was already huge, but it's also so much easier and fun to explore, thanks to many moving vehicles and fast travel system at all the safe houses you unlock.The graphics are very impressive, among the best with Crysis series and Just Cause 2 on PC, with DirectX 11 compatibility and all the bells and whistles of PC specific options.  Far Cry 3 Looks majestic on PC when you max all the possible options.  Unfortunately there's no destructible environment, a minor letdown.  The game also comes with a very competent map editor, just like the previous two and the first Crysis.((DRM))One time online activation via UPLAY, another proprietary DRM like STEAM and EA ORIGIN.((OUTRO))Ubisoft rectified all the shortcomings of Far Cry 2 by bringing back the core elements of Far Cry 1, infusing the things that worked in Far Cry 2 into Far Cry 3, and came out as a winner.  It's  now EA and Crytek's turn to correct the course with Crysis 3 to recapture the essence of Crysis 1 and Far Cry 1.If you are a shooter fans but are looking for something different from the annual slugfest between Call of Duty and its wannabes and are more keen to first person action games like System Shock 2, Deus Ex, No One Lives Forever, Far Cry 1 and Crysis 1, look no further; this is the game you want to play.  In my opinion, Far Cry 3 is not only better than Far Cry 2, but also better than Far Cry 1 and up there with Crysis, minus destructible environment and the nano-suit (oh, how I miss the suit), but Far Cry 3 does many things Crysis doesn't.With a long, focused story progress and single player story campaign that last 20 to 30 hours, huge open world environment with bunch of side activities, intense and smart first person shooting action, nice stand-alone co-op story campaign that lasts 4-5 hours and fun multiplayer modes, Far Cry 3 redeems the franchise and Ubisoft from the past sins, if briefly until the next 'all-too-familiar' fiasco that will surely happen unless Ubisoft goes through the fundamental changes.  But I am feeling very forgiving and immensely enjoying Far Cry 3 to think ahead that far for the moment.  Far Cry 3 is the most impressive first step toward the redemption, and a great sign for things to come.  Terrific job, Ubisoft!", "This game came free with the video card I got for my girlfriend.  She played it on her PC (Radeon 7970) and it ran perfectly but I also ran it on my own (Radeon.. 6000 series something or another) and it ran fine.  Obviously I had to lower some of the settings for mine.My girlfriend wasn't interested at all in the games that came with the video card - this, sleeping dogs, or Hitman Absolution.  I begger her to at least Try one of them, and to my surprise she tried this one.She absolutely loved it.  She said it felt to her like a combination of Red Dead Redemption and Assassin's Creed 2. I don't know if I see that reference exactly, but it works.I just beat the game yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  I'm sure if I was more critical of games I'd probably give it a 4 instead cause .. I don't know, not enough characters with personality or not enough choices or something? But honestly I've learned to just play games for fun, and I had a ton here. The characters they do introduce are interesting and usually kind of funny in their own way.The gun-play is excellent in my opinion and very satisfying.  Feels a little better than Farcry 2 as I remember it.The story is actually a lot of fun. It's simple, similar to the recent Tomb Raider game with the whole -normal person to savage killer- type ... plot? But unlike tomb raider, your character does lose himself quite a bit throughout the story and that really does add some depth to it. The game even offers a slight choice at the end with 2 very different (but one very sucky) endings. You'll have to use Youtube to watch the second one (Autosave and all that won't let you go back and pick the other choice).I go back and forth from PC gaming to console gaming so I'm a bit more adaptive than my girlfriend who pretty exclusively does PC gaming (why she has the better PC). There are some quick time events that have you using your mouse clicks, Spacebar, W, and other buttons to progress scenes (not too many luckily).  That bothered her more than it bothered me, but I can vouch for the fact that those scenes would have been more comfortable on a controller or console. But, I never had to redo a single one, so they were still very doable.Also, the stupid game doesn't give you the option to set Crouch to Toggle or Hold. I hate that. If you put it on PC let the gamer customize things as they wish.  And if you're curious - the game forces you to use Crouch as a Toggle, which is more comfortable on a controller definitely... but I don't think it is for a keyboard/mouse.But those are my only complaints. I saw probably 2 glitches my whole time, including one cutscene where a machine gun kept floating around in circles while someone was talking to me. Nothing game breaking in my playthrough, very solid experience overall.Just to mention - I played this game through UPlay instead of Steam (it's how the bundle came with the video card).  I prefer Steam, but possibly UPlay supports the game a bit better since it's UbiSoft? I don't know.Girlfriends computer is a AMD fx-350 (8 core, 4ghz), 16gb memory, Radeon 7970Mine is a... AMD 4 core at 2.6ghz (don't remember the model, it's older), 4gb of memory, and a Radeon 6670 I Think. Whatever it is, it isn't exceptional anymore by any means.Both were running Windows 7 (64 bit).  She ran the game at 1920x1080 and I ran it at.. something closer to 1280x720 (had to goof around to make it fit perfectly).  She ran all the settings at Mad Ultimate, I ran them at Medium to High (kept Shadows and Reflections pretty low).We both had a grand old time. You should give it a shot.", "They finally got it right.  I remember how bad\\good the first one was.  This Far Cry is great.  The graphics are good and the game play is long, not even including all of the side mission, let alone the DLCs.  For $19, it is a steal.  I've had it for months and am still playing it.", "Far Cry 1 was arcade-ish and fun. Far Cry 2 took the whole &#34;Realism&#34; thing to a fault and dropped you in a fairly unfun, static but beautiful world.Far Cry 3 takes the beauty of #2, makes the world even more alive (animals, hunting, getting attacked by things, etc.) and brings back the simpler fun of #1 then ads an awesome story that Ubisoft has become so versed at on top of it and you end up with a hell of a fun/beautiful game to just enjoy your time in.I am not the type to love finishing games on Hardcore and if I die/retry a level or event too many times, I'll just stop playing something because all it does is serve to piss me off while I am trying to relax. Far Cry 3 is NOT like this at all, but I was so worried it would be which is why I waited so long to pick it up.Was really happy to see that Ubisoft did a good job focusing on the fun here.Also there is no bullcrap like in Assassins Creed where the badguys can RECLAIM claimed land (I hate that) -- once you rescue a zone, it stays rescued which gives you a great sense of accomplishment as you go.", "Fun first-person shooter with a bit of an RPG twist. The game offers a good amount of expansion and upgrade options without feeling overly complex. The graphics are great, but they come at a hefty price as high hardware specs (quad core CPU or higher and GTX 500+/Radeon 7000+) are pretty much required. On the plus side though, the game does utilize hardware very well - I didn't notice any bottlenecks like I did with Skyrim when it first released.Lastly, the game suffers from console-port-itis... No real shortcuts to crafting or skill menus or the guidebooks make it slow-going when you need to craft items or skill up. Just in general, the UI feels a bit off.Overall, I'd recommend the game.", "\"I was a little disappointed that the original \"\"Farcry\"\" wasn't reprised in this one, and doesn't look like it ever will be.  Yes, that game was very stereotypical with it's sci-fi setting, sarcastic ex-military hero, a heroine nearly as tough as him, and a scientist helper, but the game was aware of that and played it up.  Farcry was fun, and was probably the first game to successfully create a jungle environment that worked.Farcry2 had in common only the name, being set in Africa among warring factions.  Mostly to anyone who played it the game seemed more like \"\"Grand Theft Auto: Africa\"\" and was a lot of driving to get anywhere.This one combines the two; from Farcry we have again a jungle environment with Japanese ruins from World War Two, even older ancient ruins (this time Chinese), hang gliders that do more than short hops, and boats.From Farcry2 we have the driving environment, radio towers, and a gradual buildup of skills and equipment.  At the 3/4 mark the game shifts to a smaller island with more advanced weapons and challenges. We also have competing factions again, this time the native Rakyat, pirates, and privateers, who are all color coded by blue, red, and yellow.New to the series is crafting medicines from plants and using animal skins to make carrying pouches and satchels.  You also use an arrow--but it never has a point where you have to completely use hand weapons aside from some dedicated hunting quests. Having a segment of the game where you had to entirely improvise weaponry would have been appealing.Changeups from Farcry2 is the radio towers are used to open up parts of the map, and a big improvement is each liberated fort can be used for instant \"\"rapid\"\" travel which is good, as the game is huge.Neither here nor there is the repetitiveness.  You have 18 towers and 34 forts.  Each tower has a supply drop mission and each fort has a couple of hunter/kill someone quests.  Unlike Farcry2 where, for example, the delivering medicine quest was always exactly the same thing each one of these is different, even the radio towers are a puzzle to climb them.  Still, there's only so many ways to take over a fort.The campaign--well, in Farcry Jack Carver was a jerk but he was a fun jerk.  Jason Brody is a dorky kid.  The game at times seems to edge into a psychological down the rabbit hole journey but never goes through.  I sorely missed the humor of the original Farcry, although \"\"Sam\"\" added some needed comic relief.  Still, in the end we had no sci-fi backdrop, just mercenary fighting, and no real development--that the character has really done much more than learn to fight real good.  All the psychological/spiritual elements just go \"\"poof\"\" and you have two choices at the end, the \"\"win\"\" choice that almost everyone will take and a \"\"lose\"\" choice.Overall just to do the campaign would probably be about 9 hours, to fully upgrade and liberate the islands about 16 hours, to complete all the quests who knows.  You get your money's worth, it's an enormous game with lots of challenges, but still feels disappointing.\"", "They did it right this time - mostly. (Far Cry 2 was a real disappointment). Although FC3 is not at all like the first FC, except for being back in the tropics, it's a refreshing combination of FPS and RPG. You can go as far either way as you'd like... gather items, craft items, build points and personal resources... or just sneak around and pop off the enemy for as long as you'd like. Graphics are beautiful if a little bit 'choppy', and I find the AI pretty darn good! I've been dying quite often. The game is huge... I've barely scratched the map surface! But what I've seen in my first several hours is impressive! The story holds my interest enough and the characters are well developed. It's quite addictive, and find myself coming back in - shortly after leaving - to finish a mission - which can be difficult on just 'normal' setting! I guess the old 'hit F5 to save instantly' is gone for good in these modern games, so it does get VERY REPETITIVE on more occasions that I care for. NOT GOOD. I've found there is a bit of a learning curve at the beginning... and am still learning. It appears the game could last for many days... not just hours!!! Replay-ability is a given, IMO. Loads quickly, easy controls, very smooth (i7, 16 gigs, Asus mb, 250 gig ATI, etc). No problem with Uplay - although next to Steam it looks like it was built for 12 year olds (I'm an older long-time FPS fan from way back, I can be very critical, so my 5 stars should mean alot ;-)  Good job Ubisoft, but bad save system IMO!!!UPDATE: OK... THE BAD: I find the save intervals very frustrating. I almost get thru a very looong intense mission only to 'die' at the very end then have to RE-PLAY the whole episode! I know: typical. But I'll be taking a solid star off of my review.UPDATE: Uninstalled from my computer. Sorry... I gave it a HUGE chance. After 'swimming' to the pirate ship and undergoing at least 8 re-tries, and mashing 'space bar',  'C' and 'E' keys as much as I could, I always drown and die. Perhaps it's me... but having to re-do after MASHING the instructed keys over and over again sucks big-time. Tiresome. Boring. Etc. THEN, after I quit in frustration (at this point, the game does give you another chance to 'not' drown thru mashing and re-mashing keys)... and return to try again: I'M BACK IN THE WATER SWIMMING TO THE PIRATED SHIP needing to redo the whole 'mission' episode again... and again... and again. So long Far Cry 3. I don't call this 'fun'. (Ubisoft... what were you thinking?).", "It began innocently enough as you are on vacation with your brother and friends in a lush tropical paradise. But while skydiving in the rook islands your friends land in various places and are taken hostage to be sold by the pirate lord Vaas. As you are captured you make your escape but will you have the courage to find your friends and save them? These are the questions asked in the newest installment from the great minds at ubisoft in Far Cry 3.After you play thru the tutorial which explains not just how to move and shoot but how you can capture radio towers that unlock portions of the map. These are important especially if you want to fast travel to these locations. But don't worry you won't just be walking around the islands as there are loads of vehicles that you can commandeer. You will have choices on land (atv's  and jeeps) sea (boats and jetskis) and even the air (hang gliders) to make travel around the vast map easier.The game is an open world and can be played in basically any order you choose. You can just pursue the story missions to rescue your friends or you can tackle sidequests to give you more resources. As with Far Cry 2 there are enemy outpost that you can take over and while it is hard it does have it's advantages. First it rids the area of roving pirates so you'll be able to explore and hunt that area easier and you can fast travel to that location as well. The islands are also lush with various wildlife that you can kill as well and you'll need this to craft better gear for yourself. This impacts everything from how many weapons you can carry to how much loot you can drag around.Far Cry 3 looks amazing whether it's on the PS3, Xbox or even the PC as the graphics look as if you're dropped deep into a jungle. The characters look great and they will split up and attack you so you need to watch out for that. The only problem I have with this game is there is a story mission that is completely stealth based. If you are spotted they raise the alarm and you will fail the mission and have to start over from the beginning. Needless to say I had to do this mission countless times until I finally cleared it.If you are a fan of first person shooters and love open world games as well then getting Far Cry 3 is a no brainer.", "Whatever you do, do not listen to any review below a 4 star as this game is beautiful, runs perfectly on a AMD 955BE and a HD6870 and is weeks, yes weeks of fun gaming, it is actually like 4 games in 1 there is so much to do and see in this game (like 10x's more than Crysis 3 which took me 5 hrs to finish and only has 7 levels see review on that)  This is by far the best Farcry yet and the largest.  you can hunt animals - hunt king pins - do story mode - play texas hold-em - collect letters, treasures and idols (lots of which are hidden in caves that you might have to swim or parachut to.  how awesome is that? the only thing that is kinda weak are the lame  side missions..  this is prob the best game of the year - better than colonial marines, dmc, tomb raider etc"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.011979537084698677, 0.10545971989631653, 0.07382079213857651, 0.054591916501522064, 0.033774226903915405, 0.08469341695308685, 0.009327786043286324, 0.0719384253025055, 0.040281761437654495, 0.05957215279340744, 0.016377823427319527, 0.009473245590925217, 0.001826321822591126, 0.06867747753858566, 0.05156276375055313, 0.0048485081642866135, 0.08962886780500412, 0.009553121402859688, 0.11877996474504471, 0.08383218199014664]]}
