That is always easier to say and to actually do it.  Our lives are full of committements.  Usually exercise is the last thing we want to commit to because we neither have the time (3 kids) nor the expense (no gym).So we stumbled upon this game at Microsoft Store and it was on sale for cheap.  We snapped it up with some hesitation because it is Kinect after all.  We were thinking of how good this going to be.We tried a few sessions and a few games and surprisingly loving it.  It is divided into several sections and you can tailor to how intense you want to work out.  If you are new and never actually been active working out, starting from beginning is best.  The core exercise provides some basics and some tutorials on what to expect.  I've seen a review that negatively think there are no tutorials, which I adamantly disagree.  Before the session starts, the trainer provides a brief step of the routine.  Any adults with proper mobility will have no trouble following it.Once you have all the basics on the targetted areas, go for the intense boot camp or the \"\"own it\"\" boxing.  After a few sessions you can feel your heart pumping and your sweat starts pouring.  Finally end your session either with some hip-hop or Yoga.  After you done all the routines, go back to each one and try to nail 100% achievement.I intend to do a video of the game on my YouTube channel soon.  Keep an evey for user name: EasyLife8888.This is the best Kinect game I've every bought.  For the price of the game console and the game, you can have your own personal trainer right in your own living room.Finally, if my wife gives the stamp of approval, you know it is good.\"", "\"As an owner of the original Kinect game, and a player of many other workout games since (UFC, Biggest Loser, etc) I have to say that I'm pleasantly surprised with this new version.As the original one did, the game gives you a body scan when you originally sign in.  That image is then what is used to play games.  Oddly enough though, I've yet to find anywhere in the game where I can modify anything it measured.  It also didn't ask me for my weight so I have no idea where to input that or update it. It did recognize that I was a previous player and carried over my calorie burn count which I thought was great.  After that, a ton of achievements were unlocked, which I also didn't mind :)Gone are the days of the dreaded menu system from the past.  Now, your hands are used in a push and hold motion to activate what you want to do.  This is much improved over the old hold the arm out with hand extended to touch a dot for 4 seconds to activate.  I always had problems with that one.The main menu is broken down into 4 sections:  My Zone (your settings, goals etc...btw, be sure to go in and change the measurement system to Imperial for those in the US since it is defaulted to metric), Activities, Workouts and Classes.  Once I told the game what I wanted to achieve (with several options to choose from) it created a routine for me to follow and there are several to choose from:Classes include African Rhythms, Boot Camp, Hip Hop, Bollywood, Cardio Boxing, Yoga, Latin Dance and Zen Energy.Activities include Warm Up, Stack Up, Stomp It, Run the World, Wallbreaker and Jump Rope.  Run the World here is amazing...more about that later.Workouts include Cardio, Arms, Abs, Toning, Back, Sports Prep, Glutes, Health and LegsI jumped right into the Run the World and have to say this is fantastic!  You run in place in various cities around the world and jog by landmarks.  To keep the run interesting, you are monitored for speed (how quickly your knees are moving) and given challenges throughout the run including \"\"high knees\"\" and speed challenges.  Along the way, you pass makers regarding the landmarks and a color photo pops up with the training giving you a brief history lesson or fact about it.  Very cool.The recognition on sit-ups went very well, with push-ups still a little off for me.  I may have been doing something wrong, but it is the by far the best recognition of push-ups for me of any game I've used before.  During your training the background will change and spice it up which was also a nice feature.One final item that didn't change that seemed to bother a lot of previous players was that there is really no defined way to exit the game or button to push.  You still have to get to the pause menu or use your controller to go to the dashboard.  If someone can figure out where to input/update the current weight and pass that along, I would greatly appreciate it.All in all, I have to say that I'm very impressed with the new version as I believe they've really worked on making it a great workout game that is much improved from the first one.**Later in the day edit**I think they have hit a home run with this game.  The jump rope section is like crack!  It's guitar hero, except with your feet.  An absolute blast and fun for the whole family! (without getting them addicted to crack, of course)  :)I also did the Boot Camp initial workout and was pretty dang tired after doing it, and I'm really no slouch.  The only issue with that was the trainer just started going into movements so you miss a few the first time.  But seriously, the background changes through a military theme throughout.LOVING IT!!\"", "\"Before playing this Kinnect title, make sure you got room because you will move...a lot!There are dozens and dozens of different cardio, strength and aerobic exercises.  All you have to do is follow your virtual instructor on screen as he/she is standing next to your real-life virtual image.  Some strength exercises might need dumbbells, but they are not really necessary.  There are also dance lessons(latin, hip-hop, etc...)There is also a calorie counter after every session that requires you to SMASH it in order to go on.  There is a belt system that keeps you going as you progress.  While calorie counter can be a tad inaccurate at times, it is a good \"\"ballpark\"\" indicator to see how much you've burned.  Most of sessions require you to follow the movements on the screen which sometimes do not get captured correctly, but if you wont let that bother you, Your Shape will be a great fitness companion to you.\"", "\"I've had this game since December and have had the opportunity to play all of the various options on the game.  Hands down, this is money well spent.  No matter what type of exercise you are in the mood for, or no matter what level of fitness you are at, you will find something to fit your needs.My favorite game on the disc is \"\"Run the World\"\".  I've found, at least for New York, if you run each section of the city, then the option for all of the sections back-to-back, you will be running a 5K.  Perfect way to cross train and strengthen calve muscles.  There are also mini challenges within the running that make the time go by quickly as well as a map to see where you are in the course.I also really enjoy the Kick `em  game.  You have to kick soccer balls into various targets.  So much fun.A surprise for me was the Bollywood dance, which I enjoyed far more than I thought.There are also muscle specific workouts that you can add weight to.These are extremely challenging yet still fun.For stretching there is Yoga and \"\"Zen\"\", which is kind of like Tai Chi.This game is literally a complete workout system that is fun and challenging.My only complaint is that sometimes the screens are hard to maneuver through when selecting options, especially for someone left handed. Once I got the hang of it, I was fine.I rate this 5 stars and would recommend it to others.\"", "And she really loved it, now she has been working out avery now and then, and monopolizing the TV set... But at least she is having a blast, now i do have an excuse to buy the next gen consoles ^^", "\"Your Shape Fitness Evolved 2012Fitness Evolved 2012 really shows off the Kinect technology. It \"\"scans\"\" your body at the start to project a real-time model of yourself into the game. I was eating a bowl of ice cream at the start and I could see my avatar holding the bowl of ice cream in the game. It doesn't scan/render my head/hair correctly though and I don't have a funky hairdo. The tracking is nearly accurate all the time, I only had a few instances where it didn't seem to register my movements correctly in Zen/Yoga and brick breaking.There are a lot of exercises in this game, some are broken down by difficulty and stages. There's even a personalized fitness program that recommends exercises based on what you want to achieve. You don't have to follow it, and can tailor it however you desire.The running and jump rope games seemed interesting at first, but they're essentially games that require you to run in place (lift knees higher for more speed) or jump in place (coordinate with the footprints on the screen). The stomp it had an interesting premise but I had to be really coordinated and the calorie burn rate was minimal.My favorite events are balancing a platform with boxes falling down  (strengthens core muscles), brick/wall breaking, cardio kickboxing, and Zen energy. Cardio kickboxing starts off slow but it builds you up quickly and the full-speed exercises are a lot of fun. I was definitely sweating big time after each event and have felt improvements in my core muscles, legs, and arms. The Zen Energy combines Yoga with Tai Chi. The really great part about Fitness Evolved 2012 is the computer trainer. She will make suggestions in real-time and provide audio/visual cues on what to do next. Games like Just Dance 4 and Zumba Fitness Core may provide visual cues but it's not always that useful. Fitness Evolved 2012 is not just about matching the movements, but doing the movements correctly with assistance and practice, as well as using calories as a performance metric.The core, abs, and other focused training events work exceptionally well. The crunches and other ab work that requires you to lie down on the floor somehow track accurately in Kinect. Although I do have a 8 foot space from the Kinect in my living room.There's quite a few pay-to-play DLC in this game, including one that requires you to buy a Gatorade G02 bottle to scan in order to unlock. I won't be buying any of the DLC or the Gatorade because the existing events are fine as-is. I didn't see anything that made me want to go out and spend Microsoft points or money to purchase.Remember to load the Kinect Playfit app for Xbox so you can get more achievements by burning calories, as Fitness Evolved 2012 is a compatible game.Overall: 5/5 stars, my favorite fitness game for Kinect with many fun and useful training exercises. Cardio kickboxing and Zen Energy are my favorites!\"", "We found this Kinect game to be an effective way of getting in shape without having to leave your house.  There is a wide variety of exercises available, and there are also dance classes available such as Hip-Hop dance and Bollywood dance.If you don't want to get involved in an advanced dance routine, you can do the simple cardio exercises.  They involve various environments, so it adds some flavor.  For example, we really enjoyed Wallbreaker- where you punch and kick bricks that appear on the screen.  There is also a running course that goes through various large cities.The calorie counter in the corner is nice, as seeing the number adds motivation.  The other nice thing is that you do not need any equipment other than the Xbox and Kinect sensor to use the game.The one negative we did find is that the Kinect system refused to recognize my wife.  So she had to play as a beginner every time she used it, which got annoying due to the intro tutorials.  There is no way to skip past them.While I prefer going to the gym or exercising outdoors, this is a nice backup plan for when you want to exercise at home.", "I have tried Wii Fitness with the balanced board in the past and it was fun.  But since the Kinect came out, it's so much easier than holding the controller, etc.  The Kinect just sees what your doing without any other objects in your hands.  It's really a great technology.  Anyways, I would rate this one just as good as the Wii Fitness one.  It's a toss up between the two, but this one definitely pushes you more.  So if your looking to lose weight, play this game every morning or every night for a year and you will lose weight efficiently, no doubt.  The more it hurts, the better it is for you is my slogan.  Anyways, try this game out.  Get a Yoga mat, they really help.  I think you also need weights if you want to do some sections, which is annoying but luckily I have a few weights that are low in lbs.  Get this game you won't regret it.  It will make you feel tons better.", "This kinect game really works you out. This work out game and different fitness that burns and helps you excerising I found rhe workouts to be hard, especially the boot camp work out. I have been using this game every morning since I have gotten it . I also feel the burn doing the jump rope work out.", "In terms of fitness related video games, I've tried both Nike Fit (an old PS2 eye toy game) as well as Wii Fit. I've also used p90x, finishing two 3 month runs of the program.UPDATE: I think programs like p90x is better for overall fitness. Why? Because they have better emphasis on training with weights, which in my case lead to much faster weight loss. Cardio and light weight training just isn't enough. Still I feel that this product is a great start and it can substitute for times when I need cardio.Here are the overall points that I've found with the game when comparing it to the alternatives:[Good]This isn't really a video game. It's a work out program.There is a good variety in the workouts, and you can add more workouts through DLC. As of now I've added about 8 different workout DLC from Xbox Live. I really like the fact that the game can be expanded. Even with stuff like p90x, it does get boring after a while. Constant variety is a good thing. My only question is: can I import the DLC and old workouts into next year's Your Shape Fitness?  I wouldn't want to waste them if I upgrade next year, assuming a new version comes out.Freedom: You can mix and match workouts in what ever combination you want. Depending on what goal you selected in beginning, Your Shape will place a blue flag next to the workouts that are recommended for achieving your goal. This also has a bad side which I'll detail in the 'Bad' section below.Some of the workouts can be fun like the dancing portions and the jumping rope mini game, the most of them are pretty standard DVD or TV show workouts.The workouts can be intense if you like. Specifically the Gatorade workout as well as the Bootcamp segment are pretty good for it.  In my opinion it's a good p90x alternative.I do really like having feedback on whether or not my form is good. I think this is what makes Your Shape unique. It's the closest thing to having a personal trainer. It does a decent job at tracking your overall body movements, but it's not perfect. I have more details about the flaws in the 'Bad' sectionIt's great not having to log my workouts anymore. It does a decent job at tracking statistics such as estimated calories burned.The way you control the menu is just awesome. It's actually better than Microsoft's Kinect menu which is surprising. So instead of hovering over a button and waiting for the circle to complete, to signify selecting it, with YourShape all you have to do is push a button. I'm not sure why Microsoft couldn't figure this out for the main 360 Kinect menu(s).The DLC provides a set of scheduled workouts if you don't want to think about which activities you want to choose.It's relatively cheap if you just buy the main game, especially when you compare it to the alternatives like p90x.It's nice to pair video game achievements with the workout. It's a great motivator.[Bad]It's not really a video game, so it's not as fun as a normal video game. It's a workout program pure and simple.The way the game tracks your movement is not 100% accurate, but it's still pretty good compared to past attempts with camera accessories. Like everything else with Kinect, I'm sure this depends a lot on lighting and how your living room is set up. Currently there are certain workouts that just can't tell where my arms are positioned. I'm not sure how this game misses that my arms are down in certain workouts.While there are a lot of workouts that last more than 3-4 minutes, it would be nice if I can save a playlist of workouts. Right now I have to pick one, finish, then pick another. This kills both my time and my flow. When I'm working out, I just want to get it done and not have to think about it. This is something p90x has. It gives you a list of workouts and you just do it and get results.There is one soccer based workout that you need to unlock with a specific Gatorade bottle, a very specific Gatorade bottle; and not just any G2 bottle will do. You need a 'G Series Fit' bottle. I live in a big metro and we cannot find this bottle in the big chain grocery stores. In fact I can't even find it on Amazon, even though they have over 200 different Gatorade drink products. This annoys me enough to tempt me to knock off another star. I don't mind advertising (like the Humana branded workouts) or even buying a product to lessen the upfront cost of this game, but that aforementioned product needs to be available for me to buy. I feel like I'm searching for the Holy Grail. I don't really care which company is at fault, PepsiCo (who owns Gatorade) or Ubisoft. I just think this was a really extremely poorly executed idea that just makes me angry.Just like p90x, there are a lot of exercises in Your Shape that you can't really do if you live above the first floor of an apartment or condo, unless you have really nice neighbors in the floor below you. You will be jumping and stomping around a lot.I would like more detailed statistics that are logged.It can't seem to detect either my hair or my feet if i'm not wearing shoes. My image on the screen looks like a weird freaky blob. I would really prefer that they just captured my body, and just make everything on it one solid color like Green Man on It's always sunny in philadelphia.The DLC is expensive considering what you get. Still, it is cheaper than workout programs like p90x (if you don't count the cost of the 360 and kinect) and I guess it makes up for the low up front price.I really don't like the UPlay integration. It feels really tacked on.I think Ubisoft needs to provide the option of choosing a different workout moderator. While the default voice is great for a home theater, it doesn't get me motivated enough like p90x's trainer. Specifically normal trainers talk a lot more, for both motivation and good to know info. Sadly I don't think this is possible with this generation of Xbox's since not all of them have a hard drive. I think a lot the problems with this game are due to the limitations Xbox's hardware.While weights are in Your Shape, the focus is clearly on cardio, which is fine but it's not for everyone.For the segments involving weights, there's really no information on how much you should lift or anything related to safety; which to me is a bit strange. Then again as I've already mentioned the focus is on cardio.[Misc]To fully experience this app, you need a hard drive. I didn't list this in the Bad section since this isn't Ubisoft's fault. Every 360 should have a hard drive. This problem stems from Microsoft.Some workouts make use of free weights.[Verdict]This game has a great future. I would recommend it even with its flaws. Overall I think this is a good way to prepare for real workout programs like p90x, or for adding variety if you're bored with your current program. I think Your Shape can only be a full substitute once you have good discipline.I've gotten pretty fat again lately, so I will be putting this game to the test, and I'll be comparing the results to p90x. I'll update the review once I'm finished.UPDATE: So far I don't think this is a complete replacement for exercise programs like p90x. However I feel that this is a great gateway for those programs, as well as a good way to get variety.", "What do I mean by too advanced??? too many squats and lunges (primarily in Cardio Boxing, which is my favorite). I've played around with YSF 2012 for a few hours, and I must say it's a big improvement, but sometimes I think Ubisoft is slow. The formula for the first YSF was very good, and this one is better, but the main issues were still not addressed. For instance, if I'd like to have a long cardio boxing workout without squatting, I have only 2 choices. I either have to choose the beginner class over and over, or choose the advanced course and get only half the credit for only punching. As someone who was really into bodybuilding, I know that squats and lunges (legs in general) are the hardest group of muscles to work out. At least, there could be a system incorporated in which you can get credit for a partial squat, but there isn't. This will turn a lot of elderly people off, and people who aren't in shape. I wish Ubisoft would catch on, and realize that some people will never advance to the level of performing lunges and squats.Overall, it's a lot better than the first installment, and I mean A LOT better in regards to fun and moving from one menu to the next. The biggest improvement is definitely in the Wallbreaker and Stack 'Em Up activities. It's a worthy purchase, but I still believe there needs to be more of a fun factor which is missing, but was present inWalk It OutorThe Fight: Lights Out. Working out by yourself in front of a TV should be EXCITINGLY fun, and I think this workout is more fun than its predecessor, but still isn't a blockbuster must have. (Believe me, Walk it Out, The Fight Lights Out,the biking in Wii Sports Resort, and even the previous Ubisoft titleGold's Gym Cardio Workouthad me hooked for months.)Overall, for the right price, it's a worthy purchase.", "\"Your average athletic video game will always be better suited to those of us that really would rather relax on the couch than bench press it. At least, I know that to be the case for me. But I have to say that, in this case, I really do feel that \"\"Your Shape; Fitness Evolved 2012\"\" really gives you a good workout and lots of exercise options for the retail price.I bought my Xbox 360 with Kinect this summer with the intention of using it as a hands-free exercise tool. I've got a Wii already, and, while I DO still enjoy exercising/dancing around on a few games with it, I've really enjoyed using my Xbox and Kinect to give me a thorough, fun workout.Dance Central with 240 Microsoft PointsandDance Central 2are great, fun ways to get your body moving, but there's no dedicated, clearly defined move that's clearly identified as targeting specific muscles in any dance game that I've encountered, much as we all know that they'll get you moving and sweating while still having fun and toning muscle.With YSFE 2012, there's a wide range of exercises to choose from, from runs through different venues in New York City that really ARE pretty accurately gauged as far as exertion and effort are concerned, to true cardio and strength training exercises (in small doses, which is perfect to build on if you're in for a nice, long, thorough workout), and right on to dance routines that'll satisfy those dance game cravings, while giving you a cultural experience via the dance style and country that it originates from, along with the appropriate music (I, personally, can't get enough of the Bollywood dance routines).The tracking in this game seems much better to me than what the original \"\"Your Shape: Fitness Evolved\"\" delivered, and considering that I'm struggling with the same space issues as many other Kinect users out there (and the Zoom's ineffectiveness helped nothing), I'm sure that most users will get lots of enjoyment from the software tweaking that seems to have been applied here (what I'm saying is, if your living room isn't the size of a castle dining hall, no worries with this game, thankfully)!!!I was SO excited to receive this game, open it up, and try it out, and thankfully, it didn't disappoint! I don't think you can go wrong here! Another great, active game to add to your collection, and work in to your regular workout!\"", "\"The original Your Shape: Fitness Evolved provided an excellent showcase of what the Kinect was capable of in regards to fitness and exercise. Its motion detection was revolutionary in terms of how well it detected how well you were performing exercises, and the mini-games it included were both tons of fun and moderately good exercise.I'm happy to say that Your Shape: Fitness Evolved 2012 does push the platform forward, in an evolutionary if not a revolutionary way. Still, it is by far the best \"\"pure workout\"\" game that you can get on the Kinect.When you start out the game,  you see a blue screen which adjusts the sensor and detects who you are. You're then brought to a home screen, where you see a stylized cartoon image of yourself. That's right, there's no need to create an avatar, because you ARE the avatar. This little change was a huge improvement over the first version, where you played as a brightly colored silhouette. It makes a world of difference, because now you can see your limbs and your body position much clearer than before and match them against the on-screen trainer.  More on that below.The home screen shows a number of different counters: medals won, badges won, and percent of content you've played through. On the right you can see the total number of calories you've burned playing the game. I do like the fact that there are clear milestones and targets to aim for, which will keep you coming back to the game. (One question a lot of people have is--did Ubisoft fix the annoying bug from the first version where it'd lose track of which sessions you've finished in a given routine. The happy answer is yes--now, no matter what order you do the exercises in the system will keep accurate track of which ones you've completed).At the main menu, you have a variety of choices which are color-coded into categories. The blue icons represent your tools. You can keep track of your overall progress, set objectives and take a fitness quiz so the system can recommend specific workouts for you, or go online to share your progress with the community. I do like that they made the fitness test optional in this version, so those who want to can just jump into the exercises.There are three remaining categories: Yellow icons represent \"\"Activities\"\", which are mini-games. Red icons represent \"\"Workouts\"\" which are traditional generic calisthenics and strength building exercises of the kind you might find at a gym. Finally, purple icons represent \"\"Classes\"\", which are essentially themed Workouts.Under the yellow \"\"Activities\"\", you have the following mini-games:1) Wallbreaker: This is essentially the same game as \"\"Virtual Smash\"\" in last year's version. In it, you have to punch across your body to hit blue blocks that appear next to your virtual character's body. The more blocks you punch accurately and quickly, the higher your multiplier will go up and the more a grid behind you will fill up--fill it up completely and it'll collapse. As you get to higher levels you'll have to kick blocks as well and avoid red blocks and giant anvils swinging at you. Even though this is basically a rehash of last year's version, it's still immensely fun, and the fact that you're controlling \"\"you\"\" and not just a silhouette of you adds a certain dimension to the game. I'd rate this one a 4 of 5 for workout intensity and a 5 of 5 for fun.2) Stack 'Em Up: This one is essentially the same game as the game from last year's version called...\"\"Stack 'Em Up\"\". This is the one where you're holding a plank and trying to catch and balance blocks that are falling from the sky. There are some new twists this year--to make your bar longer you have to raise a leg in the air. Also, the blocks come in different sizes, and they can even turn into ice or catch on fire (you need to kick a giant water drop to make it rain). Interestingly, I found the graphics of last year's version much clearer than this year's, especially when it tells you where to drop your blocks. This one gets a 3 of 5 for workout intensity and a 5 of 5 for fun.3) Run the World: Ah, finally something brand new. This is an activity where you \"\"run in place\"\". But there's a twist. You can choose either New York or London and basically \"\"run through\"\" the city from landmark to landmark. When I first heard about this one, I was excited--I thought it might be a virtual reality experience where you could literally run through actual streets (if this sounds outlandish, remember that the technology is already there with Google Maps and Bing Maps, not to mention driving games that have mapped out those cities' streets). But in reality, the experience was much less impressive than that. You basically just run in place on a blank white screen following a line of stylized \"\"yellow dots\"\" on the road. As you run, you do see buildings to your left and right, but they're just generic grey outlines. As you \"\"approach\"\" a famous landmark you'll see that building's distinctive outline, see a tiny photo of the building, and read some trivia about it. Note also that the distances you run are not literal--I'm quite familiar with downtown New York, and there's no way you can run from 40 Wall Street to the Woolworth Building to City Hall in 5 minutes. Still, I did like how the system was able to detect how fast I was \"\"running\"\" and how at least captured the feeling of running through a city. Overall, this activity definitely made what was otherwise a tedious activity pretty interesting. Workout intensity of this one was a 5 of 5, but for fun I give it a 3 of 5.4) Jump Rope: This is another new activity, and it's a winner. It's a twist on jump rope. You start out by holding your hand as if you're holding a jump rope, and an energetic beat will start playing. You'll see icons of two feet under you, and need to jump to the beat while matching the pattern of feet (either two close together, two far apart, or just the left or the right). Even on Easy mode I was wiped out after this one, but I found it immensely fun. 5 of 5 for workout intensity, 5 of 5 for fun.5) Stomp It: This game is very similar to \"\"Light Race\"\" from last year's version, where you stand in the middle of something similar to a \"\"Simon\"\" game and move your feet to correctly hit the colored panels under your feet. This year, they've improved it by matching the colored lights to a beat and give you a visual cue of which panel will light up next, so it's more like a step aerobics exercise (versus  last year's version where you were just randomly stomping). You still need a ton of room for this one, and if your Kinect doesn't have a clear view of your feet at all times it's not going to be fun for you at all. This one was a 4 of 5 for intensity, and a 4 of 5 for fun.\"\"Workouts\"\", represented by the red icons, are basically traditional calisthenics, cardio, and strength building types of activities that a trainer would do with you at a gym. The workouts are categorized by the part of the body or the exercise goal you want to focus on. They include the following (the number of exercise routines under each is in parentheses):1) Arms (12)2) Abs (13)3) Cardio (10)4) Toning (9)5) Back (12)6) Sports Preparation (8)7) Glutes (12)8) Health (3)9) Legs (12)They've got all the basic exercises covered pretty well. For example, when I selected the first workout under \"\"Arms\"\", the exercises were knee push-ups and slow mountain climbs. A typical exercise under \"\"Abs\"\" will have you doing all kinds of crunches, from basic crunches, to V knees to the chest, to up and down planks.As in the first version, to the left of the screen you'll observe your virtual trainer doing the exercise, using the proper technique. You'll see an image of yourself to the right of the trainer. I really liked how the cartoon trainer and the cartoony you looked very similar, both in terms of size and visual style.  As I said, new to this version is the ability to see your arms and legs clearly, so you can work on matching the trainer's body position and moves precisely. There are also visual cues that'll show you exactly where your head should be and where your feet should be. Finally, there's music so that you can time your reps to the beat perfectly (you'd be surprised at how many workout games just play random music and don't bother to match it to your reps).A woman's voice will talk your through all the exercises, calling out instructions and encouragement. Regarding the latter, I found that she tended to err a little on the \"\"overly encouraging\"\" side--even when I wasn't doing the exercises right, she'd be shouting out compliments and encouragement. Happily, the motion detection is definitely spot-on--after the workout you'll see precisely what percentage of the workout you nailed, and I found it to be remarkably accurate.\"\"Classes\"\", represented by the purple icons, are very similar to workouts. You go through a series of set exercises, you have a virtual cartoon trainer who will demonstrate the proper moves, and you'll control the cartoony \"\"you\"\" standing next to him or her as you try to match the moves. The difference is that while \"\"workouts\"\" were like generic exercises you might do at the gym, \"\"classes\"\" all follow a specific theme, such as a certain style of dance, a boxing training session, and even a military bootcamp. Here are the options and the number of routines in each:1) Africa Rhythms (12)2) Boot Camp (6)3) Hip Hop (12)4) Cardio Boxing (14)5) Destination: Bollywood (12)6) Yoga (4)7) Latin Dance (12)8) Zen Energy (8)I tried the boot camp one first. Sure enough, you and your virtual trainer (a gruff drill sergeant) are in the field of a military boot camp complete with a helicopter and occasional explosions happening around you. Even at the easy levels, you're taken through a grueling set of exercises, from running to \"\"Olympian squats\"\" to \"\"stun attacks\"\" to push ups. The trainer stays in character throughout, shouting instructions to you amid various random interjections (\"\"you're tired? I don't care!\"\", \"\"does it hurt? Good!\"\").I also tried the Bollywood one. Like the rest of the dance-themed classes, it had different levels with names like \"\"Learn it\"\", \"\"Rehearse It\"\", \"\"Speed It Up\"\", and \"\"Show it Off\"\". I tried the beginning level, and it brought me through some very authentic Bollywood dance steps with names like \"\"Bolly Arms\"\", \"\"Aarti Step\"\" and \"\"Blossom Step\"\". The moves were very authentic. I wouldn't say this part of the game is exactly Dance Central, but it's not bad either.Overall, I'd say this is a worthwhile purchase if you're serious about using your Xbox for fitness and exercise. Those who purchased last year's version (especially if you purchased a lot of the DLC) may find a lot of what's in this year's version redundant. But I'd say there are enough improvements to make it a worthwhile purchase. I loved the improved avatar, enjoyed the new activities they added, and appreciate the fact that they didn't skimp this year on the number of exercises you can do before resorting to purchasing more as downloadable content. From the title, I'm assuming Ubisoft intends to release one of these every year; here's hoping that they continue to innovate the series moving forward and don't get lazy and rest on past laurels.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.08989604562520981, 0.1348501592874527, 0.1001313328742981, 0.0037637632340192795, 0.11267639696598053, 0.05588909983634949, 0.06822943687438965, 0.11646970361471176, 0.0916222482919693, 0.006707033142447472, 0.05383548513054848, 0.07145442813634872, 0.09447485208511353]]}
