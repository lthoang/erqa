The servers went through a multitude of problems on launch day, the day after launch, a few rolling restarts and server/game crashes.  However, being one of the most anticipated games of 2012, beating out Mass Effect 3, Max Payne 3, and probably all but Black Ops II, I can assure you that it's worth the wait.The loot system is just as complex as before, the rune system is re-worked so no longer is it item based, it now adds an additional effect to a skill, making certain abilities better for solo play, or group play.  Some abilities also are more useful depending on the difficulty.  Do you want to be a glass cannon on Hell or Inferno, or do you want to take reduced damage to kill longer?  Avoidance or Damage?  Heals or CC?  There are plenty of ways to play the game.  I wish that the game still allowed 8 players at a time, and who knows, maybe this feature will be re-implemented again in an expansion.How many people are going to be making Diablo 3 their next part time job come 5/22/12?  I think it's an interesting way to keep people playing, although I will have to laugh at the people that will actually pay money for an item you will never physically own other than in a video game.What Diablo 3 has done right:* Very easy to join games with your friends, open your Friends panel, right click the person, and invite or join to party.* No more having to worry about your characters getting deleted after 90 days of not playing them, or 2 hours in the first 48 hours of play.* The loot is still very complex and you will be scratching your head and seeing if this item is an upgrade* Skills are done to give diversity on how to play a class, no longer will you be forced to reroll if you screw up a talent point, or attribute wrong(Even though later patches in Diablo 2 fixed this)* Scaling difficulty the more people that play, that was a very good feature in Diablo 2 and made it a challenge and fun to kill Baal and Diablo in 8 player games by yourself.* No longer punished if you join games with people that are further along in quests.  You can play along with them and still progress.* Quest leeching, while it could be annoying in public games, at least it's an easy way to level up a noob without getting slaughtered.* Hardcore mode, definatly has the same feel as in Diablo 2.  This time around, expect people to die a lot easier if you don't stack Vitality along with your primary stats.* No USEast, USWest, it's all one.  There are still Asian servers, among others, that don't seem to have the issues the US Servers are having.* No Town Portal Scrolls, no ID scrolls(You still have to right click to ID Legendary and Rare items, but no longer do you have to waste inventory to do so, like in the Beta)* Achievements to up the replay value after you've gotten past Diablo 3 on Inferno with all 5 characters.* Being able to choose which quests to repeat, for missing books, side dungeons, or exploration puroses.* Banner porting and customization of your banner, the banner porting makes it VERY easy to get back in the game with your teammates that are rushing to complete quests rather than loot or take trips to town.*** The Collector's Edition, like all four Warcraft games, Warcraft 3, and Starcraft 2, feel like Collector's Editions.  If you didn't buy one for $99.99, have fun paying double.  You get the standard Soundtrack, Art Book, the making of Diablo 2, but the items that stand out, you get Angelic Wings, which make your characters stand out, you get a unique banner and sigil(If you played in the Beta), Diablo Skull and 4GB Soulstone Flash Drive glows red when in your computer!  It also comes with Diablo 2 and Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction(A $20 value) pre-loaded onto the flash drive, much like Starcraft 2 did with their Collector's Edition.What Diablo 3 has done wrong:* Always online DRM, not everyone has an internet connection, LAN and single player was a very big part of the success of Diablo 2, and well, some people don't want to play the game with other people.* Very limited chat channels, you have about 8 pre-set channels to join.  No more clan channels.* No guilds.  This is a feature that would greatly benefit players because it would be easier to communicate with your friends.* No guild halls with a stash, again, a great feature that would make it easier to give items to people in different time zones.* When Diablo 3 has to undergo maintenance, you can't play at all!  Single player should be allowed.* 4 Player games, I think 8 players would've done well, especially if everyone could complete every quest in a game even in different acts.A lot of people will knock Diablo 3 for various reasons, however, those same people will praise Diablo 3 for different reasons.  No games are perfect.", "The Collectors Edition is composed of:-An artwork book that is of high quality, the heft of this tome cannot be understated. The grand designs found within are evocative of the works of great doodle masters such as any of the artists working on South Park or Mrs. Havercamp, my third grade elementery school teacher.-A tchotchke (Diablo's head), which serves as a clever container for the USB memory stick containing the previous Diablo games and (oddly) also possesses a chemical smell much like spray paint. The tchotchke head and USB memory stick were quite obviously held in such high regard by Blizzard, that they were placed within their own container, packed carefully, much as you would expect to find a Rolex watch or perhaps a crown jewel or two.-Several guest key codes on laminated cards, that I can only surmise are collectors keepsakes in and of themselves.-A Music CD and 'Behind the Scenes' Video DVD are included; regrettably the Music CD is packaged in a very thin plastic case, which in turn is encapsulated within a cardboard paper case. I am hesitant to open this as the extraneous cover is likely to become easily worn out.-Of course the game DVD itself comes, as would be expected, in the standard DVD style enclosure that is characteristic of any DVD sold. Included within this caissonThe outer box is not made of real ivory or bone after all, so I am disappointed that the box itself is not an heirloom that I will be able to pass on to my grandchildren. However, it is made of precision manufactured steam compressed wood pulp that seems to be very robust, and I am grateful for that much.Unlike the Diablo II Collectors Edition, which I am also the proud owner of, this collector edition does not seem to have a serial number stamped on the back of the box. My Diablo II box is stamped 43,xxx of 75,000. There is a number stamped on the bottom of the box, but since it is in the 7 million range, it is almost certainly the part number for the box itself.The complete package is most impressive due to its weight, in large part a result of the hard cover artwork book inside. The box is also quite large. I thought the Diablo II box had a bit too much girth, as if Blizzard felt that a typical box size of that era would be unable to do justice to the variety of contents it was comprised of. The voluminous capaciousness of the Diablo III box is an order of magnitude greater. Precisely placed at the bottom of this portmanteau of joys is a finely crafted piece of injected molded plastic, which very deftly holds in place all of the contents. In all, the package is a great achievment, and one can not help but give kudos to the artisans that brought together all of these wonders in one tidy package for the world to enjoy.I would like to review the game, but unfortunately Battle.net doesn't seem to be functioning as intended by the manufacturer of this masterpiece. Perhaps one day in the future this will be possible.", "When I first heard about Diablo 3 I wasn't looking for much. Just a solid update to and improvement upon Diablo 2, the game that I and all of my friends spent hours everyday playing when we were kids and is lauded as one of the best of its generation. Blizzard didn't really take the &#34;Don't fix what ain't broken approach&#34; entirely to heart because they pretty much re-did everything from the ground up. Some of the changes were for the better but in my opinion most of it was for the worse.StoryThe story is largely predictable and frankly just not very engaging. I didn't particularly care about any of the characters nor did I ever care about the main plot events. It just was very formulaic for a action-adventure RPG to the point of being cliche. Most of the quests really felt like chores more than anything else, and there were only a few very cool moments that asked you to do something different. I think Blizzard sort of was resting on their laurels and hoping the Diablo name would sell their game, but contemporaries have caught up and I could easily recommend a variety of other action-adventure RPGs that offer a far more engaging story. The first time I was playing the game I felt like I was playing it mostly to finish it to keep going to the higher difficulties where all the loot is.GameplaySo what Blizzard did this time around in what I believe is an effort to make Diablo 3 easier to pick up for new players is to take out point allocation and skill upgrades from the players hands. What this means is that whenever you gain a level your points  are automatically picked for you based on your class (barbarians get more to strength, wizards get more points placed in intelligence). Same goes for skills, so you don't pick what skills/skill trees you want to focus on like in most other RPG games. They automate the whole thing for you. I think they did this so you can focus on just messing around with different skills and not how to &#34;plan out&#34; or &#34;focus&#34; your character.Good idea in theory, but in practice what this means is there's really nothing unique about your character at all besides the gear they have. Gear becomes the #1 most important thing in the entire game regardless of what character you are and what class you are. Damage for all the classes is directly tied to weapon damage, so whether you're a witch doctor or a barbarian you need to find the biggest item you can carry. The skills between the classes themselves are diverse enough, and there are some genuinely cool and fun attacks you can use with each of the classes. I especially like the barbarian seismic slam and the wizard's slow time abilities, but eventually the novelty wears off. This is about the 1 redeeming area of the game and there is 1 golden period when you have decent gear, the enemies aren't ridiculously strong, and the game feels balanced and you can just focusing on slaughtering the demonic hordes as a hero. Definitely had some great times in this golden period, but alas it doesn't last very long. So you'd think then that if gear is so important Blizzard would have a efficient system to keep players engaged and competitive with loot right? You'd be wrong.The Loot SystemWeapon and Item drops in Diablo 3 have to have probably some of the worst mechanics I've ever seen. I've played the game on and off since it came out, and put in probably a good couple hundred hours overall with most of them spent on the higher difficulty levels. To date I have not found a single Legendary item during the entire time I've played the game. This is not uncommon either, there are plenty of forums on blizzard with players complaining about just this. This could be because I don't have enough &#34;magic find&#34;, but eventually after gaining enough nephalem valor (extra magic find after you beat a champion monster mob) I'd expect at some point in the game to get at least one legendary item. Out of the stuff you do find, most of it is junk or you can't even use it. I regularly find wands that give +100 strength or maces that give +100 intelligence when I play with my wizard. What kind of sense that does make to you? On the off chance I do find something decent, it's usually something for an entirely different class. So why did Blizzard put in such a non-sensical system? To promote the auction house of course.Blizzard's auction house is their way to regulate trades and create a economy where they always come out the winner at everyone's expense. Prices are always ridiculously high, with most of the decent items costing millions of gold (trust me, that'll take you a while to get unless you find something decent to sell or spend a lot of time gold farming). Whether people are buying stuff in the gold auction house or the real-money auction house Blizzard gets a cut of the profits. And the money you may get from the real-money auction house can only be used to get more Blizzard stuff, unless you're willing to give up even more of a cut to blizzard to get it out through paypal. Whatever option you pick, Blizzard wins, kind of like a Casino actually.MultiplayerPlaying with other people is managed decently when you're working through the campaign, except that difficult scaling becomes a issue when not everyone is at the same level. Weaker players in the party will have a tougher time and might not be having much fun because they're just too weak to really kill anything (probably due to their lack of good gear thanks to the poor loot system), and the stronger players in the party will just feel overpowered. The other big downside is that your &#34;magic find&#34; (probability increase in finding better items) is averaged across your party. So if you're playing with someone that doesn't have much magic find but you have a lot, you're going to end up with a lower probability of finding good items and he'll be better off with you. Kind of encourages you in that sense to play on your own to maximize your chances of finding decent items. Competitive multiplayer is still non-existent, with no real ETA on delivery from Blizzard. Though at this point there's no reason to wait since a) most of the people still playing will have 10x better gear than you do meaning you're probably going to lose because you didn't spend enough money/time/energy into hunting for items as they did.ConclusionThere's a reason my entire friends list completely dried up within a month. I logged in a few days back to see if anyone was still playing, all it showed was that no one had logged in since the end of the first month. I even created a public game to see if anyone would join, and after a few hours I gave up waiting and quit. To it's credit Blizzard has been trying to respond to feedback and improve the game. They decreased the difficulty level in Inferno mode, put in new game mechanics, and generally have tried to improve the game with tweaks. Maybe they have mitigated a number of the problems raised thus far, but a quick look at the forums tells me that's hoping for too much. At the end of the day Diablo 3 is still broken on a very fundamental level that it is pretty much beyond repair. Diablo 3 is definitely not a worthy successor to Diablo 2, and at this point is not worth your time picking up and playing over all of the other great games out.", "\"GOOD:=====1. Great ValueThe CE comes with a good amount of stuff that makes you feel like you got your money's worth.  Specifically...2. Diablo 2/LOD (1920x1080!!) on USB DriveYou get D2/LOD on a funky 4GB USB drive shaped like a soulstone (that has a red LED light in it that lights up ominously when plugged in).  It's great, and to be quite honest, a better game than Diablo 3, but that's neither here nor there...  Also nice is that D2 plays full screen on my 1920x1080 23\"\" LCD monitor and looks pretty darn good.  I assume it's stretched to 16x9 aspect ratio, but if it is, you don't notice it and it doesn't look odd or unnatural.  Maybe it's my video card that's responsible, I don't really know.  In any case, it was a very nice addition since D2/LOD costs $20 separately.3. Unique In-game Angel Wings and DyesThe user account-tied \"\"artifacts\"\" are nice bonuses.  The angel wings are nice because it makes you stand out and looks pretty cool too.  The dyes are more standard stuff, white and black-ish (not quite totally black), that are useful because they can be used repeatedly without running out.  Totally aesthetic and not functional, but nice to have.4. Soundtrack CDIt would have been better if it was a multi-disc sountrack with D1 and D2 soundtracks included also (I prefer those more minimalist, moody scores to the overly bombastic score of D3), but that might be asking for too much.  As it is, it's nice to have the CD although I will probably never listen to it.  Minor quibble, but I hate the paper/plastic \"\"digipak\"\" CD case that is used instead of a standard plastic jewelcase with liner/notes.5. Making of DVDIt is 2-discs and has a lot of content, including many behind the scenes and development segments, many interviews, a variety of trailers (although minimal D3 trailers), storyboards, etc.  My favorite is the retrospective that is fairly short (~11min) but very interesting as it talks about the development of D1 and D2 also.  Interesting to hear that D1 was shopped to Blizzard initially and later that small company was acquired by Blizzard and turned into Blizzard North, which later got disbanded/dissolved around 2005 (not surpring how this affected how D3 turned out).  Also has all the cutscenes on it.6. Art BookIt's very hefty with thick, glossy pages and has nice artwork of the characters, locations, items, and other aspects of D3.7. Guest Passes for D3 and WoWNice touch for them to include a few guest passes so that your friends can give it a try if they are on the fence (as they should be, to be quite honest).BAD:====1. Smelly Diablo HeadWho would want that smelly, rubbery Diablo head?  I sure don't, and keep it safely tucked away in the box that (thankfully) keeps the horrid chemical smell safely sequestered inside.2. Digipak Soundtrack CaseAs mentioned previously, it would have been nice for the soundtrack to have a jewelcase with liner/notes packaging instead of a cheap \"\"digipak\"\" paper/plastic case.3. TrailersIt would have been nice to have more trailers from D1 and D2 on the making of DVD.OVERALL:========A great value overall with all the goodies they include with this CE.  Definitely worth the $40 over the standard edition release, although I don't know how much more than MSRP it would be worthGame: 1/5Collector's Edition: 4/5\"", "The first week I played this I was in love, but now I can't see myself every playing it again. It has absolutely no staying power, and quite frankly I find it as redundant as they come.", "Specifics to the Collector's Edition: all of the extra stuff is amazing! Worth the extra money. The demonic USB drive alone is worth it, this thing looks awesome! Here's all the goodies that came inside:Demonic USB drive including Diablo II and its expansionAn artbook (with lots of spoilers in it)A behind-the-scenes DVDA Diablo III soundtrack3 Diablo III guest passes, 1 WoW guest pass, and Diablo II codes for your Battle.net accountDiablo IIISo... all of this stuff is amazing. Enough said. On to the review!One word: Impressed. The wait for Diablo 3 has been very, very long with information being doled out slowly, but after playing it for a few hours, totally worth the wait. Let's break it down:The Story: Picking up some 20 years after the events of Dialo 2 the world of Sanctuary is more fleshed out than ever before. The NPCs, the interactions, the quests, the general feel of the world. You can tell that years have goen into the careful construction of the world. The purpose and direction are understood but that doesn't mean that you know what's going to happen. Stopping to write this review is hard, but, when I heard of all the 1 star reviews going up due to some temporary login issues I thought I'd hop on.Graphics: I'm playing on a top of the line iMac I bought last year and the game looks absolutely gorgeous. The graphics are incredibly crisp. Everything is very detailed and just seems to pop off the screen. It's been 12 years since the last Diablo installment and it shows. The game still has the LOOK of Diablo but it just looks so amazing. It's engrossing, to put it simply.Sound: Everything sounds great. I use simulated surround headphone and everything is exactly where it is supposed to be. The music is dark and ominous, the sounds of battle are sharp and exciting, and the happy noise of picking up some loot is always welcome.Overall, this is not just a game, it's an experience. Absolutely incredible and totally worth the wait. You've waited twelve years for this, so, what's a few hours more if you're having some issues. Once you're in, you'll forget all about the problems you've been having.Yes, I'm a Blizzard fanboy. I can't deny that in any way, haha. Still, if they disappointed me I'd be the first to point it out as well.They haven't.", "Basing a games worth because of server issues that were resolved same day is totally fair.  Heres my review.  Half way through act one, and its already better than torchlight II", "\"Honest review of Diablo 3.  I have not played any previous Diablo games, so this is new to me.  I own World of Warcraft and Starcraft 2. I enjoy Blizzard games and like the community.Diablo 3 is described as an action RPG; I would consider it a water down version of that. I consider an RPG along the lines of WoW and Skyrim.  There are some RPG elements like equipment customization, but not in character builds.  Your stats increase a set amount depending on the character you choose and you unlock specific skills at different levels.  The customization is that you choose what unlocked skills to use at any particular time. I have always enjoyed choosing what skill I wanted when I leveled up, I am not use to having it chosen for me. I understand why Blizzard did this, they wanted to make it easier to play and encourage new players.  However, what attracted me to buying Diablo in the first place was the customization that I read about for Diablo 2.  For me, customization and character builds comes before story in RPGs.  Even though this is disappointing the game is still enjoyable.  The random loot gives a good amount of customization, but leveling does not have the same satisfaction I am accustomed to.  The story is quite enjoyable and the cut scenes are fun to watch, they are timed to not  interfere with the gameplay.  I find the voice acting superb.The game play mechanics are easy to learn and use. The challenge comes in the timing and loads. Basically, you can assign abilities you have unlocked to both mouse buttons and numerical keys 1-4. I have heard complaints about this namely that players want access to all abilities and not limited to just six.  However, I find this adds to the challenge because you have to choose the right load out for the situation. It is easy to change and the cool down time is very short.Replay value of the game is there for at least a couple of play throughs with different characters, but may become boring after that.  Yes, loot drops are random and yes, some aspects of the dungeons are random as well, but if you are not into loot hunting and auction house whoring-the game could lose its appeal. Even with multiplayer players who are not trying to find the next great piece of equipment may get bored after a few play throughs.  At this point, I am not bored and playing with my second character. I am interested to see if there is money making opportunity with the \"\"real money\"\" auction house when it is up and running.  I think the lack of player controlled leveling customization may hurt long-term replay value though.I chose to give the game three stars for two reasons.  First, I marked off a star because of the watered down customization, this is a huge issue for me, but may not apply to everyone. I just feel long-term replay value may be hurt by this and past Diablo games have been known for replay value.I marked off a second star for the fact that you must have an internet connection to play single player.  This really does not affect me because I am always connected, but I believe players should have a choice. Battlenet is a double edge sword in my opinion. I like that I can login to any computer and easily download a game I already payed for and play anywhere. Currently I have WoW, Starcraft 2 and Diablo on numerous computers. I like the fact all I have to do is enter my account info and I am off. However, on the other side there is no resale value. I hardly sell games, but I believe it is a player's choice. You buy a car, house, gun, stereo, etc, you can choose to sell. I think games should be the same. Even though it does not really apply to me I stand by the community and thus, marked off a star.As far as the collectors edition is concerned A+, like all the extras. Blizzard always does a great job with these.\"", "Ok so with over 300 hrs logged in on a monk and DH, and a full month played I can safely and without a second thought, tell anyone who's thinking of buying this game?: DONT.Diablo 3 is essentially Blizzard's Real Money Auction House (RMAH) with a hack/slash/loot game built around it. Now, you may be telling yourself 'well I dont plan on using it, so no problem' ok that's fine. In fact, the game itself is fine for the 1st 3 levels of difficulty. Normal, Nightmare and Hell version of D3 work basically as intended: you fight, you level up, you loot. Everything is great, you feel powerful when you kill Diablo in Hell and now it's time for endgame: Inferno. 2 problems here.#1- The first 3 difficulties dont include the ONE factor that all but leave your characters 'broken' until you TOTALLY re-gear them (or quit in the frustration, more on that later), and this is: Resistances. There are many different types in the game, none of them you'll really feel until Inferno, where you WILL be greeted with one-shots. Many of them. Dozens of them.Now since the new patch that has GREATLY increased repair costs, you'll quickly find you have two options in inferno:1- Go back to Hell and farm until nauseous (which no one wants to do naturally)for appropriate gear, by aquiring 5 buff stacks for finding loot and then trying to find something in the ridiculously low drop rate of Hell... or(and how convenient)#2 go to the RMAH. The RMAH is where all the farmers in the game go to sell their items for outrageously high gold prices or for an equivalent cash value in USD. I'm not a complete idiot so Im not paying real cash for a fake sword or staff or whatever, so the route those who are still around on the server take is to simply do farming runs for cash and hope something drops in the process.This process can take days to find a decent piece of Inferno quality gear, farming for hours. 3 weeks in, my guys are still stuck in Act 1(inferno).There are many rumors about Blizz intentionally lowering the drop rate on level 61+ (Inferno level) gear, putting many into a 'pay or quit' scenario as the loot needed to progress simply isnt as available as it was in the 3 easier levels.There are also rumors of Blizz reps padding the AH with items only they can generate to sweeten the RMAH.Im glad I waited before writing this because before you hit Inferno, the game is fun. Well, fun enough to make you want a bit more and would have recieved 5s all around, but the frustration you'll face with the lack of resistances going into inferno, the one shots, the ever-looming repair bill over your head, the almost non-existence of upgradable loot at end game - and if Im not getting loot, why the hell am I playing this game- and the blatant RMAH always in your face, the honeymoon with this game ends real fast. A shame, it seems the last of the great AAA title makers has decided to put profit before their consumers once again.Dont buy.", "\"It's been so long since i've played Diablo 2 and D3 is more of a nostalgia type of game for me. I've already burned numerous hours on D3 and i feel i've invested my time wisely! I personally don't care about the \"\"must have internet\"\" to play feature, mainly cause you can find internet connections anywhere now a days. So the people complaining just have nothing else to do with their time then to down rate something they just don't understand how to play. It's okay though, those of us that are understanding and not bratty will enjoy the game and you all with miss out. Tough luck.Anyway!
