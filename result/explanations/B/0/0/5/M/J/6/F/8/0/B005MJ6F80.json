I have a small over the shoulder bag that I carry my everyday stuff in, that being my glasses, wallet, ipad mini and Lenovo Tablet 2 Windows 8 tablet (as I have to be able to be in contact with my clients).The problem is anything short of a 13 inch tablet you can not possibly type on the screen with any accuracy and still be able to see things on the screen - such as Outlook to book an appointment etc.I have gone through just about every keyboard. Microsoft bluetooth (too thick), Logitech bluetooth (too long), Lenovo bluetooth (too thick and long).Just needed a keyboard that was thin enough and long enough enough to match the Windows tablet itself!This keyboard does it! And as far as use, perfect. I am a 6'3 big guy with large fingers so using any small keyboard can be a challenge but the key spacing is perfect. Easy to use!Keyboard also has all the function keys as well as Windows 8 special keys which is needed for my use.As far as battery life, have not run out of a charge yet and for charging less than 1.0 amp USB is fine, so basically I can use a small power cube and charge both the Lenovo Tablet 2 and the keyboard at the same time if needed!Now make a good bluetooth mouse.... Finally resorted to the microsoft bluetooth travel mouse due to size but not the best.... Waiting to look at the Asus mouse, pad which has just been announced130823-Update. Having problems with key duplication - very frustrating..... Well I guess for the price only lasted 6 months", "Could not believe how nice this was for the price. Feels great, works well, connects very easily. Love it!My brother wants one now!", "Very thin and rechargeable, keys have a great feel and type amazingly, sometimes I use it instead of my own keyboard if I am feeling lazy as it is bluetooth capable.", "It's a perfectly fine, functional little keyboard, and I like that its rechargeable, but it's just not the same quality as the apple keyboard. It feels plasticy, the letters are not printed on the keys but are actually little stickers, and the feeling of pressing the keys is not as solid.", "\"Owned this keyboard since August 2012, and I love it...The user manual may not be up to par, or correct at all for that matter, but you bought this for the device, not the manual...This Perixx Periboard-804 pairs wonderfully with my:(1) Samsung Galaxy SII Epic 4G Touch (On Stock GingerBread, ICS, CyanogenMod10, and more.)(2) HTC Evo 3D (Stock ICS)(3) HTC EVO View Tablet (Stock Honeycomb)(4) My friend's iPhone 4(5) My friend's iPad(6) My cousin's Mac DesktopAs long as your device has Bluetooth-HID Support, it will work.... This works on practically all high-end Android & iPhones...This is listed as compatible with Android, iPhone, iPad, Mac, PC, and more, but it does... Your PC needs to have a Bluetooth Adapter or Built In Hardware, which can be purchased anywhere (including Amazon.com)...The shipping was fast on this product and I love it.Pros:- Works with many devices- Pairs Quickly- Great Size (About 80% of a Full Sized)- Keys Don't Stick- CTRL+A works on (Most Androids)- All Keys Functional- Keys Don't Stick- Battery Last 5-10hours+ Non Stop Use- Has On/Off Switch- Charges Conveniently (for Android Users) with a MicroUSB Cable (as most Android Devices have a MicroUSB Charging Port)- Comes With a Charger (Use your own charger to charge the device faster.)- Keys are easy to press- PRICECons:- The \"\"Carrying Case\"\" is nothing more than a simple carrying cloth, it will only protect from dust, (if that).- The Box won't make a good carrying case to put in and out of either.- The AC Wall Adapter that it comes with charges slow at 0.5A, so use your MicroUSB Charger Laying Around the House, if you have one...- Doesn't Have Backlit Keys (Oh well, turn the light on when you type)- Doesn't come with a mouse, or trackpad.This is more than worth your money, it works well with most devices, and I am so glad that I picked this up!If your keyboard's keys \"\"stick\"\", it is probably your cell phone... But it's a great product.\"", "Pros:- range is excellent- battery life is better than expected- works on crowded 2.4GHz band cleanly- light- great key feel- works with various Android and Linux devicesCons:- none that I have found.", "If you're looking for a portable keyboard to use with an Android device, this one should be a strong contender on first look.  It's light, robust, should connect to anything from Android 2.x on, and has pretty decent key feel and pitch for a compact portable keyboard.  It should be an ideal companion to a 7&#34; or larger Android tablet.Sadly, it seems to suffer from poor battery life, draining its battery in 30-45 minutes once powered on even if it spends most of that time sitting idle.  I understand there are obvious physical limitations to the size of battery that will fit into a device such as this one, but this seems unreasonably poor battery life.  It's only a keyboard; it's not as though it has to power a display backlight or a primary CPU.  The largest power drain should be the Bluetooth radio, and a reasonable-sized battery ought to power that all day.", "A great accessory for my phone and tablet when doing emails. Good battery life and light weight too. A good value.", "\"For the price this is a good bluetooth keyboard.  The build quality seems fairly good and I can type quite quickly using it.Pros:(1) So far I have paired and used it with no problems to a Windows 7 unit (HP TM2); an iOS5 unit (iPad) and an Android unit (Asus Transformer).  It worked well with each of them, including some of the function keys such as volume, etc.(2) I like the fact that it has a rechargeable battery that charges fully in about 2 hours with the included micro USB cable.  The other bluetooth keyboard I had used 2 \"\"aaa\"\" batteries which I never seemed to have on-hand.(3) It is quite compact and light which is needed since I plan to use this mainly when travelling.Cons:(1) It is kind of a pain that the on/off and connect switch are on the bottom of the unit instead of the top.  They also seem a bit finicky to use.(2) The decals on the keys (key markings) don't look like they will last too long, although I guess only time will tell.(3) I am typing this with the keyboard and although for the most part it is fine and responds well the space bar needs a slighty harder press to register....I'll get used to it but in the mean time it is slowing down my typing a bit.\"", "It is flat and very thin but that's what I was looking for.  I got the Pelican case for my iPad so I needed the thinnest possible one I could get.  I love that it's rechargeable rather than battery powered because I don't have to worry about having batteries around.  It synced up with my iPad3 with absolutely no issues.  I just went to settings, bluetooth, tapped on the device, input the number code it gave me and I was good to go in about a minute.  You do have to charge it for a couple of hours first and they do not provide an adapter so you can charge with an electrical outlet but I just used my Apple adapter that came with the iPad.  Not a problem.  I am a woman and have smaller hands and a man might have issues with the size of the keyboard but I am fine with it.  I love the smaller size because it fits in the case without purchasing the higher priced Apple keyboard.  It's very light too.  It does not come with a case for the keyboard, though, so it is just the keyboard and charging cable in the box.  I had no need for a keyboard specific case so I am fine with that.  Just a warning for those that might be.", "\"As the title says, this is a fantastic little keyboard. The feel is great, so thin, and the layout is first rate.  I have had many laptops with built in keyboards that did not feel nearly as good as this one.  Yes, the keyboard is a little small, but that does not take away from the quality and feel.  It is really nice to see a keyboard that says it's also a \"\"Windows keyboard\"\" that includes a \"\"delete key\"\" and a \"\"backspace key\"\", thank you for that.  Pairing was a snap (just follow the instructions), the initial battery charge was just as described (2 hours. This purchased is totally without regret, so far. I would love to see Perixx expand this line of products.  Maybe a little larger keyboard, with backlighting?  Just do not change the quality and feel. Keep up the good work...\""], "Gamma": [0.053615983575582504, 0.05364462733268738, 0.05364462733268738, 0.05364953726530075, 0.05363848805427551, 0.053159795701503754, 0.05364462733268738, 0.05364462733268738, 0.054194215685129166, 0.05364462733268738, 0.05364462733268738, 0.05364462733268738, 0.05364462733268738, 0.05364462733268738, 0.05364462733268738, 0.14165106415748596, 0.05364462733268738], "Beta": [[0.00025897700106725097, 0.1640269011259079, 0.20008057355880737, 0.03726436570286751, 0.0001476959587307647, 0.0024006434250622988, 0.007863372564315796, 0.1754450500011444, 0.165073424577713, 0.2033495008945465, 0.04408949613571167], [0.000258605316048488, 0.164043590426445, 0.20009860396385193, 0.037249162793159485, 0.0001474859454901889, 0.002397761447355151, 0.007864008657634258, 0.17542695999145508, 0.16508804261684418, 0.20336104929447174, 0.0440647229552269], [0.000258605316048488, 0.164043590426445, 0.20009860396385193, 0.037249162793159485, 0.0001474859454901889, 0.002397761447355151, 0.007864008657634258, 0.17542695999145508, 0.16508804261684418, 0.20336104929447174, 0.0440647229552269], [0.00025860118330456316, 0.1640433818101883, 0.20009854435920715, 0.037249308079481125, 0.00014747865498065948, 0.002397791715338826, 0.007863652892410755, 0.1754276305437088, 0.1650877743959427, 0.20336078107357025, 0.04406503587961197], [0.00025866672513075173, 0.16404202580451965, 0.20009653270244598, 0.03725092485547066, 0.00014751279377378523, 0.0023981216363608837, 0.007864109240472317, 0.17542800307273865, 0.1650869995355606, 0.20335975289344788, 0.04406728595495224], [0.0002632149844430387, 0.16399113833904266, 0.199989914894104, 0.03734137490391731, 0.0001490975555498153, 0.0024187841918319464, 0.00788157619535923, 0.17540612816810608, 0.16507858037948608, 0.20330148935317993, 0.04417876526713371], [0.000258605316048488, 0.164043590426445, 0.20009860396385193, 0.037249162793159485, 0.0001474859454901889, 0.002397761447355151, 0.007864008657634258, 0.17542695999145508, 0.16508804261684418, 0.20336104929447174, 0.0440647229552269], [0.000258605316048488, 0.164043590426445, 0.20009860396385193, 0.037249162793159485, 0.0001474859454901889, 0.002397761447355151, 0.007864008657634258, 0.17542695999145508, 0.16508804261684418, 0.20336104929447174, 0.0440647229552269], [0.00025814271066337824, 0.16402316093444824, 0.2000911831855774, 0.037264734506607056, 0.00014669990923721343, 0.0024009079206734896, 0.007826104760169983, 0.17549973726272583, 0.16505993902683258, 0.20333148539066315, 0.04409791901707649], [0.000258605316048488, 0.164043590426445, 0.20009860396385193, 0.037249162793159485, 0.0001474859454901889, 0.002397761447355151, 0.007864008657634258, 0.17542695999145508, 0.16508804261684418, 0.20336104929447174, 0.0440647229552269], [0.0002586054033599794, 0.1640435755252838, 0.20009858906269073, 0.03724916651844978, 0.00014748598914593458, 0.0023977626115083694, 0.007864007726311684, 0.17542697489261627, 0.16508807241916656, 0.20336101949214935, 0.044064730405807495], [0.000258605316048488, 0.164043590426445, 0.20009860396385193, 0.037249162793159485, 0.0001474859454901889, 0.002397761447355151, 0.007864008657634258, 0.17542695999145508, 0.16508804261684418, 0.20336104929447174, 0.0440647229552269], [0.000258605316048488, 0.164043590426445, 0.20009860396385193, 0.037249162793159485, 0.0001474859454901889, 0.002397761447355151, 0.007864008657634258, 0.17542695999145508, 0.16508804261684418, 0.20336104929447174, 0.0440647229552269], [0.000258605316048488, 0.164043590426445, 0.20009860396385193, 0.037249162793159485, 0.0001474859454901889, 0.002397761447355151, 0.007864008657634258, 0.17542695999145508, 0.16508804261684418, 0.20336104929447174, 0.0440647229552269], [0.000258605316048488, 0.164043590426445, 0.20009860396385193, 0.037249162793159485, 0.0001474859454901889, 0.002397761447355151, 0.007864008657634258, 0.17542695999145508, 0.16508804261684418, 0.20336104929447174, 0.0440647229552269], [0.00047775328857824206, 0.15423767268657684, 0.18979991972446442, 0.04746387153863907, 8.444998093182221e-05, 0.005489942152053118, 0.0029052188619971275, 0.19094215333461761, 0.15590664744377136, 0.1911378651857376, 0.06155450642108917], [0.000258605316048488, 0.164043590426445, 0.20009860396385193, 0.037249162793159485, 0.0001474859454901889, 0.002397761447355151, 0.007864008657634258, 0.17542695999145508, 0.16508804261684418, 0.20336104929447174, 0.0440647229552269]]}
