I regularly purchase electronics, and am familiar with all kinds of gadgets, so I jumped at the chance to try out another one - the 3M MP225 Mobile Projector.First Impressions & Product Info:The first thing that struck me about this product was the high retail price.  A bit steep from my perspective, but someone who travels frequently and could use it for business presentations, I could see it being seen as an investment in the sharing of productivity and ideas.  For the casual user though, it might be a tad expensive.  Consider how you'll be using it and that should make it easier to determine if the cost is an issue for you.The projector itself is quite small (see photos), fitting into the palm of my relatively small hand. It's not very heavy, and could fit easily into a briefcase, laptop bag, purse, backpack or deep jacket pocket. It ships with two cords: AC power and Apple product connector to projector cord.There is the possibility of using the 3M Mobile Projector with your laptop or desktop PC, connecting via a VGA port, however that cord IS NOT INCLUDED with the projector. That cord:3M VC05W VGA Cable for PDAsis about twenty-five dollars.  It seems like 3M could have included it with the projector, considering the price point, and that for me at least, it's a big selling point for this device that it can work across several platforms - not just with Apple branded products!Other accessories are available for this product: a3M PS05B Portable Screenand a 3M protective case for the Mobile Projector are two which you may find useful.The product warranty is 1 year, and the LED light inside the projector has an estimated lifespan of 20,000 hours.  You don't change the bulb, which makes me wonder: \"\"When the LED dies... is the projector headed for the trash?\"\"The projector has a proprietary lithium ion rechargeable battery that needs to be charged for 3 hours prior to using the projector, and one charge is estimated to give you 2 hours of battery life. Read your Warranty and Safety guide on pg 11 for tips on Battery Maintenance and storage. They are very specific about leaving the battery at half-life to store, and not leaving it uncharged for a month, etc..., to make sure your battery will continue to perform.  NOTE: You can use the projector via the AC adapter while it's charging, but it will take longer than 3 hours to get a full charge.Size & Weight: The 3M Mobile Projector is 1.2\"\" high, 2.6\"\" wide and 5.9\"\" long.  It weighs just over half a pound.Inside the box you'll get the projector, the rechargeable battery, AC power adapter/charger and the video cable (attaches to Apple products such as iPad, iTouch, Nano, etc...) and the other end to the projector.Compatible Devices: (per Quick Start Guide)-iPad-iPhone 4/ iPhone 3GS/ iPhone 3G/ iPhone-iPod Touch 4G/3G/2G-iPod Classic-iPod Nano 4G/3G/2G-Apple iPod-iPod Touch-iPodNot mentioned in enclosed info, but mentioned on Amazon:**PCs with VGA ports are also compatible with this Mobile projector if used with 3M PDA cord - not included, but sold separately.***Camcorders, cameras and game systems can also be hooked up to the mobile projector with the addition of composite video adapters (sold separately).The 3M Mobile Projector has speakers which sound pretty good considering their size.  It also has an earphone jack which fits the standard 3.5mm sized input. There is also a tripod socket for attaching a tripod (not included) and it has a built-in stand that flips down for easy use. NOTE: The stand is plastic and isn't terribly sturdy. Use care when handling it, and try not to forget to flip it flush to the projector body before storage to keep it in tact.Depending upon the viewing distance, you'll need to focus the projector.  That is easily accomplished by a wheel underneath the Projection Lens.  You can project images and video up to 80\"\" away without loss of clarity.First Time Using the 3M MP225 Mobile Projector:I hooked up the projector to my Apple Nano to view a video I'd taken.  The first thing I noticed is that you have to hold the start button (center) for several seconds before the projector comes to life. Once it does, there is a small whirring noise - the fan on the projector - that once the volume is turned up is hardly noticeable.I used the included adapter cord to attach my 4th Gen. Nano to the projector, then once the projector was on I pushed 'play' on the Nano to view the video.  There was about a 1 second delay between seeing and hearing the video on my Nano and seeing the video being projected on the wall.  I actually heard he video before I saw it being projected.This slight delay was replicated when I tried to do the same thing with my 2nd Gen. Apple iTouch.I am inclined to purchase the 3M PDA adapter so that I can stream Netflix from my laptop to the projector, but wonder if this delay will also occur with that set-up.  It would be disappointing to watch a 2 hour movie with a video and audio sync issue.As for brightness of the projector - it's stellar!  Clear after focusing, and nice n' bright. Tried it at several distances and all looked great in a dark room.The sound from the speakers was pretty good, but I think if you were using this for a classroom setting with audio or for entertainment for a room larger than 8'x8', I'd think about adding powered speakers via the 3.5mm jack for enhanced sound.The projector does get warm to the touch while in operation.  Controls are easily accessible and easy to use.4 Out of 5 Stars: \"\"Like It\"\"Pro's:1. Highly portable.2. BRIGHT LED projection.3. Compatible with lots of devices.4. Easy to use.5. \"\"Mirroring\"\" available with some devices such as the iPad 2.Con's:1. High price tag.2. Adapters to connect to PC's and other devices like cameras, camcorders, and gaming systems, are not included and not a cheap additions.3. If LED goes out, the entire device may need to go in the trash.4. Possible audio lag issue.Overall, this is a fun gadget that could also be very useful at work or in a classroom. It's super easy to transport and set-up with lots of compatible devices. A fun gift idea for almost anyone.If I was to buy it myself, I'd want that PC (VGA) cord included for so that I could use this mobile projector for all of its intended uses, not just the current trends.The idea that the LED is not easily replaceable, and the audio lag issue, hold me back from giving this item a 5 star rating.UPDATE: 12/29/11After giving this projector to my daughter to play with using her iTouch 2nd Gen, we've discovered that Android apps like Angry Birds will not play on the projector.  YouTube videos play 'most of the time'.This could be the unit received or an issue with the 2nd Gen iTouch, then again, it could be for every unit with every Apple device - hard to tell.\"", "We can project anywhere--wall, screen, ceiling.  I purchsed 3M VC05W VGA Cable for PDAs in order to make this compatible with my Toshiba laptop.  I do not have Apple devices but this cable enables us to make use of the projector.  It is easy to use.  My only complaint is that I would like it to be a bit sharper.It is so convenient to be able to play movies, show photos, etc. anywhere we want.", "\"Greetings fellow amazonians I must say that I felt I had hit the jackpot when I received the projector I have always wanted to have a movie night here at the carnival, but I trailer is just too small. With this wonderful invention I was hoping to create some goodwill with my fellow carnies as well as with our owner. So after we shut down on Saturday night I broke this projetor out and started up the movie \"\"Ishtar\"\". We used the side of my trailer as the screen and it actually worked out pretty well. Unfortunately no one liked my movie and they started throwing bottles at my trailer and even broke two of my windows. Then a full on mutiny broke out and one of the pig iron men who work the farris wheel grabed the remote from me and threatened me with bodily harm. I then quickly ran into my trailer and locked the door leaving my fellow carnies with the projector and my ipad. Soon after my coworkers started up \"\"Spaceballs\"\" and they refused to let me come and rejoin them. So for the rest of the night I had to watch John Candy's big head coming in threw my broken windows teasing me from beyond the grave. I just wish 3M or Amazon would have put a warning on this product to warn people of the possible dangers that exist.\"", "\"3M has a collection of small projectors that are really nice and represent some technological miniaturization wizardry. Small and packable, very portable and user friendly. The new MP225 Mobile Projector includes a built-in rechargeable battery which yields about two hours of runtime without being connected to a wall outlet. As a result it is a little bigger that the ones that need to be plugged in, but at only 6\"\" long and 2-1/2\"\" wide, it's still astonishingly small for a projector. Not needing power is great for presentations at places you've never seen and don't know if there are close-by power outlets provided. The LED light is quite powerful but as with any projector, the farther you move away for the screen, the weaker the image becomes. This projector is not powerful enough for an auditorium, but it's perfect for small business meetings in conference rooms or for fun home uses.  The projector has a built-in speaker so you can hear the audio but the speaker is understandable tiny and sounds it.The projector comes with a small power brick and charging cable and an iPad/iPhone dock connector cable which plugs into the projector with a proprietary VGA-A/V plug. With this cable an iPad will play video, Keynote presentations or slide shows from the photo library. All of these look terrific but if you pause a slideshow you get a blank screen - you cannot show individual still photos, documents, PDFs or web pages. I found this very strange. After some research, I found that I had to buy Apple's iPad-to-VGA cable and a 3M VC05W \"\"PDA Cable\"\" which is actually a VGA-to-projector cable. These two cables cost a total of $60. However, with them the projector shows whatever is on the iPad screen - in fact, it mirrors the iPad so that presentations are easier for the person giving them. Also, with the above VGA-to-projector cable, the unit can now be connected to a laptop opening up a much wider array of possibilities.The projector can actually be connected to an iPhone - how's that for tiny minimalism?, but it will only display videos (YouTube, your own, ones from your iTunes library, etc.). No still images.I'm a little surprised that 3M doesn't more emphatically emphasize that this model is primarily directed at people with Apple iDevices. The packaging shows the iPad and iPhone on the side but considering that it comes with a cable that will connect to those devices only, I'd have thought that they would make more noise about this. Maybe it's a licensing thing.This is a sweet little projector that is fun and easy to use. Its portability makes it perfect for the road warrior who has to give presentations or training sessions on the go.\"", "I was happy with this until the next day it when down 14.00 in price.  Plus you can not use it on other then the I-Phone  and I-Pad.Can not find any cords for the newer I-Phone or I-PAD or other items. If you know of any so I can use it on other items. The only ones I see are over 30.00.", "\"Wow!  Opens up a new world.  A hand-size, battery-powered projector that can be used for presentations, entertainment, ties into the Internet with a laptop, and ties directly into a camera, videocam and gaming consoles.Projectors' lumens and sharpness are critical to their utility.  Images are easy to understand, even with some fuzziness, but reading fuzzy or dim TEXT turns the stomach. So, for this review, I'll use NYTimes.com website as the projected image, and provide 3 common lighting conditions in use.  Maybe you'll be able to then determine whether this projector is powerful enough for your needs.  Also, determining readability of text is requisite for projecting presentations--which is my primary purpose of this projector--for small meeting rooms to show websites and Powerpoint slides.In a room with a shaded 45 watt bulb behind the projector, and using 1024x768 resolution, and the room's windows are well shaded and have horizontal blinds, and on a bright day; screen's text reads clearly at upto 4 feet wide, and at 6 feet wide, text begins to be fuzzy.  If you'd be happy with a 3.5 feet wide screen in a dim-to-moderately lit room, you'd be happy with this projector's sharpness.In such room with a shaded window on cloud cover day with 45 watt light bulb behind the projector, screen's text is clear at upto 4 feet wide and at 6 feet wide begins to become fuzzy.In a nearly dark room with the laptop's screen providing most of the light, screen's text reads comfortably at upto 6 feet wide.  Further increasing screen resolution to 1360x768 or 1440x900, the screen's text is readable at 3 feet wide.In general, the projector is sufficiently powerful if text readable at 3 feet wide screen at 1024x768 is acceptable, and at 6 feet wide if room is dark.  Some of the other reviews misunderstood VGA resolution restricted to 640x480.  Though \"\"VGA\"\" is 640x480, about 15 years ago, the term became loosely used, such that SVGA (1024x768) also became VGA.  The projector handled upto 1440x900.For entertainment purposes, projector's portability opens up wonderful possiblities.  Imagine at night outdoors, watching a movie.  Imagine attaching portable speakers to this, and projecting Youtube karaoke songs on your friend's white walls.  Video group entertainment is now movable to any location.  I'll be using this mostly for presentations at restaurants' smaller rooms.  Easy to operate too--don't need to carry instructions around, in case you don't use it often.Here's my recommendation for a portable presentation and entertainment kit:1. This 3M projector.2. Netbook, laptop, or iPad.3. Battery powered, small, loud speakers--Tweeters.4. Gorillapod instead of standard tripod.5. Internet access personal hub or router.A whole new lifestyle trend has begun.\"", "\"This is an interesting little device that fits a very narrow niche. This is a tiny DLP projector that will fit in your pocket and throw a sizeable, screen. It has quite a few things going for it -- the two-hour battery life being a big draw -- and there's a headphone jack to offset the tinny speakers.This system has some extreme limitations, though. For starters, the screen is only 640x480, which is much less resolution than, say, an iPad or iPhone 4; if you were doing presentation work with a lot of text this wouldn't be the best choice. The screen also suffers from the DLP \"\"rainbow effect\"\" (which only seems to affect some people) and has a slight yellow tint. The screen is relatively bright at a projection distance of six feet or closer, but any further away and it's not particularly great, especially if there is any ambient light in the room.The other issue is the connector. The only included cable connects to an iPhone or iPad -- nothing for VGA or component. Worse yet, the projector only works when the iDevice is in \"\"video out\"\" mode; there IS another cable that supports mirroring what's on the iPad's screen, but it's not included. It's iDevice in Video Out mode or nothing.All in all, this is an interesting device. I'm not sure why you'd need it, as the resolution and brightness aren't particularly suited for text-heavy applications. Maybe if you're going on a family trip and want to have something for the kids to watch? It still strikes me that you'd be better off just watching an iPad screen.\"", "First of all, I am awaiting my husband's more detailed review of this projector, but that may take a while, so I thought I would start. The minute this crossed our threshold, this was undoubtedly John's new toy. He's the iPad owner so that was an obvious result anyway. Even though I am about to offer the quibbles with the thing, John loves it. He is not giving it up and it resides in his backpack or nearby him on a piece of furniture when it is not in use. I have entered rooms to find him projecting his iPad onto the ceiling, wall, etc. The mobilitiy and sufficient enough picture is enough for him.That said, we had to buy the extra $25 cable for him to do any more than watch video with the thing. For the price of the projector, that's a nuisance. And while this isn't an Apple product, it's an Apple tactic. I don't appreciate or condone it. Also, in order to set the projector at rest for a long viewing, one is usually going to want a tripod with better flexibility and stability that the little stand that is on this device. So that's another expense and addition of bulk to the device's mobility. Our larger projector is stronger and better at resolution and it is self-contained. It is bigger though, about 3 to 4 times bigger. But it doesn't need a tripod either. And it's price was within dollars of this one. But this little projector feels fun and can be hand held and takes little set up for a quick sharing of a YouTube video, game, etc. It is very convenient.Also, the cables--neither the one that came with nor the one we bought--do not fit well and shake loose very easily from John's iPad. So although he likes to hold the projector for quick displays and testing, the cables jiggle loose and he is constantly reconnecting.But while I don't have his specs of resolution, screen size, etc. The picture is decent for such a small thing. It isn't recommended for projecting screens with lots of text and a darkened room is a big help, but for basic games and movies, it's just fine.", "My fault not to read all product details. This projector requires a now hard to find and expensive cable to be able to connect to a Laptop,which was my primary intention. This product is designed for Ipad 1 and 2 and Iphone 3G and 4G, so its a dated product. Look like will have to send it back. Would had been a great deal if cable was included instead of extra battery.", "This thing works great: I took it out, plugged it in, attached to an IPad, played a video, and it projected it.  Easy as pie.  The size is also amazingly small, and it can not only project, but it also has a built-in speaker, so you can get the audio with your video. The speaker isn't all that huge, but it's adequate.  There is also a headphone out.  The bulb is an LED and unless it's defective should last long enough that you'll be on to newer technologies when it eventually dies.  (There is a one year manufacturer warranty as well, which would cover if in fact the LED were defective.)  Also, since LED's take less juice, this can also run on the built-in lithium ion battery for around two hours.  So this is an extremely cool and very useful little projector - it should be five stars easily, but there are a couple caveats.It can't project your IPad's screen.  Note this is not a limitation of the projector so much as it is of the IPad: the functionality to display video is available to apps, but is not automatic... so basically the app you wish to project must support it, otherwise forget it.  Apps that support it immediately are the standard audio/video players, the slideshow viewer, perhaps others.  We found a free Powerpoint projector app in the market which worked great with this projector, and there are actually quite a few apps out there that support projection, so this gripe shouldn't be a deal breaker.Also, while you can connect this to a standard RCA (VGA) output, the cord for it is not included.  At the price point, it probably should be.  Odds are this will be purchased by a lot of business users who would like to display from their laptop. You can do that, but you'll have to purchase an additional cord.Finally, well, it's only VGA, which is a rather limited resolution these days.Pros:Ultra CompactBuilt-in speaker and headphone outCan run on battery powerEase of useCons:Need additional cables to work with anything other than Apple productsOnly works with apps that support projection; (can't display an exact copy of the Ipad's screen)Only VGA resolution", "I waited a bit before writing a review but now I'm able to say it's not good for business presentations as it requires dark rooms. I thought it would work with some light, but it doesn't. Disappointing...", "This is not an HD projector.  As long as you keep that in mind when buying/using you shouldn't be too disappointed, especially at this price.  I bought it to project singing faces onto pumpkins for a Halloween prop.  It worked excellently for this.  It is not something you would want to watch movies on all the time though.  The on board speaker is not really loud enough for anything other than a small room but does have an audio jack to which I plugged some computer speakers in. Sound quality was good from the external speakers.  It only comes with a dongle to connect with an Apple product.  I needed an RCA dongle which is sold separately.", "I am not an Apple fanatic and their only product I own is the original iPad so that's what this review is based on.The product comes nicely and sturdily packaged, with the main unit, a charger, a cable to connect to your Apple equipment and instructions. The projector itself seems solidly built with good fit and finish (I suspect it is the batteries that give it its heft). Setup was a breeze. I charged the unit, plugged it into my iPad, and was able to project videos right away.Unfortunately, the projector is able to only mirror an iPad2, not the original iPad, so my use of this projector (unless I want to get the optional cable that enables use with a laptop) is pretty limited. That's my own fault, though, not the projector's.  One reviewer did post that there is a way to download some app that will enable mirroring on all devices but I haven't tried this. So this review is strictly about how the projector works with the original iPad.As I mentioned above, it works just fine. When video content comes on (such as YouTube), the projector automatically begins showing it. For portable use, this product works well. Someone mentioned that the built-in stand is flimsy. I didn't find it to be like that. It's just a simple little plastic stand that folds out from the bottom of the unit. As long as you have the projector on a flat, straight surface then the built-in stand works fine.Picture wise, I have no complaints. I realize something like this is not going to product a hi-def picture on your wall. For me, the brightness and clarity of the picture were fine.  If you want to project what is on your Apple device for demonstration purposes or just to have a larger picture, this device does that very well. I like how it is not bulky.  The sound from the built in speaker is no great shakes but then it is no worse than what is in the iPad and for the purpose intended for the projector, it is fine. You can always plug an external speaker or headphones into the jack if you want better sound.I found that I had to take the protective cover off of my iPad in order to insert the connecting cord. I guess that depends on the cover you are using, though, since some have larger openings than others. My cover has a small opening so I had to cut away more of it to enable the projector cord to be fully inserted.If you realize this portable, or mobile projector is a product for convenience and that you aren't going to get a fantastic 1080P picture or surround sound from it but instead it is for mobile applications (just like it says it is), then I feel you will be pleased with it.", "If you have an iDevice then this product seems great, but their only other video input option is Analog (VGA)? Seriously, is this 1998?Micro HDMI is the global standard video output for mobile devices (except for Apple). Without micro HDMI support, this projector is pretty useless.", "\"Mobile projectors are still what I would consider bleeding edge, both in the sense that they are relatively new and in the sense that they are still not quite ready for a mainstream audience.  However, the MP225 is a substantial step in the right direction.SETUPThere are few instructions with this unit, because there are almost no options.  Plug the device into either an i-device or a computer via the overpriced VGA cable, which I purchased for this review, and you are ready to go.  Component cables are also available for purchase separately.  The MP225 was detected flawlessly when I plugged it in and I was ready to go.  The only buttons are for volume, power, and battery, the latter of which displays remaining battery life on the screen.PICTUREBefore speaking about picture quality, I would like to clarify that the way we perceive lumens is not linear.  You may look at the 32 lumen rating vs. a similarly priced normal sized projector with lumens in the thousands and think it will be impossible to see.  This is not the case, because as you increase lumens, you need a greater and greater lumen increase to be able to detect an increase in brightness.  This relates to how our eyes work.  For a mobile projector, 32 lumens is very impressive by current standards, and a substantial step forward for the technology.So, what does that increase do?  If you spend an equivalent sum of money on a standard projector, you will have an image bright enough to use with the room lights on and the windows open, which is ideal for both work and home use (unless you are a vampire).  Unfortunately, the MP225 is only visible in a well-lit room when projecting a very small size image.  If you have a laptop, for example, using the laptop screen would be much better.  However, turn the lights off and this projector works shockingly well.  The specs say that the projected image can be a maximum of 80\"\" diagonal.  Taking into account the 800x600 resolution, that means around a 64\"\" (5.3') horizontal size.As a side note here, this aspect ratio is 4:3, emphasizing the intent of this for business presentations over entertainment, though it can certainly do both well and handles motion nicely.I used a tape measure to project an 80\"\" diagonal image.  In order to get this size, the projector sat around 8' from the wall.  With the lights on, the image was almost impossible to even detect.  However, with the lights off, the image was just a little washed out, which is very impressive for a mobile projector!  At this size, the text is fuzzy even at the best focus level, and it gets terrible at any larger size.  Perhaps acceptable for watching a movie, but not for Powerpoint.  The colors are good overall, but lean a bit brown.  This is particularly evident with skin tones.  It's likely that this could be corrected if there were calibration options, but I could find none.As a final note on the picture, there is an important issue which has yet to be addressed in mobile projectors in my experience.  For using them in random places like the oft mentioned hotel room for presentations, it is important to have versatility in where the projector is placed.  For standard projectors, there is keystoning (manual and/or digital) to correct for the distortion of placing the projector at a vertical or horizontal angle to the wall.  Some even have lens shift features.  With the MP225, these features are completely absent, so for a given size image, the projector needs to be in a very exact place and angle.  The little kickstand is nearly worthless for this, so I recommend buying a tripod.  Any standard camera tripod will work.  This required accessory substantially hurts the portable nature of the product.BATTERYThe battery is awesome.  It makes up a large portion of the projector's size and weight, but it is worth it.  The 2-hour spec was almost exactly true in my test. This means that you aren't tethered to a wall socket.BUILDThe projector is all plastic, but does not feel cheap.  3M sells a carrying case, which may be a good idea if you plan to travel with it a lot, but it should stand up to normal handling.CONCLUSIONSThe MP225 is bright enough to project a high quality image that will work well for both presentations and entertainment in a dark room.  We are still far from the point of convergence, where all projectors shrink to a mobile size, but the long battery life and simple setup of this 3M unit show that they are still the company to beat.  Unlike some previous products in this category, the niche audience this is aimed for will find this projector a valuable tool rather than solely a fun gadget.  Just make sure that this product is what you are looking for before you buy it.  It will not replace a normal projector.  Then again, neither will a normal projector replace this.\"", "Small, portable, lightweight all words that describe this device.  Add to those simple, easy, efficient as well.  The MP225 Mobile Projector is perfect for anyone who might need to be ready to give a presentation anywhere.  But the uses are well beyond just business.  Watching movies on your bedroom ceiling as you fall asleep is now possible.  Playing Angry Birds with your family, or displaying family photos for everyone to enjoy at one.  I haven't been using the Mobile Projector for a long time, but I've found countless uses.  I've had multiple requests to borrow it already from friends and family.  Perfect for camping, or living rooms, or conference rooms.  The charge time is super short (around 3 hrs) and the battery life is about 2 hrs.  Also, it's easy to focus, can be just about any size, and weighs next to nothing.  I haven't compared it to other mobile projectors, but I don't know how I lived without it.  I ordered the VGA adapter so now I can connect my laptop as well.  Highly, highly recommended.", "As a Mac user I am impressed with this mobile projector.  This unit is ideal for sharing my photos and videos.  In addition to Apple computers and Apple laptops it operates with your iPhone, iPad or iPod.  The unit has approximately 2 hours of battery life, which is enough to watch your favorite movies.  The 3M projector also operates continuously on AC power.  You need to purchase a 3M computer  ( VGA ) cable to allow images to be projected from a personal computer.", "My expectations for this were low, particularly because of the advertised brightness of 32 lumens, which compared to the thousands of lumens of a real projector didn't seem like it would be adequate.  I also didn't think that a useful projector could possibly be sold for the current low price of $299 since most good projectors cost 2 or 3 times that amount.  To some extent my fears were correct, in that it is nowhere near as bright as the projectors you find in a meeting room or classroom.  That said though, the brightness is certainly adequate for a dimly lit hotel room or living room.  It does really well in dark room.Price.  $299 is an awesome price for this technology.  The last projector that I bought cost over $2000 with replacement bulbs costing more than this whole projector does.  3M probably knew that they wouldn't be able to achieve good sales volume with the price any higher than this in the consumer market, but either way the customer wins with this price.LED bulb.  The low power consumption, highly durable, and long-life LED bulb is probably the reason this projector only puts out 32 lumens.  Considering how much projector bulbs usually cost and how fragile they usually are, I think using LED is a great choice.  The estimated lifespan of 20,000 hours is probably conservative for a completely solid state technology like LED, but even if it is accurate, 20,000 hours is a whole lot of movies and games.  20,000/24=833 days of continuous use.  20,000/8/365=7 years of use if you were to use it for 8 hours a day.  My point is basically that the light bulb in this projector is going to outlive anything you have attached to it, unless you are using it constantly.Battery.  The battery works fine now, after just a few days of use, but I have a feeling that the 2 hours of runtime won't last beyond the first year or so.  I don't have any evidence to support this claim, so I won't say much more about it.  I am just leery of the battery in a use case like this lasting for very long unless you really take good care of it.Connectivity.  I only tested it with Apple products, because that is the only cables it comes with.  For the iPad 2, iPod Touch, and the iPhone 4S, it works great.  Very simple to set-up and use.  Some reviewers are complaining that it didn't come with the cables for other devices, but at this price point, and their target audience being the Apple crowd, I am OK with it only coming with the Apple cable.  The supplied cable is long enough and is well made.Audio.  The speaker in this projector isn't much better than what is in the iPad 2, but it is good enough for the number of people you'd be using this with.Ease of use.  As I said in the connectively section, it is easy to set-up and use with Apple devices.  The projector itself is also very easy to turn on and focus.Overall, I recommend this projector for use with Apple products in dark rooms.  It is perfect for a business traveler who wants to be able to view your content on a bigger `display'."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[7.872295827837661e-05, 0.004004627466201782, 0.028063561767339706, 0.000520558503922075, 0.0365021750330925, 0.03864268958568573, 0.01884504035115242, 0.0002949426125269383, 0.13301658630371094, 0.0038272496312856674, 0.15587934851646423, 0.12253496050834656, 0.01385307777673006, 0.12796613574028015, 0.0024987664073705673, 0.11540529876947403, 0.04087822139263153, 0.1571880280971527]]}
