So far, Bamboo is the thinnest tip I can find for writing on my iPad 3 - although it takes some getting use to because when using a real pen, I prefer ultra fine writing.  But overall, I like the Bamboo products the best for writing on my tablet!  This and other Bamboo stylus are very well made. This particular one came with 2 nibs (others only come with one tip)... it also comes with colored rings - didn't really find these useful for me, but someone else might like being able to customize the color.  I give it a 4 out of 5 mainly because I haven't found another stylus I like better, but am still looking.", "\"Our family has been using the Bamboo brand standard non-collapsable stylus for the iPad for almost a year. It is our favorite brand (after trying two other brands and types) because it feels good in the hand, with a good \"\"weight\"\" to it. It feels like a real pen, and it has a good surface to work with the iPad for notetaking.This expandable stylus compacts down to become a bit smaller. I am not sure how necessary this is to be honest. If something a bit smaller is what you want, then here you go.You can attach this stylus to the iPhone with the clip that comes with this product. I do not feel a need to use a stylus with my iPhone so I didn't need that portion of this product.I rate this product 5 stars = I Love It even though in the end my husband and I felt the standard, non-expandable stylus was all we really need.\"", "\"This is by far the best stylus I own. Here's what I think:Pros:Customizable (the box includes two point sizes, as well as these little colored rings so you can \"\"personalize\"\" your stylus).Extendable (it shortens so it can actually fit in your pocket)Metal bodyActually feels like holding a penPocket clipCons:Skips a bit. (I have an Otterbox case, so the plastic overlay might be the issue here.)The metal cap that covers the pointing tip doesn't fit securely on the other end of the stylus (like a pen cap)-- so you either use the headphone jack attachment, or just risk losing the cap altogether.The headphone jack attachment (which is supposed attach the stylus to the device via its cap)There's also no pen -- it's just a stylus. Initially, I thought that what I wanted was just a stylus, but after using several pen/stylus combo models, I found that I actually miss having the pen.In all, the stylus is pretty great for drawing on a tablet, and that's primarily how I use it. Any other activity, however, is often more convenient to complete without this extra little gadget. The cap not fitting on the the opposite end of the stylus is probably my biggest complaint design-wise... so, while the pocket clip is great, I'd actually sacrifice that if I didn't have to worry about losing the cap all the time. I don't use the headphone jack attachment: not only does my Otterbox case not permit that conveniently, but what if I am actually using the headphones? Plus, who wants a haphazardly dangling stylus? ;-)\"", "I already owned theBamboo Solo Stylus for iPad - Black (CS100K)and this new collapsable version shares many of the pros and cons. This is a good stylus for artwork, but I found the rubbery tip to be a little too soft for writing text. I'm also a little afraid of gouging the screen with the metal edge under the rubber tip. That said, this is a nice compact stylus for the price.I found the various color rings to be superfluous, unless of course you're a multi-stylus family, say, and don't want to mix them up. Likewise, I don't think I ever want the stylus to be swinging from my headphone port where it could damage the port or the iPad screen.Other than those few quibbles, I do like this compact stylus.", "\"I already have an older Bamboo stylus from Wacom that's a single solid piece (like a pen) which gets a lot of use around the house with our iPad but thought it'd be interesting to check this one out as well.As noted, the main feature here is the fact that you can expand the stylus as needed. It extends the stylus from 3.5\"\" to 4.5\"\". Doesn't seem like much but it goes from feeling like a crayon to feeling like a small pen.The package includes two alternate colored bands for either end of the grip, an extra nib, and a cap with a cord.The bands are just for looks, obviously. You get two blue and two red (the stylus comes with two silver ones). You've got to unscrew the tip and pull off the grip to install the higher one but unless you plan on changing these often, it shouldn't be too much of a hassle.The extra nib gives you one hard and one soft nib. Which one you use depends on how much pressure you like to press with. I found the hard nib spotty at best. The soft one worked better. The reason is the nib really just separates the screen from the sensor (the metal piece the nib is covering). The hard nib is thicker so it doesn't work well unless you press hard. Still, I like that they give you the option to choose.The cap is kind of cool actually. What they did was thread a string through the top to a rubber piece that's designed to be inserted into the headphone jack of your iPad or iPhone. You can't use the pen to hold up the device (the rubber piece isn't that secure) but it's a great way to carry the stylus around and not lose it if you don't mind the \"\"dongle\"\". You can remove it but you'll end up with a hole in the tip of the cap. Not a big deal but it is what it is. There's a pen clip on the end so you can still pocket the stylus without the cap if you want. Lots of options!All in all, it's a pretty solid product. It's a bit small for my large hands but the grip makes it a lot easier to use compared to the older one I have that doesn't have the grip.Wacom markets a free iPad app (not for iPhone given the size of the screen) that you can use to take notes (sort of) and draw. There are better ones (Penultimate and SketchBook Pro) but they cost more than free. :)With the various options and the solid responsiveness (from the soft nib), this is a great product if you're looking for a stylus for your iPad or iPhone.\"", "The product is excellent, just too small. I use it in multiple applications. I only gave it 4 stars because of the size.", "Leave it to Wacom to try and find a better way to build an iPad stylus, Despite the opposition voiced by the late Steve Jobs to the marriage of pads and pens, there actually are good reasons to wed them. Pens are easier to use in most drawing applications, save wear and tear on your fingers and feel natural in your hand.I am someone who not only believes in using pens with my iPad, I collect them from a number of manufacturers. Not that I actually am a stylus collector.  I've just been search for the perfect stylus since I bought my iPad--and it's the original iPad (iPad 1.) I've also worn a number of my pens out.Some of my pens are combo stylus types (capacitive tip on one side, ink pen on the other.) They haven't impressed me. Some are short, some are longer. Some are bland, some are sexy. None really satisfy me so I often resort to my trusty old finger. (I think that I just made Steve very happy.)Wacom has just about done it right with the Bamboo Pocket Expandable Stylus for iPad. The stylus is easy to use, accurate in selecting text, customizable with red, blue or silver accent rings (your choice and changeable at any time,) and is extendable. It also attaches to the iPad by claiming the earplug jack keeping the pen and the iPad together. That's a nice touch as long as you don't regularly listen to your iPad with headphones or ear plugs.I found it much easier to select text (even tiny web page text) with the Bamboo Pocket Expandable Stylus than with my fat fingers.  However, just about every stylus that I've used is too short. None are anywhere near the length of a ballpoint pen. And why that is the case is a total mystery to me. Even the extendable Bamboo Pocket Expandable Stylus is too short for my hand when extended fully.  That makes the stylus less comfortable in the hand.Still, I enjoying using it--and, as a bonus, my typing fingers are most appreciative.", "My wife has been using this stylus for drawing on her iPad for over a year and absolutely loves it. The only issue is that the nibs crack pretty fast. They are cheap to replace, and can be ordered from both Wacom's website and Amazon, but still. It's not a big issue, just an inconvenience.", "Coming from Wacom,, I expected this to be a superior stylus.It isn't.They made it extendable, which is a nice idea - but there is no locking mechanism, so you can accidentally collapse the extended stylus.The tip is far broader than I expected. Used with Autodesk Sketchbook, the tip skips, leaving gaps in the lines I draw.I got it on sale so it wasn't much more expensive than the run of the mill styli. If I hadn't gotten a good sale price, I'd consider it vastly overpriced and would return it.Jerry", "Very nice stylus, work very well with my acer iconia w700, I was searching for one stylus that work perfectly with my Iconia W700 and i have a winner , i have two winner i buy the pink one too", "I've played around with a couple of iPAD stylus devices over the past 4 or 5 years.  Up until now, I've always given up on using them for any sort of serious work function as they are just too wonky.This Bamboo Pocket Expandable Stylus for iPAD has so far been a different story.  From the very first use, I found it to work well with my iPAD.  I have been able to take notes while on conference calls and write messages with ease.  I have had very little problems with the device and it has certainly made my productivity in terms of using my iPAD better and more efficient.  This in conjunction with a good keyboard makes the iPAD much more than a toy or music player.  It is now a valid and helpful productivity device.", "I thought a stylus made by Wacom would be the bomb. I mean they make the industry standard graphic tablets with pressure sensitive styli.I was wrong. This thing is the pits, and going back. And I got a pretty good price in a Lightning Deal.This won't be a long review; partially because I didn't use it very long. Just long enough to discover that swiping and scrolling we next to impossible with this thing. IF it can't do those, what does it matter how good it does everything else.I'd think I got a defective one, but how complex are these things? I've owned several of their graphic tablets and they work great. I'd give them five stars. But their stylus I'm hard pressed to give one. But if you don't give any, you can't publish a review. So pretend that the one star above is just a figment of your imagination.A most disappointing purchase.UPDATE - if you want to save your money, you can get a better stylus costing 40 cents (no, not a misprint, they're about a buck for a three-pack) with free shipping, and not be disappointed. If you find I'm wrong, for the price, you can just throw them away if you don't find me right.3 Pack of Black Blue Pink Stylus Universal Touch Screen Pen for Ipad 2 Ipod Iphone 4,4S,3g ,3gs,Motorola Xoom, Samsung Galaxy Tab 8.9 10.1, Blackberry Playbook HTC Flyer Evo", "I needed this for mostly fun purposes on my new iPad Mini but the tip is kind of flimsy. It's a great product, I just thought the tip would be more stiff. I like that it expands but it doesn't lock so depending on how you use the stylus it will collapse back into itself if you push hard enough.", "I've been using this stylus for a while on my iPad, Galaxy Tab and Kindle Fire. Overall it works well but writing or drawing with it did take some getting used to. I found the stylus to be useful in drawing apps but not that much in note taking. While it does work typing a message was quicker and usable in other apps. My son loves drawing on the iPad with it but for the price the other stylus products would be better.Now the things I did like about the Wacom stylus were build quality, size, durability of the ribber tip and the free Bamboo app that Wacom has available in the App store. With other alternatives on the market you may want to read reviews on each and decide what will work best based on your needs.", "\"I'm a gadget lover from back when all devices used a stylus for input, so I like to use them with my iPad.  I've tried various styli, but the best one I had used until now was the regular Wacom Bamboo.  I say \"\"until now\"\" because I think the Bamboo Pocket Expandable stylus is now my favorite input device.The first thing I'll get out of the way is, yes, it's on the expensive side and without out a doubt you're paying some \"\"Wacom tax.\"\"  But as a person who works with graphics and has extensive use of their tablets, I've come to associate that name with quality, and this stylus lives up to that reputation.It's very well-made, with a brushed aluminum feel and a collapsible body that helps with portability.  When extended it's about 4.5 inches long and that length, coupled with a front-balanced weight make for a fantastic writing tool.  I also appreciate the little touches, such as the ability to customize the accents above and below the rubber grip with either silver, blue or red (all included).  A cap is also included and has a string with a plug attachment on the end, so you can leave it plugged into the headphone jack of your device to prevent your misplacing it.But what good are looks if the stylus doesn't perform?  Well, I can certainly say that the Bamboo Pocket stylus lives up to the Wacom name in that department as well.  It's a rubber-tipped stylus, but the included tip is Wacom's \"\"firm\"\" nib, which, for those of you who own the regular Bamboo, means it's not as mushy and doesn't feel like it's dragging across the screen as much.  It does require a slightly harder press to register if you have a screen protector on (I use a3M Natural View Fingerprint Fading Screen Protector for the New iPad (3rd generation) and the iPad 2 (NVFFiPad3)), which took a little getting used to, but now I prefer the smoothness of the firm nib.  Also, compared to some of the other styluses I've used, the Wacom Bamboo line uses a narrower nib, allowing for finer control, which is great for sketching or writing.  Another plus is that the nibs are replaceable and relatively inexpensive, which means you won't have to throw away the entire thing if your nib breaks (which has happened on a few other styli I've used).In conclusion, the excellent sensitivity, firmer nib, and stylish and solid body all make the Bamboo Pocket stylus my new favorite stylus.  Yes, it's certainly more expensive than other input devices out there, but when you factor in the build quality and the fact that you can replace nibs inexpensively, it certainly makes this Wacom stylus worthwhile for anyone.\"", "I use it mainly just as a portable stylus for my iPad to make quick sketches and notes on the go or for the kids to play around with, but the quality and responsiveness isn't the greatest. For the price though it was good. Got it for pretty cheap on black friday (i think it was $9)", "\"(review by NJCelt my husband)I have owned one type of Wacom digitizer tablet or another since my Toshiba XP Tablet Edition, tablet in 2000. That said I have used many types of stylus. (Is the plural Styli? jk) there have been many attempts at making what l consider to be the best stylus.These newer types that work on both digitizer and capacitive screens, are obviously in the forefront of the technology. However not all of these are the BAMBOO Expandable pocket stylus.This is fluidity in motion. It can write a fine line or a broad stroke.It can even feather nicely(yes the reviewer with the Otterbox was right in[well mostly right, he should have assigned full blame] assigning partial blame to the plastic screen protector for interference. It even states this in the mini manual that comes with it.If you have gorilla glass or gorilla glass ll forget about a screen protector(unless you are the type to toss diamonds in your pocket with your smartphone, or tablet.) I have not been able to purposefully scratch my devices starting with my Dell Streak 5(the first Phablet) and ending with the Samsung Note ll, from which l write this review.Most stylus are not balanced making them inferior right off. Let's face it, balance is key to making an effective stylus. Next is weight. Third is fluidity.This particular BAMBOO model has all three in spades.Even with the extendible upper part closed down, the balance of this is incredible. I'm in IT so l know technology. Could they have built a pen into this, yes, amd I'm sure there would be a market for that model, just not from me. I used to create 3D models back in the late 90's. I enjoyed the process, and even started skinning(creating the outside image.) l didn't discover l had artistic talent in painting until l started playing with an app that came with my Toshiba. That started me off creating digital watercolors and oils, as well as charcoal sketches. There are many ways you can hold this stylus, when using those apps to get the effect, edge, blur, depth, etc.To correct another mistake. There is a replacement tip for the future inside the box. It is the exact same size as the tip which comes on your BAMBOO(what you're still reading, and haven't checked out yet) stylus. However they sell sets of three nibs(their name, not mine) when you finally get to the time when you've worn the two that come with, out. It takes some time. Also there are three sets of color rings(silver comes installed, blue and red are inside the package) This homes in handy if you want to change the look of your BAMBOO, or say you've bought a few and don't want them getting confused (after all everyone utilizes their own pressure, and holds their BAMBOO differently. This causes each to personalize to that operators particular uniqueness.)Pros:BalancedWeightFluidityDurableAdjustable3 sets of colored rings to personalize your bambooCons:Lanyard on Cap (this might cause absent minded folk to leave their Bamboo stylus behind) Personally jthis isn't a con for me because I always put the cap back on everything!I actually cut a \"\" slit in the suede on the left edge of the flip cover protective case with magnetic fold over lock(not a lock but the magnet holds it shut.) the top end with the clip fits in the slot so the stylus isn't loosely banging around.\"", "Fits in my hand kind of small, but I have bigger than average hands. The materials look very nice and durable though.", "The Bamboo brand expandable stylus with a narrow replaceable nib is great for my iPod Touch 5g. The Bamboo Stylus is well made, has a nice rubber finger grip  that is a big help when writing and it is the most expensive one I have yet found on today's market.I like the size and heft of it, but it may be a bit bulky for some people.  It is one of the few styli available with a replaceable nib and those nibs are available in firm or soft densities.  This is a very nice stylus and even with the high price tag I can recommend it.", "I've bought a few styli for use in taking hand-written notes on my iPad, but none of them have been entirely satisfactory. Though they worked, the rubber tip seemed to drag on the screen and there was not a natural feel. These were, admittedly, cheap styli, but I figured, how much difference could there be between a cheap one and an expensive one? Then I saw this Bamboo product offered on Vine and decided to try it. What a difference! The feel of this stylus is much smoother and more natural, so that hand-writing flows almost like pen on paper. It works well with Penultimate, my go-to note-taking app, and I also sprung for the full version of the Bamboo app, which seems to work even better. Highly recommended if you like using a stylus with your tablet.", "Apparently there are people who lie awake nights thinking of ways to enhance the simple stylus in order to justify charging ever larger sums for it.I received this stylus as part of the Amazon Vine program in exchange for my agreement to review it.  It is perfectly adequate as a stylus.  It is expandable, scopes down to around 4 inches which makes it handy to carry along as a spare.  The other features, to me, are just window dressing.  There are a couple of sets of different colored rings you can attach to personalize your stylus.  I unscrewed the silver ring and replaced it with a burgundy colored ring.  I cannot figure out how to attach the other burgundy colored ring.  The instructions are no help.This stylus comes with a spare tip, which is handy, as well as a cover/headphone attachment.  Since the stylus does not fit well in the pen loop of my iPad cover, the cover attached to a cord which fits into the headphone port is a desirable alternative.I do like the feel of the stylus itself on my iPad with a matte screen protector - it is nice and firm with just a little bit of bounce and moves smoothly as opposed to other styli that are more rubbery and a little bit stickier.  Personally I don't think it's worth the price but I suspect some of the cool factor is lost on me.Update 10/25/12 - I have been giving this stylus lots of use, and I have to say I really like the surface.  It glides beautifully along my iPad.  Still overpriced but its appeal is growing on me.Update 11/1/12 - Well, the stylus came apart.  The ring unscrewed itself and now it has something loose inside of it, it rattles in a very distracting manner. I retired it and went back to the stylus I was using before.  When it comes right down to it, the only thing I like about this product was the smooth texture of the tip, and I like that a lot, but it is not worth the aggravation.  At first I liked the expandable quality, but that's really not a positive feature when you are using it constantly and the length of the stylus randomly changes.  I am not recommending this product.", "This is probably the best stylus I have ever used. Hits where you want it to, easy to write with. comes with an extra black tip. Honestly don't use the expandable feature much. Not sure what the point of the colored bands is, but they don't detract. The little headphone plugin cap needs to be tethered to this in a real way. It is absolutely going to get lost.All in all, it serves its purpose well.", "In my quest for the best stylus to draw and paint with on the iPad I finally purchased the Wacom Bamboo Stylus.  I have been a Wacom user for many years, I started with a Graphire Tablet and eventually graduated to the Intuos line.  My gripe with the iPad has always been that one could not get anywhere near the drawing experience on it as I could with my Intuos.  Does the Bamboo Stylus make the iPad like a Cintiq display tablet, hardly, but it's a step up from any rubber tipped stylus I have tried to date.  It is well bablanced and there are replacement nibs available.  Reviewers who complain that the nips wear out should note that no capacitive stylus lasts forever--and the more you use it the less it glides on the tablet glass surface--so Wacom has done the customer a favor by making replacement nibs available as otherwise in a few months one would end up having to replace the entire, expensive stylus completely.  I reccomend it highly, although I can't comment on how it compares with one of the plastic hard disk drawing implements.  For sketching and writing you really can't beat this, but if you enjoy painting a more natural media like painting experince is available with something like the Nomad brush--however I've found that that type of stylus not so good for sketching as one can't put enough pressure on the brush bristles to create crisp lines--it is a good approximation of a round brush, but not a flat one--the Bamboo would give you more of a flat brush painting experience.  I can't reccomend the Bamboo Paper application though as it is extremely limited both in terms of tools and color palate and i hope that Wacom rethinks that--but you can try it for free from the App Store and see for yourself weather it's your cup of tea--if you're just taking notes you might like it. IF you want to write as well as draw a better virtual sketchbook is the Paper App by 34--with the Bamboo Stylus that app really rocks.  Again you can try a starter edition if you desire to try before you buy.", "I used many stylus for my iPad as I don't like fingerprints on the screen.  This Bambook pocket expandable stylus for iPad feels good and works pretty smoothly on the screen, even with a screen protector.  I tried using it to take notes and it does seem to be better controlled than the other ones.  The tip comes with soft and hard ones and I used the hard ones and feels pretty responsible.  The only thing I don't like is the cap can easily be lost if you take it off and you no longer can attach the stylus to the iPad if you lose the cap as the little string that you can stick into the earphone plug is attached to the cap.  Overall, it is a nice stylus but I wished it didn't have a cap that can come off.", "I'm a big fan of Wacom Bamboo products, including my trusty WACOM Pen Tablet. I already had a stylus, but this one is a nice addition to my iPad/iPhone accessories (yes, it's not just for iPad). The great feature here is the cap. It's a small thing, but being collapsible and having a cap means I can just slip it into my pocket without worrying about ruining the rubber tip. That means I always have it handy at cafes and other public places. I don't care for the part that plugs into the ear-bud output--having the pen hanging off my iPad and flopping around is not a particularly good idea. This stylus does not work better than my old one, but it does seem to be more accurate when writing notes. The great thing about a stylus, of course, is that it keeps my fingers off the screen. The only drawback here is the rather high price of $35."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.000393431429984048, 0.12255996465682983, 0.0010157767683267593, 0.0003376260574441403, 0.011845382861793041, 0.0815587267279625, 0.10465606302022934, 0.0644192025065422, 0.03232898563146591, 0.003399484558030963, 0.06908011436462402, 0.004442078061401844, 0.047903817147016525, 8.36922408780083e-05, 0.009983820840716362, 0.0011995160020887852, 3.0712701118318364e-05, 0.08433473110198975, 0.110240139067173, 0.08562004566192627, 0.00020278844749554992, 0.07473864406347275, 0.08627832680940628, 0.0007210220792330801, 0.002625909633934498]]}
