"], "reviews": ["\"The box looks like one of those old-fashioned wooden fruit crates.  Can't really tell by the photo here, but it does.  It has all kinds of witty sayings written on it... \"\"Kale yes!\"\" and \"\"Hugs and quiches\"\" and so on.  The food products are nested in shredded brown paper.  Overall it's a very natural and quaint presentation.  The shredded paper left some dust on the spice bottle and at first I thought it was dirt since it was brown, but then I realized....I have often cooked with quinoa and lentils and mung beans and Bragg's Liquid Aminos, but the sprouted lentils and beans were a new experience for me, as was the spice shaker.  Oh my goodness those spices were so tasty.  My nine-year-old daughter selected one of the four recipes that were included.  I was like, \"\"Meh, I've cooked all of this before... whatever...\"\"  But the recipe we made-- Quinoa and Sweet Potato Cakes--was entirely new to me.  It was so good.  Like Thanksgiving all in one patty.  So there's these four recipes included, and they all use most of the ingredients in the box--just add fresh veggies.  The sprouted beans cook up in just five minutes, which is pretty amazing to me as a veteran bean cooker.  In my opinion, sprouted beans taste stronger than standard beans, and not very good on their own, but with the two Bragg's ingredients in the box, and the excellent recipes (well, I only tried one), the beans are perfectly balanced.  We had a delicious dinner.  My 6-year-old finished her plate of food and was going for more before we had even served up everyone's food and said the prayer.  Little rascal.  But anyway, if kids think it's good, you know it's good.All of the recipes are vegan and gluten-free, as are all the ingredients in the box.  All organic, too.  Also included in the box was a pamphlet about how to start on a healthy diet.Another reviewer commented that the quinoa instructions should say that quinoa must be washed first.  I noticed that too, and it's true that quinoa should always be washed before cooking, so I looked for any such instruction, but then I noticed that the package says the quinoa is thoroughly washed.  Why isn't quinoa always sold that way?  I cooked it without washing it.  It was good, clean.I think this is a great combo pack, very simple and straightforward ingredients and recipes.  As soon as I opened it I was thinking of the many people I would like to see on a healthier diet, and I'm guessing that's what this box is intended for... those of us who do eat a whole foods diet and hope to win our friends over with a nifty gift.  Yeah.  Support the positive propaganda!\"", "This gift is a wonderful accompaniment to any kitchen, especially for those who are health conscious and want to serve natural and organic foods at home.  The Braggs Liquid aminos is an excellent alternative to soy sauce (without all the extra salt) and have used it twice for the base of delicious marinades on seafood, along with garlic and ginger.  The Braggs organic seasoning is very tasty on mixed vegetables to kick them up a notch, or sprinkled on potatoes.  Just watch out with how much you are using if you have high blood pressure or are watching your sodium intake.  The quinoa was very fresh and nutty tasting, and I liked the fact that it is pre-washed, saving an arduous step in cooking quinoa.  Makes it a very easy and healthy side dish to include with any main dish.", "\"First, the quality of the individual products in the box is great.  Packaging is also nicely done (not the mailing packaging, but the gift box and its quality.  We are very pleased with all items in the box.With that said, My only real complaint is price.  The 4.4 pounds includes everything - even the packaging.  The quantities are not being shown in the product description as I write this review.  This is not a lot more than a product sampling package, yet the Amazon price at this moment is an even $40.  That works out to very expensive \"\"per ounce pricing\"\" if you purchased each of the items individually.But there is one additional positive.  It's become common to expect \"\"gift baskets\"\" and other types of gift selections to be priced very high.  If you're willing to pay the money for a very nice gift, that's exactly what you'll be giving - a very nice gift.Had it not been for the pricing, this would have been a very solid 4-star rating (we give VERY few 5-star ratings - they truly have to be the best of the best to get 5 stars from us.\"", "This gift box is large but only contains 5 items besides some recipe cards.  These 5 items are definitely healthy and vegan-based.In this gift box I received:12 oz truRoots Organic Quinoa10 oz truRoots Organic Sprouted Mung Beans (which I can't wait to try)10 oz truRoots Organic Sprouted Green Lentils6 oz Bragg Liquid Aminos which is a natural soy sauce alternative (this I'm not too thrilled to try)1.5 oz Bragg Organic 24 Herbs & Spices Sprinkle SeasoningThere's also a pamphlet on getting started (toward healthy eating), one card describing the products, and 4 recipe cards using the ingredients in the package.  I am disappointed that nowhere in any of the instructions (recipe card, package directions, etc.) did it say that quinoa should be washed before cooking.  I have a lot of quinoa at home and you always have to wash it first to remove the saponins (soap like film).I would have rated this package 5 stars because the idea, recipe cards and three grains/beans enclosed are great.  However, there are two main reasons that caused me to rate this 4 stars. First, the products supplied can be purchased separately for about $23 retail--of course without the recipe cards which is a nice touch.  Second, the box it comes in is too big.  I think Whole Foods wants to give the impression that you are getting a lot for the price but it's really a waste of cardboard.  If this package were priced between $30 and $32 and came in a smaller box more suitable to the items enclosed, I would have rated this five stars. As of this review, the price on Amazon is $40.This is certainly an interesting twist on a gift although the recipient might not think you spent so much.", "I got this as a Christmas gift for a friend who is vegan, and she loved it all!  I gave it to her a couple of weeks ago, and she said everything was delicious, and that it was nice to get a gift set like that.  Great gift for any vegetarians/vegans on your list, and it comes in a nice box, and it's packaged beautifully!Would definitely get this again, great deal!", "A friend's daughter has just gone to college.  Now that she's there she's decided to go vegan and can't find anything but potato chips to eat.  I suggested my friend send her this, along with arice cookerorhot pot.  As long as those appliances are allowed in her dorm, she can have good healthy meals and plenty of protein, right there in her dorm room.I have quinoa or lentils several times a week, partly because I like them and partly because they fit my budget.  I'm new to sprouted mung beans and the liquid aminos and seasoning.  I've had a week of fast and easy lunches with this kit, and this is what I've noticed so far:Quinoa: Oh, man, I am getting spoiled.  I love quinoa but hate to have to rinse it.  This quinoa is pre-rinsed, so it goes straight into the pot.  I've always cooked it for 10 minutes, though the package says 15.  10 seems to be just fine for this quinoa, too.  It also seems to be fluffier than my usual quinoa.  The flavor is the same, which is to say, not much, so it works well to replace rice.  I add it to soups or chill it to add to salads.  I've also had it for breakfast instead of oatmeal.  1/4 cup dry (about 1/2 cup cooked) has 5g of protein, so I'm not looking for a mid-morning snack after having this for breakfast.Lentils: I sauteed some onion, added broth and a half cup of lentils, then added a good pinch of seasoning.  20 minutes after I started chopping the onion I had a really great lentil soup.  Since I don't cook with salt I sprayed a little of the liquid aminos over the top.  Best lentils I've had in a long time.Mung beans: The first time I made lentil soup with this kit I figured I'd throw in some mung beans. That was a mistake--the mung beans have a stronger flavor and they completely overwhelmed the lentils.  I ended up with a soup with a nutty flavor, and it wasn't as thick as I expected.  It wasn't lentil soup, but it was very good.  Since then I mostly cook and chill these to add to salads.  The instructions say 3 cups water to 1 cup mung beans, but 3 cups left me with a lot of water to pour off.  A 2 to 1 ratio seems to be about right.Liquid Aminos: I just tasted a bit of soy sauce then a bit of Liquid Aminos.  (I don't recommend that, by the way.)  They taste about the same.  My soy sauce has a preservative, and there's no preservative in the Liquid Aminos.  Otherwise I'm not sure what the difference is.  The spray bottle is handy.  I'd use them interchangeably.Bragg Organic Sprinkle: A nice seasoning mix.  I've been using it in soups and on chicken.  I'll have to try it on popcorn.The kit comes with four recipes, but to be honest I haven't tried any of them.  I keep a fairly well-stocked kitchen, but I was missing ingredients from every recipe.  I'm looking forward to trying them (especially the Quinoa and Sweet Potato Cakes,) but it would be nice to see a few recipes with ingredients most people will have on hand.I really like this kit, and while I do find it expensive, I'd happily give it as a gift to someone who wants to take their cooking in this direction.", "\"This Whole Foods gift set contains 5 items and each are high quality healthy foods. Quinoa, mung beans, lentils, Braggs spray and seasoning blend.  They are just my type of food and I enjoyed trying one food that was new to me.  But the box looked so empty that I was digging around in the filler for more even though I knew there were only the 5 items included.  Considering that you are paying a huge premium for the convenience of a gift box and the desire to impress the recipient of your gift, you would expect a little more oomph in the box.  Maybe include an organic vegan chocolate bar?  Or a beverage?So it's a little lackluster, which is why I took away one star.  I almost took 2 stars off (yes, it's that bland) but then I realized that this set has the added bonus of being vegan friendly and gluten free.  Most gift baskets would not be suitable for someone in that position.  So kudos for that!  But I still think it needs just one indulgent item or non-food item added to the box to make it gift worthy.  Something that doesn't just say \"\"Here, I bought you some groceries\"\".Whole Foods offers other configurations of gift boxes and they are really nice.  The larger box packs a nice variety of snacks and has eye appeal.  The smaller coffee set is also very nice - you can't go wrong with coffee!\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.1182326078414917, 0.1487191766500473, 0.17917010188102722, 0.14555899798870087, 0.136903777718544, 0.11137267202138901, 0.1600426584482193]]}
