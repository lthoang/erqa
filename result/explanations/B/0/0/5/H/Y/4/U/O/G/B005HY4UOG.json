How well could they design a docking station for Android phones \"\"in general\"\" when the models vary so much? Answer: they have done a GREAT job on setup and a WEAK job on day-to-day usage.First the good news.I really put setup to the test: I did not open the manual until afterward. There was a sticker telling me to install the \"\"Philips Fidelio\"\" Android app, so I did, and ran it. It said it was searching for Philips devices, and after a minute displayed Philips AS111 which I touched to select. 30 seconds more and it said it was connected via Bluetooth.(The sound goes through wireless Bluetooth. The only plug for your phone is a Micro USB plug, that is, just a standard charger plug. This plug plus a handy little stand holds your phone in place as pictured on this page.)I proceeded to run my favorite music player (Pandora) and the sound came out of the Philips speaker, and the volume buttons worked. (So did the night light button, which doesn't use the phone.) And the clock on the face of the device automatically set to the time on my phone. Next I tried the included alarm clock app, which worked great and was very easy to use.They include a free music sync/play program which I did not bother using, as I'm happy with how it works already.Soon after plugging in the phone I got a message \"\"updated firmware available.\"\" Now, I'm a technical guy and I know this means \"\"cool, they are offering to upgrade my speaker's built-in software for free.\"\" But what's an average person supposed to think of this message? Anyhow, I let it upgrade and then edited my review because this upgrade fixed some problems in automatic docking/undocking.Now for the bad news.The volume buttons on the speaker do not change the volume on the phone, they only change how much the speaker multiplies it -- so if you want to \"\"crank it up\"\" you have to adjust the volume on the speaker AND on the phone.While the sound is quite good for a clock radio, it is not good enough to listen to music for hours. With acceptable bass but tinny treble and weak midrange, it could not be called \"\"high fidelity,\"\" nor can it play loud enough to satisfy a rock fan or a noisy party. You will still want to plug into your \"\"real\"\" stereo (or headphones or earbuds) for serious listening. That makes this more of a \"\"super clock\"\" and less of a \"\"stereo replacement\"\".\"", "There aren't a ton of options for those of us with Android phones (Evo 3D) that want to have a great speaker/docking station. This is a great one but my issue lies in the app. Once I downloaded Fidelio form the Market, it was frustrating to deal with the constant disconnects or it kept opening repetitively. I thought there was something wrong with my phone so I read the reviews on the Market and a lot of people are having the issue. The sheer bugginess of this app is unacceptable, and the reason why I can't give this great docking speaker five stars.It is a more than worthwhile device (even if the app needs an update). The sound is great quality. The clock works. The footprint is a bit odd, a circle, I had to clear some space for it on the nightstand. Overall, it is worth it.", "My wife really liked this as a gift. Sometimes it can be a bit tricky to set the phone in but once placed on the stand it is good to go and with a little practice it becomes easier. My wife does complain that the clock is hard to set and she hates it when we lose power and she has to reset it.", "\"I must say I'm quite impressed with the design and quality of the AS111/37. It's got a terribly user-unfriendly name, but this is one sexy little beast. The compact design is elegant, modern, and sophisticated.. not to mention shiny. I'm going to call this \"\"the puck\"\" from now on because AS111/37 is ugly sounding.The perspective shots in the product photography really do not do the unit justice. They make the dock look really fat and bulgy, but in reality, the sides are not tapered. It's more like a giant hockey puck (or if you prefer, a chocolate baumkuchen because it's the same size and shape) than anything else. The first picture is most accurate. It looks great in any room, even the kitchen, where I have it for product testing.First of all, the manual recommends that you install Fidelio and Songbird. I agree with this recommendation, as the puck is hard or impossible to use otherwise. Most, if not all, of the features, like the alarm timer, sleep timer, and internet radio, cannot be configured or used at all. There are precisely 4 physical buttons on the dock itself and no way to access the features. They are 4: +/- volume, power, and brightness dimmer. The brightness dimmer toggles the LCD clock brightness between 3 levels. If the power is on, it also toggles the nightlight floor lighting underneath the unit. Oddly, if the power is off, you cannot turn on the nightlight. The buttons are not raised or textured, so finding them in the dark may be a problem. They are also spread across each side of the dock at opposite ends from each other, not grouped together. - is on left, + on the right, power in front, and dimmer behind the backboard.If for some reason you cannot login to the Android Market to download these apps (because, say, you borrowed the phone from your brother and he won't tell you his password), the dock is still usable as a speaker via Bluetooth pairing. Pairing is not as difficult as the manual implies. It only took me 3 or 4 tries. Turn on the phone's Bluetooth discoverability and push scan. It should recognize the Philips after a few seconds. The manual does not say to turn on Bluetooth discoverability on your phone, so I'm writing this here in case that bit of info helps you. Once paired, you can play your music through the speakers. Your phone can be in the next room or wherever. It doesn't have to be docked. The volume controls are independent: the phone's volume is independent of the speaker's volume. You turn the phone way down and the speakers way up, for example. The puck can get quite loud when the phone volume is high and the speaker volume is high. I did not try to max out both, in consideration of sleeping neighbors. Sound quality is very good for a clock-radio, with a good amount of bass. I don't expect high fidelity sound reproduction from a clock-radio, but the puck more than delivers.As for the USB connector itself, I think it could've been done a lot better. Because of the wide variety of Android phone shapes and sizes, Philips decided to make a weird sliding, pivoting dock port with thumbwheels that raise and lower risers. I was really perplexed by the sticker on the dock until I fiddled around with the knobs. My test phone has a slightly curved bottom, so it sits uneasily on the riser pegs, tall and wiggly. It doesn't feel very stable. If your phone's port is on the left or right side, you can slide the dock left or right to center it against the backboard. (Mine has an Android guy sticker on it.) Maybe Phillips didn't have much of a choice designing a universal dock that fits all the different shapes and sizes of Android phones in the market, but I think it could've been done better. I imagine one clumsy drowsy arm swipe when reaching for the snooze button would cause your phone to go flying and possibly damage the connector.Overall, a very solidly crafted speaker dock, other than the USB connector. Much better than I thought it would be. Lastly, the product is minimally packaged, with only 2 or 3 bags for the manuals and AC adapter, and no styrofoam/plastic molds to throw out. The carton inside is paperboard. Kudos to Philips for thinking about the environment too.\"", "I like this dock because it is small, and charges my phone while playing music.  Doesn't take up alot of space.", "This is the first docking speaker in our home made specifically for Android.  Prior to this past weekend we only had one Andriod phone so there wasn't much need for it, but with the addition of two more Android phones it will get much more use.  Being familiar with thePhilips Fidelio DS1100 Speaker Dock with Clock for iPod/iPhone (White)I own already, thePhilips AS111/37 Fidelio Docking Speaker for Androidwas easy to begin using. I downloaded the recommended app and found that it was much more user friendly and helpful that the version I had tried with my iPhone. It allows you to take advantage of all the dock has to offer and makes it much easier to do so.I have to say that the size and style of the dock is one of my favorite things about it. It's not too big (perfect for our bedside table) and I like the sleekness of the all black design. The night light when in use, casts a very warm glow that isn't intrusive and offers just enough light to navigate our bedroom in the dark. The first phone we used this with was theEVO 4g. Both docking and connecting through the bluetooth was simple and provided very good sound quality. The second phone used was the Samsung Galaxy S; docking provided a little more difficult with this phone because of the placement, but not impossible.  In the end I decided that bluetooth connectivity was the preferred connection form this phone.  Again the sound was very good; clear with just the right amount of bass and it didn't distort when turned up.Overall when it comes down to price, features and quality, I think this docking speaker is a great buy.", "This is a well engineered solution for those who are cutting the last tie to an iPod. Solid sound for it's size, decent sound projection and quality (remember only 4 watts), but rather adequate for a bed side unit. The DockStudio software provides Alarm Clock  and Weather functions, but don't install the SongBird software. It's not needed, has no exit function, is a battery leech, and takes a 3rd party uninstaller to remove.On the positive side the microUSB docking solution is extremely adjustable, and provides solid support for my S2 in the case. Quite happy with the product. The Bluetooth connection was immediate on connection and everything works quite well.Summary:Pros - Size, sound, ease of use, DockStudio software, loud alarmCons - No remote, SongBird software, location of dimmer switch", "I own quite a few Apple iPod/iPhone docks, but was always disappointed there aren't too many Android docks on the market (as my cell phone is the Android-based HTC Incredible).  So I was definitely excited to try out this product.  After a couple of months of using it, I have mixed feelings on it.Pros:- The ability to listen to music via Bluetooth.  None of my Apple docks have Bluetooth ability, so this feature really impressed me the first time I used it.  It's nice to have the speaker dock sitting on my nightstand while I am controlling the music in bed.- I really like the design and shape.  It's very modern-looking.  If you are using it as an alarm clock, it's slightly on the larger end, but definitely nothing that is a hindrance.- Sound quality is definitely capable.  Our master bedroom is huge and this speaker had no problem filling the room with loud sound.- You don't need to use the Philips apps to use the speaker.- I liked the optional nightlight on the base of the speaker.Cons:- The placement of the charging micro USB makes charging very difficult, based on your specific phone.  My HTC Incredible has the port on the side, at the bottom.  This is basically the worst possible spot, as I have to tilt the phone on its side, then curve the phone at an angle so it doesn't tip over.  I also needed to take my protective cover off any time I wanted to charge the phone.- I didn't find the free apps they created to be very user-friendly.  Fortunately, you are not required to use them.- Sometimes the Bluetooth connection was intermittent, even when I put the phone right next to the dock.Overall, despite some problems, I would say this is a nice speaker system/alarm clock for Android users.", "The dock itself is sturdy and works well. Just that every android phone is so different from the other, creating a generic dock is impossible. Samsung has the USB slot on top, some have on the side, some have on the bottom. Just hooking up the phone to the dock and keeping it in place is a pain. Also every phone seems have to a different version of android and they come with their own issues. If you really need a dock for your android phone, buy it. If you are simply looking for a cool toy, stay away.", "I have been looking for a decent speaker dock for a while for my Android phone, and after trying a friends other brand, I was happy to try out this Philips Dock. First, the device has a pretty small footprint, which is nice compared to my old iPod speaker dock. The small design allows you to put it on a small nightstand or table. The sound quality is great in my opinion. I know others have complained a bit about the sound, but my music sounds great when played through the Philips dock, so I'm not sure what the difference is with their device or maybe my ears? If you are looking for a speaker dock for your Android phone, you should consider this Philips device, as I am happy with it.", "I applaud Philips on their engineering of the sound and ease of starting out.  Less than a minute from out of the box to playing Pandora off the phone.  They knocked it out of the park in that respect. Bluetooth hookup was under ten seconds!! Sound was good - almost mellow.Where I have my concern regarding this device is the mini-usb connector.  It sits in the center of the device and with some phones, will be facing the wrong way (as a charger for kindle fire... this would be an issue too - :))  The male connector on the device slides a bit both side to side and back forward to allow for various devices to be placed on it. My concern is that rough handling, animals, extended use... insert your thought here, could all cause catastrophe with the female connection from whatever device is attached.  I like the concept - but I think I would invest in an extender cable so my expensive electronics are not left sitting so precariously.All the best,Jay", "I bought this to charge my nexus 7 on, it won't charge it but will sync up via bluetooth. Sort of pointless... I then tried my ATT GS2 (i777) and that charges and syncs but the dock doesn't connect via the charging port, it actually uses bluetooth for some reason and my GS2 kept disconnecting and reconnecting.I'm returning this, it's pointless in my life because it won't charge my Nexus 7, and my phone the alarm on it is not reliable because because the bluetooth keeps dropping...", "It looks like Philips has discontinued its entire line of Fidelio docks/speakers with Android & Bluetooth support. Their website still lists a bunch of Apple-compatible speakers, but if you want one for your Android, there are almost no options left. I bought one of these a couple years ago and just now decided to get another one before they are too hard to find and cost a ridiculous amount. The next best option that comes up if you search for an Android speaker dock or alarm clock is the iHome one. But that one doesn't have Bluetooth which is a huge selling point for me on this.What I like:[+] The clock. There are many other speakers that function only as speakers, but I wanted to put one of these in each bedroom to function as the room's sole clock[+] Sound. No, it is not studio-quality audio, but you should not set your expectations that high for a sub-$100 speaker dock. That said, I do appreciate the sound for what it is: a VAST improvement to my phone's built-in speaker (listening to music with the built-in phone speakers is like nails on a chalkboard)[+] Bluetooth. This is really the main selling point. Other speaker docks &#34;compatible&#34; with Android (such as the iHome) are really only compatible with a 3.5mm audio jack, which requires an analog cable that can degrade your audio compared to streaming through Bluetooth. You'll also get much more range with Bluetooth than being tethered to a little cable. I can take my phone to the next room without interrupting the audio. Any further and it will start to stutter though.[+] AC. I like having the power hardwired to an electrical outlet so I don't have to worry about replacing/recharging batteries. Some have both options, which would obviously be better than having only one.What I don't like:[-] The Philips Songbird app. Don't even bother downloading it; you don't need it and it is way worse than just connecting Pandora or iHeartRadio over Bluetooth.[-] The Nightlight. It does look kind of cool, but it absolutely does not light anything other than a two-inch radius beyond the dock. It has a low and high setting, and both of them are more just to make the dock look kind of cool; *not* for actually lighting your room or helping you navigate around the room in the dark.So overall, I would say if you are looking for something like this for your Android, this is one of the better ones and no longer in production, so act fast. Hopefully, however, Philips or another company will release another speaker dock with true Android support that is an upgrade to this unit. Until then, I highly recommend this.", "While not a &#34;bring the house down&#34; super sound system, the performance of this charging speaker is very impressive considering the very reasonable price and relatively small footprint. Excellent fidelity, reasonable bass, and good volume. True plug-and-play setup (pairing was almost automatic). Simple to dock and undock. I'm using it with a Samsung Galaxy S3 but was impressed with the easily adjustable mounting configuration for any (Android) device. I am pleased with it and highly recommend this product.", "I had the speaker dock for the iPhone, and I got this for a family member who has an android phone.  They work well, are simple to use.The unit is plugged in -- long cord so it reaches behind a bed -- and the time displayed on the unit is taken from the phone -- no need to set it.The only drawback is some slight feedback noise which I get from other external speakers (but not from the phone only).  I'm not sure what causes it; it is sporadic, and not a show stopper.This is a nice unit to have as a substitute for a bedside clock.Recommended.", "I have the old iOS version of this dock too. The one without Bluetooth.I love this dock! You don't need to download the Phillips app. You can connect to bluetooth without it. If you want to use an alarm choose from the countless great ones on the Google Play app store.Great sound. Also you can turn the usb port 180 degree in case your phone has it reversed too. You'd be surprised how many phones have reversed USB ports.I really hope Phillips continues to make these types of docks moving forward. I have two now and the competition in this area is just weak. This dock 100% rules.", "I'm listening to smooth jazz via Pandora on my Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 (SGP for the rest of this review) through the Philips Fidelio as I type this, and it's quite nice.  I'll admit, I wasn't expecting much when I ordered this, but color me surprised!This device is meant to be a bedside alarm clock/speaker dock for your Android device.  So, I'm sure some people may wonder, but no, it does not run on batteries, so while it is small enough to be portable, you can't pack it and take it with you to the beach.The Fidelio connects to your Android device via Bluetooth and there is a micro USB plug you can use to attach your device for charging only; it cannot be used for synching.  Also, in regards to the USB docking connector, it can slide left and right and can also swivel and tilt, allowing for the dock to be used with virtually any Android handheld device (as long as it uses a micro USB plug).  This flexibility does come at a price, though, as it makes the connection seem flimsy and weak, and I worry about repeatedly docking my SGP and removing it.  Time will tell.  I also think that it would've been nice if the dock also swiveled up to allow me to use my SGP in landscape mode to watch videos, but because the jack is on the bottom, it's portrait-only.The unit itself is a disc about an inch and a half tall and six inches or so in diameter, with shiny black plastic around and a mesh on the entire top where the speakers are.  On the front of the dock is a dot-matrix clock (which I find quite nice) and a blue indicator light to show when the speakers are on.  In the center of the top is a flat, tall, clear tab sticking about an inch or two straight out the top and right in front of that, the adjustable micro USB dock connector.  Both sit centered on the control panel that controls the power, volume, and night light (with two levels of brightness).  The buttons are actual buttons and not touch-sensitive; there is a distinct click when you push them.  The front center button is the power/snooze button and flanking that are the volume buttons.Now, a major design flaw to me is the light button, which sits BEHIND where your Android device goes.  So, if your phone/MP3 player docks in landscape mode, expect to have to fumble around to turn on the glowing orange night light that emit from the bottom of the dock.  This is only made worse by the fact that your device is only attached by that small, flimsy micro USB connector; I'd be worried that in a late-night stupor, I might snap off the connector while trying to turn on/off the night light.As far as pairing my SGP to the Fidelio went, it was a simple, painless process and I was listening to my music in less than a minute.  I tend to keep the volume on my music low when I use headphones (15-20%), so at first, when I started playing my music, I thought something was wrong because I didn't hear anything.  Only when I turned the volume up on both did I hear my music, and even at 30 on the dock and 50% on my SGP, it was still low, so I wouldn't expect this speaker to fill a loud or large room.While on the subject of music, however, I'm no audiophile, but I'm finding the Fidelio pleasant for listening to jazz while I'm sipping some coffee and reading my book.  The bass is subtle and the piano and sax clear.  I've also listened to some pop and rock music and it's much better than any small/portable speaker I've tried.  I'm very impressed by the audio from this little device.The box and instructions directed me to the Android Market to download the Fidelio app and Songbird to use the speaker, but when I read the poor reviews (app crashes, glitches, system resource hog, etc.), I decided to see if I could get it to work without using Philip's app.  Verdict:  It works wonderfully on Android 2.3.5 Gingerbread!  I streamed music off Pandora and AAC files directly from my music app.  I also watched a video I converted and it all sounded great!  Nice and clear.  So if you're worried about downloading yet another third-party app, fear not; it's not necessary.In summary, the Fidelio is a fantastic near-universal Android dock with great sound quality.  With the exception of the location of the light button and some sturdiness issues in regards to the dock connector, it's intelligently designed to handle most handheld Android devices, is very easy to use (so easy the instructions are only pictures, no words), and offers fantastic audio quality in a small package.  An easy four stars!", "I really wanted to like this - I need a good docking station for my Motorola Droid phone, and this one looked like it could fit the bill.  Looks, however, are deceiving.  I also consider myself pretty much up to speed with electronics and gadgets, but this thing exasperated me to no end.Opening the box you have the unit, a power cord, a poster-sized quick start guide, and the standard warranty that tells you about all of the bad things that can happen if you do something the unit was not designed to do.  Plugged it in, got my phone out, and it won't fit on the charger unless I take the protective cover off of the phone and then wiggle it around to secure it.  The Motorola Droid phone still manages to wiggle off slightly from the charger, causing the clock to make a pretty loud beep.  Put it back on the charger again, this time more secure, and it manages to wiggle off 5 minutes later.  With another beep that wakes up the person next to you.Strike one, as the iPod / iPhone compatible units we have around the house don't require you to take off the cover each time - and I'm talking about a standard cover, not something that is really thick with a lot of bling, either.The unit will not pair up with your phone until you download a free app from the Android Market called Fidelo.  It's not very good, either, and it has a whole string of 1-star reviews to its credit.  I installed the app and followed the visual quick start guide (there really aren't any written words of substance on the quick start guide).  After two attempts, the Fidelo app (made by Philips) finally recognized the unit also made by Philips.The radio feature would not work at all, even connected to a 5-bar strength WiFi network, and was continually buffering.  Since the radio portion of the app won't work, the radio feature of what I was hoping to be a clock radio wouldn't work.As the radio feature wouldn't work, I tried to play some mp3 songs I had on my phone.  They wouldn't play through the unit's speakers, but would on my phone.  I could always play songs on my phone, but it would be really nice to be able to play them through the speakers on this unit.  Maybe if there were some written instructions vs. a graphical quick start guide users could get this feature to work.If you can manually set the alarm - say you don't have your phone with you but you still want to set the alarm feature, the graphical instructions say you could do it (it had an icon), but I'll be ^&*$#! If I could get that to work, either.  I pushed where the graphic said push and it the clock just stared at me.  Grinning.Since the alarm, radio, and speakers could not be made to operate - maybe it does, but that would require the manufacturer to devote less space on the poster-sized quick start guide to pictures and maybe print some words with instructions you could follow - this thing is nothing more than an LED clock with a two-power nightlight.", "I am really happy with this speaker/docking station.  It has an awesome sound and is perfect for my office.  The only &#34;complaint&#34; I have is the way the phone docks sitting up.  It seems rather precariously perched on top.  Otherwise no complaints.", "Ok first off, I'm going to admit when I'm wrong. There are reviews in here that *hint* at this not being a quite so awesome product, and I should have listened.But NOOOOOO, I gleefully waited for the UPS man to drop off my smiley face Amazon package, ripped it open and began trying to use it.1st time -  I tried to put my Samsung Note 2 on the dock....hmmm a little wobbly but ok.2nd time - Oh, what's the little black bar thingy in the package, maybe that will help stabilize it. NoooooGreat - my $600 phone is perched on the clock speaker thing - with a way to bright clock face that has numbers that I can't really read. As one reader put it - its 2013 should a LCD display be a problem to make? - (i digress) waiting to fall off.I was actually afraid to touch my phone on it and it was impossible to put my phone on it without 2 hands. The usb connector moves back and forth to accommodate different sized phones. Great for when I'm in bed, now I gotta get up and put it back on the damned thing.Maybe this is made for smaller phones.Maybe I don't have the dexterity needed to use this.Maybe Phillips could have actually USED this before the decided to sell it...I don't know.I couldn't put this thing back into the box fast enough. This is going back right freaking now.", "So far so good with this device. There are some occasional software glitches with the app you have to download to your phone. As long as they don't continue or at least happen too often I can deal with it. The app itself is a bit limited and include some options I have no interest in. Hopefully Philips will update it over time and include more options.The build seems okay. I'm not really crazy about the way the phone docks. Seems like an accident waiting to happen. I don't care much for the flat touch buttons on the device either. The glowing base might not appeal to everyone but I have no issues with it. I did a lot of searching for an android docking alarm clock. Most others had poor reviews and few options. I think manufacturers are making a mistake by offering so few android peripherals.", "In a world where there are a large variety of iPhone and iPod speaker docks and clock radios, I was happy to see that Philips is producing good sounding speaker docks for the Android platform. With the debut of the Philips AS111/37 Fidelio Docking Speaker for Android, Philips has made an affordable Android docking speaker/clock radio that both looks and sounds good.The Philips Android speaker dock is small and cylinder shaped, looking somewhat futuristic. It's all black, with just a snooze, volume and clock/nightlight buttons on the top. The unit itself is plastic, with fabric on top, covering the speakers. The top also has the dock for an Android phone, and the dock itself moves back and forth to fit any phone. The speaker dock also has an amber night light. Although the speaker dock is small, it produces very good sound and a balanced tone. I streamed music from both Pandora and Slacker, as well as music on my phone, I am very pleased with the sound this speaker dock produces. Highs are clear, and there's a good amount of bass present as well. The unit gets louds, and at its loudest setting, 32, it does not distort. Music plays wirelessly; the phone docks to the unit for charging purposes only. The Bluetooth connection is very effortless; the speaker dock found and connected with my phone almost immediately.So that's the good news. Now here is the bad news. Because the speaker dock has so few buttons or controls, you need an app to control the alarm clock function. Philips wants you to download its Fidelio app, but the app is pretty large, (it may be a resource hog on your phone) and buggy.The instructions, which are very bare (just a series of drawings, no real written instructions) don't really tell you much, so you have to sort of feel your way around the app to figure things out. It took me a while to find the actual alarm function on the app, which is not good if you are half asleep trying to adjust the alarm. I would suggest downloading any of the free Alarm apps available in the Android market. They are much less of a resource hog, have more features, and will not be as buggy. Waking up to music on my phone, such as Slacker, Pandora, or Sirius, is not possible, since my phone is password protected. The alarm does turn the phone on, but you have to enter a password to hear music. The alarm app will wake you to music that you have installed on the phone, or to a series of sounds (rain, waves, etc.).I have an HTC Incredible phone, which means my phone has to sit horizontal on the connector since my charging input is on the side of the phone. The phone is somewhat hard to connect to the dock, and then once connected falls off easily since it is sitting on its side. Again, if you are trying to use this in the dark, it may be very hard (and frustrating) to connect the phone to the speaker dock.Overall, I applaud Philips for putting out a great sounding speaker dock for an Android device. I use the Bluetooth to connect to the speaker, and enjoy listening to music. But I have to give this unit only three stars because of the weak Fidelio app and poor support for phones that have to sit horizontally on the connector. As a speaker dock, purely on sound, I would rate this unit a four, but the app (and a limited alarm function) brings to score down to a three.", "\"I have been wishing for an Android compatible docking speaker for a while, so I was super excited when I saw this one was available from Philips. The sound really is fantastic for such a small speaker.PROS:*I LOVE the bluetooth feature. I can be checking my e-mail on my smartphone and jamming out to my favorite music through the speakers at the same time. I've even used it when I'm watching movies on my phone.*It's a great size. Perfect for nightstands, shelves, or entertainment centers.*You can adjust the volume from where you're sitting. It turns your phone into a remote control for the stereo.*The nightlight provides the perfect amount of light.CONS:*I seriously dislike the Fidelio App. It made my phone act spastic and so I finally uninstalled it. It kept searching and trying to connect via bluetooth even when I did not want to be connected to the speakers. When I would log in to try to \"\"disconnect\"\" from the speaker it would start running the app all over again. It seemed like the App would start of it's own accord. Maybe it's user error on my part, but I got irritated with the constant issues with the Fidelio app. I just started using Pandora or Amazon Cloud and connecting to the speaker through my phone's regular Bluetooth connection. That worked just fine. I think there are a still bugs they'll need to work through.*The actual docking station doesn't seem especially sturdy. It does allow you to adjust the \"\"supports\"\" on either side of the micro-usb, but due to the small size of the micro-usb it doesn't seem quite as sturdy as the iPod models. It doesn't really seem to cradle my phone especially well (I have a HTC Inspire).*FYI - if you use a super hefty protective case for your phone (like an Otterbox) you will have to remove your case before being able to dock the phone. It was a bit of a hassle to constantly take the phone cover on and off, but it's not Philips fault that I have to use a tank to protect my phone from my two-year-old.To sum up, this docking speaker has fantastic sound, especially for it's small size. The Bluetooth feature is fantastic and I love that it's compatible with my android phone. I'm not currently a fan of the Fidelio app, but I'm hopeful that they'll continue to do updates and work out any current bugs or glitches. I wished my phone could dock with the protective case on, but again, that's my choice to have the cover and isn't Philips fault that my phone is wrapped in tank-like fashion.\"", "This is a very high quality, portable sound system that I've used as a portable radio and docking station while on the road.  I took it with me on my last trip and it worked like a charm as a portable alarm and the Fidelio app was great when it came to loading loading Christmas music to play on my phone as background music. The app was easy to load and offered a lot of features to make the alarm a pleasant wake up experience.The sound is fantastic and can fill the room if you turn it up.  I usually keep it around 5-12 sound level, but from high to low the sound was clean, bright and enjoyable.  My phone is an htc desire and the adjustable feet on the docking system secured it to the base without a problem.  I was also able to pair the speaker with my iPad so watching movies on my iPad sounded even better with the Philips docking system.I'm very pleased with this unit and look forward to many years of quality service paired with fantastic sound."], "Gamma": [0.03145234286785126, 0.031512387096881866, 0.031512629240751266, 0.031512387096881866, 0.031512387096881866, 0.031512387096881866,
