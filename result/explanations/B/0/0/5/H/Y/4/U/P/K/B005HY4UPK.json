Having the second charging connection is great as my wife's phone can be charging at the same time. Either I don't know how to do it but the phones notifications sounds don't play through the speakers. I have only had this docking station a few days and don't know every little nuance it has. The price range is wide spread for this model but it appears to be a little pricey. Otherwise I would have given it another star.", "I've found it enjoyable to listen to music using this docking station. I use it more than expected because it's how I power up the phone. Whereas the docking station charges my phone and my iPad, I'm unlikely to use the batteries and go portable although one never knows until occasions arise.The Fidelio app is cool for getting classical music, which agrees with me during work. On the basis of ease and versatility of use, sound quality and appearance, I like this docking station. The sound quality beats what comes directly from the phone, so this is a welcome peripheral.", "I received this for my Android and I have to say what a pleasant surprise. Great sound, easy setup, love the way the connector adjusts for any phone and is very compact. If you are looking for something to entertain you while you're working in the yard, garage or have folks over this is a perfect solution.", "This speaker dock has several pros and cons in my opinion. I will start with the pros.Pros:1. The speakers have a sharp and clear sound.2. The dock is portable and can be used indoors with the included a/c adapter or outdoors, etc. with batteries.3. Not only does the dock work with Android devices, but it worked well with my iPad through bluetooth.4. The flexi-dock can be adjusted to work optimally with your phone.Cons:1. The Fidelio software. When I tried to find it in my Android Market, I got 'unavailable' messages. I finally used the online chat support with less than satisfactory results. It finally occurred to me that I might just need to update my phone's operating system. Sure enough, once that was accomplished, the software was available in my Market and installed quickly. Why did the tech support not ask if my phone was compatible? Once the software was installed, it crashed repeatedly when I tried to use it. Not only that, but it would constantly turn on my phone's bluetooth and run down the battery searching for a connection - even when miles away from the dock. Needless to say, I uninstalled Fidelio immediately. After all that trouble, I found that the software is not even necessary although the manual indicates that it is.2. The dock does not work so well with phones that connect at the top. Even out of its case and even with the versatile flexi-dock, I still had difficulty connecting my phone. Once it was connected, it charged much slower than my usual charger. I could plug my phone into the jack at the rear of the dock but I prefer using my usual method instead.So, if you are just looking for a pretty good sounding portable speaker dock to pair with your bluetooth device, the Philips Fidelio Docking Speaker for Android is a decent choice. I would recommend that you ignore the instructions to install the Fidelio software.", "The Philips AS351 Fidelio Bluetooth speaker dock for Android is one of four similar products that Philips recently released to consumers.  It has some compelling features, as usual for a Philips product, but it doesn't have the typical Philips value.PROS:- Sound quality is reasonably good- Powerful enough to fill a small room very well- Charges Android smartphone in dock- Secondary USB port for simultaneous charging of another device- AUX-in for playing non-Bluetooth devices through speaker- Runs on 4 AA batteries and via AC adapterCONS:- Doesn't dock smoothly- Finicky connection at times- Not competitively pricedWhen I think of Philips, the first thing I think of is good value.  I own a Philips alarm clock, portable DVD player, and a full-sized DVD player.  All of them work well, have been durable, and best of all, didn't cost me an arm and a leg.  At just over $90 online, The AS351 Fidelio isn't priced as competitively as I would've expected.SOUND QUALITYThe sound quality of the AS351 Fidelio is reasonably good.  Bass response is particularly good, but doesn't overwhelm the mids or highs too much.  It can also get pretty loud, without distortion.  I sometimes crank it up in the kitchen while I'm prepping meals for my kids or when I'm working at the dining table.  The dual 3-inch speakers have a total output of 10W (RMS).  While not exactly a high-end speaker system, the AS351 is nice for casual listening and parties.USAGE & FEATURESThe AS351 can be used via wireless Bluetooth or through the AUX-in connection.  I've tried the speakers with a Philips Android MP3 player as well as my HTC Droid Incredible 2 smartphone.  Both devices worked well with both connections.  Unfortunately, the speakers and my Android devices fail to connect about 25% of the time and I'm left to connect them manually.The dock allows you to keep your Android device propped up on the speakers and simultaenously charges them (AC adapter-only).  The dock connector is a micro USB plug which can be rotated 360 degrees to allow phones with different port orientations to connect to the dock, facing out.  It's a smart design.  There's no guide to align your device, however, so it's not always easy to connect to the dock on the first try.The power and volume buttons are easy to see and work well when pressed.  They're lit, so you can see them even in dimly lit rooms.  The Bluetooth connectivity indicator blinks when no device is connected, and turns solid once connected.The AS351 Fidelio speaker dock can be run on four AA batteries, in addition to the AC adapter. Run time is estimated at around 8 hours.  Note that when running on batteries, it will not charge your Android device.  Still, the ability to operate on battery power is nice for flexibility in placement and when you want to take it traveling or to an event.  Also, it's worth mentioning that there is a spare USB port at the back of the AS351 to allow it to charge a secondary device when plugged into a wall outlet.  I keep a micro USB cable plugged in so I can charge my phone, even when the speakers are off.CONCLUSIONThe Philips AS351 Fidelio Bluetooth speaker is a nice speaker dock for Android devices.  It has a good set of features and sounds reasonably good for a speaker of this size.  My biggest disappointment is its price, however.  There are several other Bluetooth speakers by other manufacturers that are around the same price as the AS351, which means that cost is not a differentiating feature of the Philips speaker.  I still recommend it, but I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to take a look at speakers from Logitech or Altec Lansing first.", "\"This product is great in every way. It's sound is good. It can be paired by bluetooth, or 1/8\"\" stereo cable. It can charge your phone while it is docked-- or if your phone isn't compatible with the dock setup, an auxiliary wire can be use to charge your phone. Finally, you can power it off of AA batteries! I don't think it will charge your phone when battery powered.If you're looking for something that sounds incredible you won't find it at this price and battery powered. It your looking for something that sounds better than your phone's speaker, better than your average computer speakers, and about as good as book shelf system, this is it.I suppose if you're not planning to ever use the portability afforded by being able to power with AA batteries, there are less expensive docks with similar sound quality.The dock setup.... either works great for your phone or doesn't. I have an evo 4G and it sits perfectly atop the device. My wife's evo design 4g, with power on the side can't be docked.\"", "I purchased one of these so that I could play music out by the pool and while grilling and any other place that I would be remotely. At first the product was great. There are a few things that bugged me.1. The connector is kind of flimsy and will not charge your phone if not connected *perfectly*. So make sure your phone is charging before walking away!2. Sometimes it looses blutooth connection while playing music. This is highly annoying!3. The Philips app is crap4. After a while the thing crapped out on me. Initially the sound was fantastic, good bass, nice midrange. However, one day it just started sounding horrible right in the middle of playing some music(at a reasonable volume). It never recovered. Any music with any kind of low tones or bass would result in ear curdling static type sound. It was BAD.Amazon support was amazing in this regard. One reason why I love shopping with amazon is their support. They helped me return this item very quickly and refunded my money.", "This is a Good basic docking speaker for the Android but nothing special, sound is weak and not very rich. I've heard others that cost the same and sound much better, you can do better foryour $100. The dock itself works well, it's easy mating up and removing. No remote with this dock, some will be disappointed because of this. It has battery back-up but usually runs on AC power.", "If you're looking for a smaller self-contained Android speaker dock, give this one a try. If you don't have much space on your table or desk, this one is nice because it is one piece with a small footprint. Sound is pretty good for a small unit, though of course it doesn't compare with higher powered separate stereo speakers. Bluetooth is easy to setup and doesn't seem to degrade audio quality. The micro-USB power port works well and is more stable than it looks.Philips does have a couple of Android apps that are designed to work with this dock. Reviews for the apps are poor and features seem limited, so I didn't bother installing it. Numerous high quality audio apps are already available for Android and they work fine with this dock. Android's standard Bluetooth features also work fine with this dock. I run the Bluetooth for several hours at a time at my desk with no problems. Since the dock charges your phone at the same time it powers the speakers, you don't have to worry about your phone's battery running down even if you keep the screen on all the time.I haven't tried the battery power mode yet, but that could be useful if you're using this dock outdoors or in the garage away from a power outlet.My only issue with this product is the astronomical price, but huge discounts are sometimes available.", "There are few docking stations made specifically for Android phones, which makes the Philips Fidelio even more valuable.  Recommended for Android phone users who are tired of having their audio sent over devices specialized for the iPod.  The Fidelio, a name which is engenders wary smiles and giggles from teenagers, has an innovative slide docking station that should accommodate any Android based phone.  THose with part of the music on their phone and the rest on another device will enjoy the Bluetooth synching feature.  The product is very easy to pair your table, PC or other device with the Fidelio creating a mobile music space that takes full advantage of all of your devices.  The bluetooth feature is the main feature I use and it has transformed the way I listen to music.Now to the most important part, the sound.  Overall the Fidelio provides good midrange sound that does not distort when you crank it up.  The bass sound on the device is the weakest part, under powered as there does not appear to be a separate base speaker.  The result is more of a missing base line than an overly tinny sound that normally happens when playing a heavy base sound without base speakers.Overall, its a wonder that there are not more Android enabled devices or more that take advantage of bluetooth connectivity.  That combination makes the Fidelio a strong consideration for those who have Android phones or will get them this holiday season.  People without Android phones may want to consider using the Fidelio as a wireless speaker system via the blue tooth connection, which opens the market to anyone with an iPhone, iPod Touch or other bluetooth enabled device.Recommended as a gift for others or as a gift for yourself.", "No question that this is a nice little set of speakers for those without a larger music system. It's probably ideal for your first stereo, now that you've graduated to being a teenager--because this is essentially a variation of the old boom box. It provides adequate sound quality for today's younger generation, though listeners with more discriminating ears will find the dynamic range of the speakers to be a bit on the low side. As a result, this product is over-priced and might be a useful addition to your collection of electronics if it sold for half as much or less.The instructions, printed on a single sheet of over-sized paper and written in sixteen languages, makes one appreciate what the world must have been like before the Tower of Babel.Two major disappointments:1. A standard feature of most such electronics is the inclusion of a giant brick plug. There is clearly room inside the case of this product for the transformer, and it has become more than irritating that manufacturers continue to force brick plugs on the consumer simply because the manufacturer isn't willing to design the product for the market it serves. (And to anticipate and answer any criticism of this view--yes, I *would* pay a bit more for the *absence* of a brick plug. I have over a hundred of them already, thank you, and no two of them are compatible with anything else.)2. Not visible in the photo is the ability of the charging port to slide left and right rather than living in the center. But if Philips had only put TWO charging ports in that otherwise unoccupied space, the product might have been worth the price. Imagine, if you will, a household in which there are TWO people, TWO phones, and both phones charge in the same unit requiring only one preferably non-brick plug.Postscript: Do NOT install the Fidelio Android App unless you need it for a specific purpose; it is wholly unnecessary for the normal operation of the speaker system and doesn't function well. Philips recommends the Songbird Music App, which does work pretty well, so if you don't already have a music player app, Songbird can do the job.", "It's unfortunate that due to a minor design flaw and a piece of plastic, it could be a perfect sound system for many devices.  Just one example is Amazon's Kindle Fire.  It's Android, it will work, but you need an adapter, however, it will not rest in the base.  It is pretty much created for phone use only, but the wide base just make no sense.  i.e. the Kindle Fire is the perfect size for this, but a stupid plastic part is in the way of the power port.  I even called Phillips, because this would have been an outstanding choice for the Fire, and they admitted that is was a careless design flaw.  They did take a lot of notes and details on what I was doing and how I was trying to use it, and basically told me it's likely going to have a more accommodating and customizable setup in future models.But, for the price, if your phone or device is compatible, it's a pretty good deal for the sound quality.  It does fill the room with music, and though larger than it needs to be, is still portable.  It also serves as a charger which is a major plus.  There are plenty of speaker docks out there, and this is just another, but I give it the 4 stars as the quality is there, but the design is lacking.  Be sure to check if your device will fit.The software of Fidelio and Songbird are just useless.  I don't even know why they try anymore.  There is no need for it or the app.  It will work without it just fine.", "\"I was in the market for a speaker and dock for my Nexus S. As luck would have it, this Philips Fidelio dock was being offered on Amazon and I jumped on the deal. Its a great dock for free, but most people aren't going to be given this for free, and if you're considering buying this as a gift, you better know what the person is going to get. First off, the good. Obviously, the dock looks pretty good. It sounds pretty decent. Its not mind blowing but it gets pretty loud. In that regard its like a really nice cock radio. They also had the forethought to put a \"\"aux in\"\" on the back (and included a headphone cable!) that you can use to plug in your iPod or other audio source to play out through the unit. The actual USB connection to the phone is very good, you can slide the connector, rotate it and generally get it so your phone sits nice and pretty on its musical throne.However, the big problem with this setup is the software that Philips wants you to download. Not one, but two apps. Both are free, but its a bit of a pain to have to set up software for a speaker stand. Especially when its not necessary. The first app is called Fidelio and is made by Philips. I honestly didn't bother to see what it could do. It spent a good couple of minutes trying to pair (over bluetooth) with the speaker stand to no avail. Looks like a clock app with that extra feature of automatically pairing with the speaker stand.The other app is Songbird, a third party app used to manage and sync playlists across your computers and your Android phone. Its fairly well known, though I don't use it (i'm already pretty entrenched with Rdio and Google Music). So again, a step I skipped mainly because I just wanted a charging stand and a speaker dock. Why Philips doesn't just tell you to pair the dock and phone using the built in bluetooth feature is beyond me. Whatever, the thing works the way I want it to. I guess if I really wanted to I could install Songbird at some later time.If I had an office, this would look and work great for me. Again, don't bother with the included software unless you feel obligated to follow directions.\"", "\"Don't let the \"\"dock\"\" in the product title fool you - while you *can* dock and charge your phone, the communication with your Android device is over Bluetooth. Once paired (a 15 second thing), you can start listening to music on this speaker. Sound is as good as you'll find in this price range - and on par with the Altec Lansing and JBL iPhone speaker products. You can remove your device from the dock and keep listening, and you can control things using the dock buttons.As some others have pointed out, your device won't fit in this when in its case, though that may not apply to devices with a very thin case (like on my Amaze 4G). Some (mostly tablet devices) can't charge over MicroUSB, but they'll still stream music.All in all, the only downside is the price - there are some other Bluetooth speaker dock options out there, but none designed specifically for Android devices. If you can ignore the price a little, then this is a definite \"\"must buy\"\" if you like your music.\"", "\"I got this not knowing what to think, thinking mostly that I wouldn't like it. I never thought that I had a need for something like this, but now that I have used it for a week, it's something I can't seem to live without. It fills a need that I honestly didn't know I had.A bit of background: I listen to a lot of podcasts and music. I listen to podcasts on a portable media player, and listen to music via my Android phone using Amazon's own Cloud Player. Before getting this dock, I would use headphones with both of those devices, even when at home, because it was just convenient, and I really didn't have a convenient method of connecting them to a sound system. Doing so requires changing cables and swapping devices, and I just can't be bothered.All of that said, this speaker dock is incredibly easy to use. The back of the device has an audio-in jack, and an included cable, that allows you to connect any device that has a standard headphone jack to it. Plug the cable into the back of the speaker dock, and connect the other end of cable to your device, turn-up the volume to \"\"max\"\" on the connected device, and turn on the speaker dock. Couldn't be easier. I leave the connecting cable connected to the back of the dock for instant access. I use this method for listening to all the podcasts I have on my mp3 player.When it comes to my Android phone, the speaker dock has a bluetooth receiver. Pairing the device to my phone was easy and flawless. My phone recognized the speaker dock as a \"\"stereo\"\" headset/device. Once paired, I opened my Amazon Cloud Player, pressed play, and the music was transmitted to the speaker dock. It's very convenient, considering that you can sit anywhere in the room with the phone, and transmit music to this speaker dock sitting elsewhere.In other words, you don't have to \"\"dock\"\" the phone. This allows you to continue using your phone for other needs while it transmits music to the dock. If you choose to dock your phone, that too works great.Docking your phone is a bit tricky because it's a bit hard to guide the phone's jack onto the connector. The connector rotates on the base of the dock depending on the orientation needed for your phone. The dock has a rubber \"\"rest\"\" that the phone will lean against once docked, so the phone isn't supported by the jack. Also, there are two adjustable \"\"feet\"\" that you can raise to add support to the bottom edge of the phone, which keeps it from leaning \"\"back\"\" on the jack. The dock is ingenious that it slides back and forth, so you can center the phone, in the event the USB port is off-center. This allows for a \"\"perfect\"\" presentation when the phone is docked.When docked, the phone will charge via USB. I recommend changing your phone's settings so that, when docked, the display stays on, and that the screen auto-rotates. Some devices have \"\"docking\"\" cradle apps that assist with this. Your mileage may vary.Also, note, I did not have to download the recommended Fidelio software.So...what about sound quality? I really like it, and I should point out that I'm really picky. The sound is naturally-tuned. It is perfect for voices, and therefore for podcasts. The sound has a good low-end, not boomy, but good for music. The midrange, especially voices, is fairly flat, and the treble is good for general music listening. In general, I'd describe the overall sound-quality as \"\"natural and flat\"\" -- which is a good thing. Volume-wise, it puts out enough volume to listen to podcasts while wandering around the house to adjacent rooms. As expected, though, maximum volume is not recommended when listening to music (depending on the type). I am quite pleased with the sound.I also love that it runs on four AA batteries, in addition to the included AC adapter.So what keeps this device from being perfect?First, there's no \"\"mute\"\" button for the volume. If you need to quickly mute the device, to take a phone call, you can't -- you either have to power it off or hold the volume-down button to slowly lower the volume. A \"\"mute\"\" button, or a way to quickly mute (perhaps by pressing both volume buttons at the same time), would have been great.Second, I'm not a fan of the fabric covering. The top of the speaker dock is mostly fabric, which means it's going to collect dust and slowly get that \"\"grey\"\" look over time. It will be very hard to clean. I would have preferred a glossy surface for easy cleaning.Third, docking your phone covers the \"\"Android\"\" logo. It would be great if this logo were elsewhere, less prominently, on the speaker dock.Finally, I wish it had a \"\"release\"\" button or lever to eject the phone. Pulling-up on the phone always worries me since I seem to be putting undue stress on the jack. I would much prefer for the dock's connector to \"\"retract\"\" or that the base would push the phone \"\"up\"\" away from the connector.In general, though, I can't be happier with this dock, and I know it's something I will continue to use in my home several times a week.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0008199696312658489, 0.0010627044830471277, 0.08222020417451859, 0.00017860496882349253, 0.224460169672966, 0.07349476218223572, 0.214426651597023, 0.006876458413898945, 0.38605380058288574, 0.0012477588606998324, 0.0019397069700062275, 0.00010882944479817525, 0.00414717523381114, 0.00015965144848451018, 0.002803513780236244]]}
