"], "reviews": ["After many hits and misses (Dial; Irish Spring) we are a Dove soap family. We all love the way it keeps your skin feeling soft and never dry. I sometimes prefer liquid Dove but the men in my family prefer a bar of soap and this is now, by far, their favorite.", "I do not have sensitive skin but my father does and has been advised by his doctor in the past to use Dove to help with periodic redness and itching. So I was anxious to give this a try and see how it works for both an average user and one with more sensitive skin.Despite not especially liking cucumbers, I really liked this scent - not too overpowering with just the right combination of cucumber and green tea. Honestly, it doesn't really smell like either to me - it's just a nice, crisp, fresh scent that I think would appeal to anyone (not too sweet or feminine). I also found it to be more moisturizing than my regular soaps, which is especially nice in the drying winter months.As for my father, the aroma was fine for him (pretty much indifferent) and he did not have any of the severe reactions that some other reviewers have described. But while it was moisturizing, it seemed to him that this is a different formulation than the older, basic Dove soaps that his doctor suggested several years agoIf your skin is especially sensitive or you have any medical skin conditions, I would talk with your doctor first or test this out on a small area to be sure you won't have any adverse reactions. But for the average soap user, this is just a really nice, moisturizing soap in a fresh, new vibrant scent.", "My wife and I have both been using the regular Dove Beauty Bar soap for several years because of dry skin. The moisturizing cream in Dove has definitely helped to keep our skin from being so dried out. The Cool Moisture Beauty Bar has exactly the same effect, and the only difference that I've noticed with the Cool Moisture soap is a slightly different aroma. I also shampoo with it, although my wife prefers her own shampoo.We live in an area where the humidity is fairly high most of the year. Occasionally, we vacation in western states where the humidity is much lower than here, and we always pack a bar of Dove in addition to some moisturizing lotion.I'm sold on Dove, and I recommend the Cool Moisture bar soap for bathing, especially if you have dry skin problems.", "My husband has sensitive skin.  If he uses a soap with too much fragrance, he gets a slight rash  on his chest after about two times using it - even the &#34;natural&#34; scented soaps.  I can tolerate more scent them him but I also get a slight rash after prolonged use with a scented soap.  This is the only soap we've found that does not give us a rash so it is always in the shower.  I also like that it doesn't leave a scent on your skin so if I choose to wear a perfume, it doesn't clash.It's also a good soap to keep in the guest bath because both men & women can use it without being offended by a scent that is either masculine or feminine.", "\"The Dove \"\"go fresh cool moisture\"\" beauty bar with cucumber and green tea extract lathers up nicely and left my skin feeling silky.  I like the fresh scent, although I do wish the scent were even stronger.  I've tried other hydrating soaps before which almost disintegrate when using them; however, this bar does not do that. I would definitely consider purchasing this in the future as one of several bar soaps I really like (such as Lever 2000 and Camay). I also love the \"\"spring green\"\" color.\"", "We've used Dove products in our house for a long time. The soap itself cleans nicely and doesn't seem to leave a residue. It also doesn't seem to be as drying, especially in the winter when the dry heat sucks the moisture out of your skin.So really, the difference is in the scent. I've also used the Dove Cucumber Scented deodorant and I didn't like the scent. But I am really surprised at how fresh this smells. It has a very faint scent of Dove's cucumber smell but it is much more than that. It is just fresh and light and not flowery. I'm sure it would work for a man as much as a woman. I have my unused boxes sitting on a dresser and they've been acting as a room freshener for now as well! Not that I'm recommending that but just to point out that the scent is pleasing.", "For a long time I used nothing but body wash in the shower. It just became a habit to go for the bottle, instead of the bar. One day a local store had Dove Bar Soap on sale, and so I took advantage of that to pick up a couple of bars. As soon as I unwrapped a bar to place in the shower, the scent took me back to to when my grandmother used Dove, and how nice it always smelled when I would suds up the cloth or simply wash my hands. Also, I have always battled dry skin, and once I started using Dove again, I noticed that my skin was softer, less dry. Since then, Dove Bar has been my go to choice for the shower, and those bottles of body wash stay on the shelf.", "My mom always purchased Dove Bar soap...well, back then liquid soap wasn't an option.  Through the years, I tried several brands of bar soap; most of them were very drying & I always went back to Dove white or Dove pink.  I prefer Dove's original bar  soap to most of their new varieties.I don't like liquid soaps; however, my family does.  I figure why buy soap that's diluted with water when I can add my own.  I don't ban all liquid soaps; I buy some for their convenience.  For dry chapped hands my daughter & I useDove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture, Deep Moisture, 24 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)which is creamy & great for her hands which get chapped in the winter.I expect to be purchasing Dove Bar Soap...forever.", "but i already use dove specifically for since 1998. so i am a loyal fan. this one has to be one of those brands that works. yeah.", "I don't normally use bar soap, but I chose to take a bar with me on my recent mission trip to Africa to avoid taking yet another restricted size liquid bottle on the airplane.I was very pleased with this soap!  The part of Africa where we were was very, very dirty, and I had to wash several times per shower just to get the layers of dirt off.  This soap performed like a champion, and lasted for a long time!  Even when it ended up in a pool of water for a few hours, the bottom part became soft, but did not completely deteriorate as some bars would.  My skin never felt dried out after using it, either, despite all the washing I had to do.The fresh Cool Moisture scent was nice without being overwhelming.  In fact, using it reminded me of home on the days of my trip when I was particularly homesick.  I feel it is a unisex scent, not particularly flowery or girly in any way.My husband does use bar soap regularly, so I also have this in the shower for him.  He is pleased with its long lasting performance and fragrance as well.", "I grew up using other soaps but upon a doctor's recommendation years ago I switched to DOVE for sensitive skin.  This does not annoy my skin at all and it leaves it feeling soft but not slick or sticky.  It is safe to use on every part of my body and a bar lasts about three weeks for me.  Getting this large container means I only have to buy it once a year!", "Soap is a funny thing. The rich and famous soap themselves with ultra-fancy, handcrafted $20 a bar soap infused with rare oils and butters gathered from distant lands, while the down and out clean with ultra-cheap pennies-a-bar soap infused with all the chemicals modern science can muster. Then you have those middleclass soaps, the kind I grew up with. Dove. Irish Springs. Dial. All the classics.Dove always seemed a little bit fancier than the rest, with its contoured shape and famous &#8220;1/4 moisturizing lotion formula.&#8221; I don&#8217;t honestly know if it is any better than the rest, but it appears in my bathroom more often than the others.This is the &#8220;upscale&#8221; version of Dove. The Cool Moisture contains hints of green tea and cucumber. It costs a little more than plebian Dove, but aren&#8217;t you worth it? The scent is pleasant enough, light without being overpowering. The cucumber smell is the strongest. I am a regular green tea drinker, and I didn&#8217;t recognize that familiar aroma in this bath bar. But it&#8217;s nice. I like it.And that&#8217;s really all that matters. There is no discernable difference between this and regular Dove soap, so you just have to decide if the additional&#8212;and enjoyable&#8212;smell is worth the extra cost."], "Gamma": [0.21850083768367767, 0.2197129875421524, 0.2678932547569275, 0.2938929498195648], "Beta": [[0.08540608733892441, 0.09344274550676346, 0.07370848953723907, 0.08120738714933395, 0.08390449732542038, 0.0751451849937439, 0.0802207663655281, 0.07965558022260666, 0.08936968445777893, 0.08189505338668823, 0.08597583323717117, 0.09006871283054352], [0.08519633859395981, 0.09221044182777405, 0.07455684244632721, 0.08138274401426315, 0.08372357487678528, 0.0763506069779396, 0.08044062554836273, 0.07999762147665024, 0.08862154930830002, 0.08200521022081375, 0.08560952544212341, 0.08990483731031418], [0.08475308120250702, 0.09094558656215668, 0.07422654330730438, 0.08118800073862076, 0.08331040292978287, 0.07622979581356049, 0.08003311604261398, 0.07922385632991791, 0.08838623762130737, 0.08140084892511368, 0.08497070521116257, 0.09533187747001648], [0.08464112877845764, 0.09157651662826538, 0.07342406362295151, 0.08072294294834137, 0.08315891772508621, 0.07588403671979904, 0.07949993759393692, 0.07843664288520813, 0.0887598842382431, 0.08095499128103256, 0.08490752428770065, 0.09803340584039688]]}
