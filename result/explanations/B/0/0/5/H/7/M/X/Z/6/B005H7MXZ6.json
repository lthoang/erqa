All of the above combined with the tablet's often resetting its Wi-Fi connection resulting in sputtering performance while online are likely to contribute to a subpar, occasionally frustrating end-user experience. To place it all in some context, we currently use a XOOM, a Kindle Fire and an HP Touchpad, having previously owned a Galaxy Tab and having extensively tested an Acer Iconia A-500.Sadly, the Cruz is seriously behind times. Google has released Honeycomb as a tablet-specific OS but that may not be an option for this Cruz due to its one-core CPU and low memory. Yes, it can run Netflix and Pandora and most games and this is good and its face-facing camera makes video-chats possible. On the other hand, its lacking Bluetooth makes the tablet's own tiny speakers the only option for sound and pairing with a physical keyboard not a realistic option. Add to the above the poor, low-res display and the not always immediate response to finger or stylus input and you end up with a product that should not be on the market.I can't think of a good reason to purchase this Cruz considering the alternatives currently on the the market. The competition in the tablet marketplace is heating up and this is good for us, the intended users but it should also force the makers to come up with reasonably priced quality products.", "\"The Velocity Micro Cruz T410 has a lot going for it right out of the box.  After minimal set up, you're off and running with a variety of pre-installed apps.The screen is big, bright, and brilliant - pictures, games, and the web look great.  The touch screen is responsive without being overly sensitive.  The unit itself is light and thin - it's just a little bigger than your average eReader, at about the same weight.  The size and weight make it easy and comfortable to hold.The T410 comes with all of the standard Android \"\"ringtones\"\" for use as reminders and notifiers, which is great.  But I was more interested in how music and movies sounded.  It comes with an MP3 player - \"\"Music\"\" - and of course you can download WinAmp and many other programs for music.  Even through my old beat up headphones, the T410 didn't disappoint me.  Honestly, I liked the pre-loaded music app much better than WinAmp.  It was easier to use and it doesn't force you to use an SD card. I have not had a chance to test drive a movie, but of course you can stream movies from your Amazon account and Netflix (provided you have Wi-Fi, of course).I didn't expect the internet browser to be as good as it is.  You can choose whether to see the full version of your favorite website or the mobile version (a choice I appreciate).  You can zoom in and out with hand gestures (you've seen the \"\"pinching\"\" gestures in commercials I'm sure).  Sites load much quicker than I expected, even sites that are image heavy.I also didn't expect the device to come already equipped with a fully featured mobile office suite.  It comes with QuickOffice, which looks like it's going to be a great program.  It contains a word processor, spreadsheet program, presentation program, and .pdf reader.  This isn't a trial version either; it's the complete program, ready to use straight out of the box.The Kindle app is nice. You can see all of the covers in full color - that's something I appreciate.  I like the larger screen, as well, though it's not as easy on the eyes as an actual Kindle and you are going to have a lot of glare in bright light or out in the sun.  I was a bit disappointed that the app doesn't support the comics released alongside the Kindle Fire.  Other than that, I was pleased with how the app worked on the device.It's really surprising to me the wide variety of games that are available for the device.  The Amazon App Store has games for every taste, everything from simple word games to complex and very pretty RPGs. A lot of these games are free, by the way.My favorite thing is Live Wallpaper.  This is my first Android device, so I had no idea how cool this was.  The T410 comes with several animated wallpapers that can be set as a background, and a ton available for download (many for free). Yin the Black Cat and his dancing fireflies currently decorate my home screen (I scored the free version).I can now understand the draw of a tablet.  It's great for quick email checks, Facebooking, and Twitter, without having to wait for a laptop to start.  It's lighter and easier to cart around, making it great for trips, especially with apps like Netflix and Kindle to keep you entertained during a long flight or even on your morning commute to the office.Unfortunately, my list of cons to this tablet is much longer than my list of pros.To start, it's a weird size.  Finding a cover to protect it was a bit of a pain; even Velocity doesn't make one for the T410 at this point.  I found that some of the portfolios for existing products came close, but there was always an issue of the screen being obstructed or a fear of the tablet falling out the top.  There are a ton of nice sleeves on the market that will work, if you want to go that route.It also isn't as customizable as I'd like.  The menu screen is sorted a certain way, and there's no way to resort the icons or shuffle them around.  You can move the icons around on the homescreen, and shuffle apps back and forth between the menu and the home screen.  You can't hide apps you don't use, either.Which brings me to my next point: you cannot delete some of the pre-loaded apps you don't want. I have no use whatsoever for Angry Birds or Napster, yet I can't delete them and get them out of my way.I was disappointed to find that  many of the apps I went looking for aren't available.  I was unable to download The Weather Channel App, Google Sync, nor some magazine apps.  They're apparently not compatible with the table, and therefore not available in the Amazon App Store.  Android Market isn't available on this tablet either.  You have to purchase all of your apps through Amazon or not at all. The weirdest thing is the preloaded Facebook app.  Whenever I run it, a link in the app tells me it's out of date and I need to click to download an upgrade...but clicking it does nothing.  There's no Facebook app in the Amazon store, either.One of the apps I had hoped to get was Google Sync, since it allows me to sync all of my calendars across devices.  It simply isn't there. Not that I was able to use the calendar app - when I try to add an appointment, it tells me I have to set up my sync account, yet I can't find any option to do that.  The user manual wasn't any help in this area, either.And though I very much appreciate being able to switch between mobile and full website modes, some sites just won't work in full mode - like Google Plus.  Some websites are just toxic no matter what.  A Facebook game completely reset the tablet, causing me to have to re-download each and every Kindle book from my library that had been put on the device.My final gripe is battery life.  It simply isn't long enough.  Since there's no way to exit out of apps beyond a force shut down (which the tablet warns you not to do), the battery seems to drain really quickly.  During the weekend when I was trying out the device, I would have to stop and plug in at least once during the day. Turning off any widgets that use the internet (like facebook and Twitter) helps, but not much.I guess whether or not this tablet is for you is going to depend on how  you plan to use it.  For what it does, there are a lot of smaller, lighter devices out there that can do music, games, movies, and books all in one without weighing you down; many of which support more apps and have more accessories available.\"", "\"I can make this relatively short and sweet.First, the unit threatened to never power up in the first place. After repeated playing around with the power button, it did finally come on.The first thing I noticed is how slow it is to boot. The iPad is essentially instant on. The Fire doesn't take long. After you turn this on, go make a cup of coffee. It's not really much different than waiting on Windows to boot on your PC. Very unimpressive.Documentation is virtually non-existent. It is a tiny pamphlet which doesn't even explain the software device to move from the boot-done screen to the \"\"I can use this now\"\" screen.The browser is the slowest I've ever seen. Really terrible page response.As an app example: I downloaded Angry Birds Season, and started playing season 11. Halfway through the second screen the app disappeared and I was back to the home screen. The app didn't appear in my games list. I had to return to the Amazon app store and REINSTALL it. This was 5 minutes after I installed it in the first place. The second time through I got to the 4th screen, which promptly locked up as I was attempting to launch the last bird. It took a power reset to recover from this.Battery life appears to be short lived. My grand-daughter played Angry Birds Rio on it for an hour on Thanksgiving afternoon, and the battery was down 40%. That's bad.On board memory is pretty low. I'm not a big iPad fan and I'd spend the extra money on an iPad rather than suffer through this just to save a bit of cash. I don't see how anyone could be satisfied with this unit in the long run. I'll keep trying it for a while to see if anything improves my opinion, but it would take some turnaround in my experience with this device for that to happen.\"", "If this was a year ago, the Velocity Micro Cruz Tablet T410 would be considered a middle of the road tablet, at a decent price. Going into 2012, with a price tag of almost $300, there is just no way to recommend the Velocity Micro Cruz Tablet T410 at any price. Quad core tablets, with 32 or 64GB of internal storage, and running the latest Honeycomb or Ice Cream Sandwich operating systems are coming out this month. Do you really want to spend $300 on a tablet with a slow single core processor, only 4G of internal storage, and running old Android 2.3? For little more, you can buy a dual-core Tegra 2 Tablet right now, with 16GB of storage, and running Anroid 3.x. The Velocity Micro Cruz Tablet T410 also does not include Google's Android Market. It does have the Amazon App Store though. Adding to the disappointment are the T410's mediocre screen, and poor battery life. The screen is not nearly as bright as the other tablets I own, and has a limited viewing angle. The battery lasted less than 6 hours on a full charge. All in all, the Velocity Micro Cruz Tablet T410 just isn't very good in any area. It lacks features, and is obsolete right out of the box. Look elsewhere.Pros:SD card storage.Seems well built.Cons:Older Android 2.3 O/S.Slow single-core Cortex A8 processor.4GB internal storage.Mediocre screen.Poor battery life.No Android Market.Overpriced.Edit 12/25/2011Having had the T410 for some time now, I've upgraded my rating slightly for a couple of reasons. The price has come down $30. Also, even though the hardware is still minimal, and the O/S hasn't been updated past Android 2.3, the tablet does perform fairly well even with these limitations. I still can't recommend it though, since for $30 more, you can buy a dual core tablet running Andoid 3.x (Honeycomb). If the price drops down close to the $200 mark, then this tablet would be player in the low cost tablet market.", "\"UPDATE on 12-23-2011: The Cruz T410's touchscreen became increaseingly difficult to use after the honeymoon period was over, and it's now a royal pain in the butt to use! The screen itself is just too dark, even at the highest brightness setting. I did some research and found that this is just a rebranded Samsung tablet. I have no experience with that brand but at my local Costco store the cell phone lady said stay away from their phones because their touchscreens never worked really well. Anyway, we now rarely use the T410 and will look for a replacement! I lowered the rating to 2 stars - maybe some people will stil find this cheap tablet ok for their purposes. Happy holidays!![original review:] Velocity Micro is a specialty PC maker. It also makes a few Android tablets; the Cruz T410 can be considered their \"\"flagship\"\" Android tablet model [update: but it's just a rebranded model from Samgung so it's not OEM.]. It has an elongated shape; indeed, its physical dimensions are 10.75 x 6.75 x 0.4 inches. The 10-inch (measured diagonally) LCD screen has 1024x600 resolution -- the same as the B&N; nook tablet and the Amazon Kindle Fire, although those two have smaller screens.  Velocity Micro advertises the screen as a 16:9 screen, although its true aspect ratio is 1024/600=1.71, vs. the 16/9 aspect ratio of 1.78.The T410 feels solid in the hands, and not too heavy.  It weighs 1 pound, but because it feels long in the landscape orientation, you need to hold it in both hands, in which case it does not feel heavy.  It definitely feels lighter than my Vizio Tablet with an 8-inch screen.  The build seems pretty high-quality, with a rubber-feel back that makes the T410 unlikely to slip out of your hands.  In the portrait mode, it does look and feel a little weird, because it's really long!The T410 is packaged in an attractive box which is really way too big for a slim device!  But it was completely frustration-free and very easy to open and unpack.  Included are a mini-USB cable, a one-piece wall AC adapter, and a 44-page printed \"\"official user's guide.\"\" (No other documentation is available on Velocity Micro's website or on the tablet itself.) The user's guide incorrectly refers to the USB port as \"\"micro-USB,\"\" whereas in fact it's mini-USB.One nice touch, probably not intentional but I don't know..., is the T410 has a protective film covering the screen, the type you usually see on LCD-equipped gadgets like this.  The nice thing is this film is transparent and works well as a screen protector!  I imagine it'll be hard to find a custom-size screen protector for this, so I'll just leave the factory-applied protection on.  It probably does not stick very well, but with care I think it'll stay on for a while.Speaking of the screen... it's a capacitive touch type. Unfortunately, it's not too bright. Even at the highest setting, it does not strike you as very bright. In fact, its highest brightness is about the 30% brightness of my Archos 48 with a 4.8-inch screen. (I do not recommend the Archos at all.)  Outdoors the screen is hard to see, whereas the Archos' screen as well as that of myHTC Radar 4G Windows Phone (T-Mobile)are easy to see even under direct sunlight, at the highest setting.The T410 has a single-core Cortex A8 processor running at 1Ghz. Speedwise it feels somewhat snappier than my Vizio Tablet, which has a slower processor but also runs Android 2.3.  There is 512MB of RAM, and the built-in storage is 4GB of SSD, but only 2.5GB is user-accessible.  The other 1.5GB is used by the Android 2.3 OS.  There is, however, a microSD card slot on the left side, and microSD cards up to 32GB are supposedly supported.  I don't have a spare microSD lying around so I haven't tested using a microSD card yet.  It's always nice to have extended storage, even if such storage is quite a bit slower than built-in flash storage.The T410 has 802.11 b/g/n wi-fi; its range seems mediocre, about the same as my nookcolor and Vizio, much better than the Archos 48, but not as good as my HTC Radar or also somewhat worse than my iPod touch 4th-gen. There's a front-facing VGA webcam, and you can use Skype with that. In the sensor department, the T410 has an accelerometer.  Screen auto-orientation is not as snappy as my HTC Radar or iPod touch but more responsive than the Vizio or nookcolor.In terms of adding apps, you're officially restricted to just the Amazon Appstore for Android, which has about 10,000 apps according to my research.  There's another web-based app market called GetJar but I had trouble using it, and its app quality seemed much worse.  Unfortunately there is no easy access to the Android Market at large.  This may not be as bad as it seems because the Amazon Appstore has better-quality Android apps than those in the Android Market.The T410 comes with a bunch of crapware such as Angry Birds, Soduku, Amazon Kindle, QuickOffice, Napster, etc.  This is crapware because you *cannot* uninstall any of these!  I'll never play Angry Birds or use Napster, for instance, so I'd have preferred to delete them, but no I can't do that.  Kind of disappointing!The interface is the generic Android 2.3 widget board kind, which is quite clunky and a pain to use, especially for nontechies like me.  (The same interface is on Android 3.x, but way more complicated.)  There's the home screen with five sub-screens and then there is the separate app screen.  Very annoying!I've installed about 20 apps from my collection of Amazon Appstore apps.  They all run fine, no force closes so far (knock on wood).  But when you have more than 3 or 4 apps open at the same time the system does slow down.  The stock browser is clunky and slow and doing anything requires multiple taps here and there.  Also, already, I needed to shut off and restart to make the T410 responsive again.  Very typical of my Android experience from ver. 1.x to 3.x!The widescreen screen and microSD expansion make this a decent video player, but I think the low screen brightness will limit my use of this tablet to inside the house only.  In spite of the severe limitations of Android, I give this tablet 4 stars because it feels well-built, not something that would embarass you in front of you girlfriends, and it feels not heavy in the hands.\"", "\"Ironically, I bought the Kindle Fire and this Cruz tablet arrived at the same time.First and foremost, Velocity Micro customer service is the worst.  I purposely planted several support tickets on their web site to see how they would be addressed, and I am very turned off by the company's response. Details to follow.So far, extremely disliking this unit. I bought a 32GB microSDHC for this thing. It works, it reads it, it can store content, but it does not eject. There is no way that I can see to remove it. I understand the \"\"click\"\", and I understand it should pop out when depressed. I told them all this, and also asked them not tell me I put it in wrong, as I just said the card works and can be used. So, how do I get the microSDHC out? At this point the card is more valuable to me. I went into great detail about the issue, and their FULL response to me (three days later) was:\"\"Using the tip of an ink pen or a paper clip, press the microSD card in until it clicks and it should spring eject at that point. Regards\"\"So, the microSDHC card is stuck, and they want me to jam a pen in there?  Clearly the \"\"spring eject\"\" is faulty. But the card is being read and usable.  I just can't get it out.Another support question was the inability to stream video.  For instance, on the Kindle Fire, you can stream any of the Instant Video library.  With the Cruz, you can't stream anything.  I used that as one example for them, and their reply (three days later) was:\"\"You will need to ask Amazon to correct the issue. Regards.\"\"So, it's Amazon's fault that streaming video does not work?And let's talk about the apps... you have the Amazon app store, or Android market (same thing), and I would say about 50% are not compatible with the Cruz.  Kindle, I cannot think of one app that was incompatible.  I have been going crazy downloading a ton of cool apps during Amazon's 10 cent sales and free app of the day deals.  And if they do install on the Cruz, it's a crap-shoot to see if it works or does not freeze up.Another annoying app situation is being forced to keep things I will never use like Napster or ESPN etc. If I don't want to see it, I want to make it go away, and I cannot.Booting up is slow, and half the time, I don't even know if it's starting or know what it's doing. Finally a white screen will appear at some point, flash, and reappear, and just sit on the white screen sometimes for several minutes.  As opposed to the Kindle Fire, that just starts running immediately, and is fast.There are some touch issues around the interior half inch of the sides of the screen.  I find myself forcing and repeat clicking menu items on top and bottom because it does not pick up the touch.  Not impressed.  You get used to it, and can call it user error, if you wish, but it's should be easy right off the bat.Camera. Yes. Worthless.You can go through the chore of organizing apps in bookmarked screens, but it likes to wipe out 70-90% of what you saved before shutting it down.  So you start up with random app icons in sporadic places.  Who has time for this app crap?Lastly, there are zero accessories for this tablet.  Yet another email to Velocity asking for suggestions about a case, and they gave me a link to buy a 4gb microSDHC (WT?).  It's not an iPad, or a Kindle, and it fits nothing correctly.  I have bought two different cases so far, and settling on one made by Victorinox. Nice case, and not made for the T410, so, it does not really fit.  The power cord does not help as the plug is not collapsible, bulky, and needs to be carried separately.  This unit does not even include a simple neoprene sleeve.But, with all that negativity aside, if the list price was a hundred bucks cheaper, it would be acceptable and useable. But for the reduced price and size, I am loving the Kindle Fire in every way compared to this thing. So even if it were the same price as the Kindle Fire, I would choose the Kindle.UPDATE 01/03/12: I'm actually here to take off another star. This this is just so annoying, time consuming and I am completely turned off by the company. I still have a 32GB microSDHC stuck in the thing. Problem with this thing is that customization and layout disappears as soon as you power it off.  It's a visually cosmetic and organizational issue, however, the process of trying to make a layout of apps on the screen is time consuming. You have the main screen you see in the photo, with the search bar and app icons under it.  If you turn the page to it's left, you have live apps that you can choose to keep running. I have things like Twitter and Facebook going for ease of checking updates on important stuff like a friend's status announcing their kid throwing up in the grocery store, or a Tweet from a friend who thought they saw Steve Buscemi, but it was actually a tree trunk... you know... urgent stuff.  That seems to work okay.  (Thank God!) But turning the page to the right of the main screen gives you a couple more pages to fill with apps.  I have many apps, and certainly need organization, so this sounds like a very appealing thing. I put the apps I use the most on the main page. I then make the next page business, news and important apps... the next, games and stupid apps, and the next, creative, art and publishing type apps... well, I have set this up several times.  Saved everything.  However, upon starting up again, about 90% of all the apps placed are just GONE.  They are still installed, and can be accessed in the main \"\"all apps\"\" area, but organization, just ruined. I turn the pages, see a couple of apps in their places, surrounded by empty spots of all the other apps I put there.  I have tried so many scenarios as to why this is happening. (of course support is useless, and clearly outsourced, so you are on your own).  One thought was that maybe the missing apps in the empty spots are the ones on the card, and the others on the device itself... not the case.  Keep in mind, I have tried to customize the app layout many times.  In one case, after spending the mind-numbing time of placement and \"\"bookmark\"\" type layouts of all the apps on their various pages, I actually opened and used every single app, thinking that activating the app from where it was bookmarked, that it would stay there.  Hours later. No.  So, I completely give up trying to customize it.  I put a few apps on the one main page.  If they stay there, great.  Otherwise, I am stuck digging through the sea of \"\"all apps\"\" at once.Another issue with apps is that it's a crap shoot finding an app compatible with the Cruz T410.  If you register the unit, or any Android device with Amazon, the page will tell you if it is compatible with your device. amzn.to/FireApps The page shows bestsellers and free app of the day etc.  Well, not many are compatible with the Cruz. Amazon app store app is essentially the same as Android Market (but easier to use), and with either source, it's hard to get what you want.  i.e. if you want to play Scrabble on your Cruz, it's not gonna happen.  On the Kindle Fire, however, you can do most anything.  The Kindle is so much faster.  The Cruz feels bugged, slow, and freezes often. Although 3\"\" bigger than the Kindle, I am using the Kindle Fire every day (also, it has never frozen, with twice as many apps, and no card needed).  The Cruz, not seeing the point of it anymore. It still does not stream video either. You can do YouTube, but not Amazon Instant Video or stream Prime movies etc.Lastly, I have also given up trying to protect the device.  It's dimensions do not fit any case or sleeve correctly at 10.5 x 6.5 inches, I am still using the Victorinox case as mentioned before, and it's \"\"protected\"\", but it's a sleeve, and it's flopping around in there as the unit is narrower. Battery does not last as long as Kindle Fire either, and the Cruz cord is just a bulky PITA that needs it's own case. There ARE listings on Amazon if you search something like \"\"Cruz T410 case\"\", but they are not made for it, these are third party sellers that are just using the keywords as it will fit in it, but not made for it. That's why I am stuck with two cases that are essentially Netbook sleeves. Enough on this.  It's fine for the guest room nightstand for people who visit or something.UPDATE 08/02/12:  This thing has been rendered useless and I came back on this page just to see if anyone else fell victim, and I see many. Sad to see everyone going through this when I was so detailed. Removing the last star for the last straw.  Good luck!\"", "\"UPDATE on 1-7-2012: My parents just started using this tablet.  They love it.  I helped them get their e-mail accounts set up (I downloaded the free app, K-9 Mail, which seems more feature-rich than the default mail app, especially when it comes to bulk deleting of spam).  They surfed the web, watched Law and Order on Netflix, played Angry Birds Rio, found a YouTube video they've been wanting to show me, and checked the weather.  It's opened up a whole new world for them!  Even though I look at it side-by-side with my iPad 2 and can see the shortcomings of the Cruz, this low-cost tablet perfectly meets their needs (with one possible exception...my dad is wondering how he can easily transfer pictures from his camera to the tablet...haven't figured out the best solution yet for that).  But I'm SO happy they are using it.  My original review follows...Putting this tablet in a challenge against an iPad 2 or the Samsung Galaxy Tab is pointless.  The typically-top-rated tablets have better screen resolution, better cameras, more memory, and faster processors.  But the better tablets also cost quite a bit more than this entry from Velocity.  The latest tablet comparisons in PC World magazine put all of the top tablets around the $400-$500 range.For a below $300 tablet, this seems to me to be a perfectly acceptable purchase.  Surf the web, check e-mail, listen to music, watch videos...this will do the trick.  As I look at the screen quality on this, I realize immediately that it can't compare with the iPad 2.  But I also know that there are many people out there who couldn't care less about such differences.So, consider this.  For under $300, you get:1) A perfectly capable web browser...one that can handle flash websites.  It's not a particularly peppy browser, but it is responsive enough (as is its Android operating system) to not be frustrating.2) An e-mail application that can handle the typical e-mail account, INCLUDING Exchange e-mail.  Exchange is important to me, as my employer uses Exchange for e-mail, scheduling, and address book functionality.3) Decent enough sound and video quality.  Play your own videos or music, or stream something with the Pandora or Netflix apps.  (By comparison, I found that the Netflix app on the Kindle Fire is not acceptable, because the video and audio are out of sync.)4) Decent selection of downloadable apps.  I've played around with Angry Birds, a painting app, board games, facebook, Amazon's Kindle app, Words with Friends, the TuneIn Radio app, and more.  They've all worked well...no complaints.  I should point out, though, that not all Android apps will work on this device, however.  For example, even though I have been able to install apps via Amazon's Appstore and the Android Market, I have had no luck installing Google Docs and some other apps.If price is important, you could consider the $199 Kindle Fire, but that's much more a media \"\"consuming\"\" device...geared more toward reading/watching/listening, than toward day-to-day business.  Or, you could spend $500 for a Galaxy Tab 10.1 or iPad 2.  But if your price point is \"\"around $300\"\", then this Velocity MIcro Cruz is worth considering.  It does a pretty decent job.\"", "UPDATE:Well after about 1 week of use. My feeling about this tablet have chg's. Battery life is fairly short.. a big downer if you aren't going to be near a plug in site..The issue for me about this  tablet is the Less than positive SCREEN resolution. I just can't get use to the slightly fuzzy screen. It is slightly better when watching a movie with lots of colors and movement but just looking at it i.e. for emails, or reading a news site it is definitely less than OPTIMUM..It still is pretty fast.. surprisingly so.. No lag in switching sites  or screens.. Downloads are good. Typing isnt' hard but I am use to touchscreens and never ever got use to using just my THUMBS .. so keep that in mind. I did try this attached to a external mini keyboard but it will not work.Overall.. my assessment is that at this price point I expected better screen resolution and much better battery life.. If these aren't improved I feel this tablet will struggle against others in this price area.  For these reasons I am dropping my review by one STAR..Sorry I was very excited about  this tablet.. but not so  much after using it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was anxious to get my hands on this tablet to give it a real spin around the block.This unit comes nicely packaged with the necessities of a charger, USB  cable and a very small instruction manualThe unit came almost fully charged which was a real surprise..  There are only  3 very small buttons on the top of the unit  I can see that because they are close together they could easily be hitting one when you intend to hit another..  The charging port and the  location for the Micro SD slot are on the lower side of the unit.  This unit isn't as heavy as I expected.. But will be a little awkward to use as a ereader..Start up wasn't bad.. I has to load some of the operating instructions so be PATIENT... It takes a while and then the BLACK screen.. For about 45 sec to 1 minutes.. Then startupIt is preloaded with a number of apps, one live Background.then  the usual walk through to  get started but where I got stuck was trying to connect to my own WIFI... This took more than several tries.. No reason I can see for it but it did.. Finally established a guest access but my walled access was denied. Will deal with that later...Now onto the Screen. This is where I was slightly taken aback.. I thought my glasses were dirty or something but the screen resolution is , how can I say this without sounding totally negative , better viewed from a arms length away.. Close up shows the  less than stellar resolution.Now onto the apps..  First you need to understand that  the  primary option for apps on this unit is through the Amazon app market NOT the Google market..  you can side load the Google apps but that takes little manipulation to get it on there.. But for most people that are getting this unit more than enough apps to make you pretty happy using Amazon but For veterans android users , not so much.The processor is pretty snappy.. I was truly surprised at the quick chg's and  searchs where FAST.Then I tried Pandora and Tunein.. Radio stations.. Again pretty snappy but the sound is low and no adjustments make a lot of difference.  Best used with a ear buds or head set.Then I downloaded Netflix and again similar snappy function.  Smooth motion of the  movies... WASN'T bad would keep me entertained on a long tripSo  after a short use of the unit.. These are my observations  I will add additional review details after longer use*****.  I will report later on BaTTERY LIFE  but that takes several days to test out .. So Stay Tuned.ProThis is a 10 inch tablet with a pretty darn snappy  processor..Ability to add storage space up to 32 g. is a real POSITIVE feature.Access to the Amazon app store is easy and efficient and gives you some of the better apps out thereSmooth view  of videos .. This is a real plus for many who plan to use this as an portable entertainment unitFront facing camera  for access to video conferencing or Skype calling using wifi free service.No problems surfing or playing music or watching movies or video.Easy start upLight weightAngry Birds worked WELLKindle app readily available to start enjoying all the good ebooks out there.Cons;Lack of easy access to the Google marketLess than stellar screen resolutionSome awkward placements of buttons both physical and virtual ( at the top of the screen vs the more common location on the bottom )Minimal instruction for the novice userPrice point is a little higher than similar or in some case superior tablets in this size But this should drop over the holiday season.Low sound volumeIn conclusion:This is what it is ... A moderate priced 10 inch android tablet that will satisfy most users .I real pleasant ENTERTAINMENT toolEnough apps to keep you happy and busy, Ease of surfing and watching movies is a real PLUS.Understanding that this is the economy model vs the Killer tablet  and for most of us that will make us very happy for several years to come."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.0004810297104995698, 0.010149508714675903, 0.21934111416339874, 0.1417519897222519, 0.21564537286758423, 0.028861260041594505, 0.38186055421829224, 0.0019091725116595626]]}
