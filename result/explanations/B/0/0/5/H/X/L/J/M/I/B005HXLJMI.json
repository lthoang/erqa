This is really intuitive though. Rather than be forced to either go through the labor intensive process of installing ceiling speakers or have any extra speakers at all to clutter up your room, this genius idea installs speakers in any room you want and maintains use as a light as well. We've been playing music from our ipod Touch all day while patching drywall holes in our new home. The music is sufficiently loud for a quiet home or office, but don't plan on using it for a large party. The only complaint is that the light itself is not very bright, the equivalent of a 60 watt. I also wonder how long the lightbulb will last and what it will take to replace it, as this main unit is the only one currently on the market, with replacement yet to be available.4.5 stars, and well worth the savings. Highly recommended.", "For the price that is being asked for this system there are some key features that need to be present. A standard audio out is foremost among them. It may seem counterintuitive for a wireless speaker system to also have a wired connection but its a simple matter of physics that you often need to have a separate subwoofer if you want good bass response or if the enclosures are vibration-prone and need the bass turned down. The sound quality on these speakers is pretty good although not outstanding. The setup was easy and the technology is sound.  Unfortunately, the reliance soley on the wireless tech is what makes this product a gimmick rather than a winner.  If it just had a sub and/or audio output so it could be integrated properly then it would be far more usable and worth much closer to whats being charged for it.", "\"This is probably one of the most ill-conceived, kind of good idea things I've ever seen.It seems a compelling proposition... a LED, energy saving lightbulb, that contains a wireless speaker. How cool is that? Well it's cool until you figure out that the speaker in most cases is either going to be pointing straight up to the ceiling, or straight down to the floor. So right off the bat you've got some issues with optimal sound dispersion. Then you've got to consider that the fixture the light/speaker will be in likely has a shade around it, further causing difficulty for sound dispersion. Then consider that the unique shape of the unit makes it not suitable for most fixtures (at least in my house) and that the kit only includes hardware for attaching a lampshade to a single lamp, not two. Why only provide one lampshade bracket when there are two speakers? Go figure.We have numerous recessed light fixtures in our house. Great, or so I thought. It turns out that you can't really use these in dimmer controlled fixtures unless you make sure the dimmer is full on. Well, that's not going to happen most of the time in our house so I can't use them in the recessed fixtures. Also some of our fixtures are just too small in diameter for the unit to fit in. Another fail.The transmitter/base is just something you've got to find space somewhere to put. If you are used to using a docking iPod speaker, then you've probably got the space. But otherwise it might actually be challenging to find an appropriate spot to put this where it's easy to get to when you need to undock your iPod.I did not find it particularly easy to set up although it was not impossibly difficult.I just think that this was someone's brilliant idea but in reality it's not really working for me.I will give the LED lights a big thumbs up though. This is my first experience using an LED household light and I found the color of the emitted light quite pleasant. The dimming feature was nice too. But you must know that even 30,000 hours of potential life means that someday the LED\"\"s will dim and die and then you've got a speaker only... the LED's can't be replaced according to the company.I could not really recommend it for most people, but if you have the right fixtures, in the right kind of room and don't need superb sound and don't mind the possibility that someday the LED's will burn out (30,000 hours but who really knows?) you might get some usability out of this.UPDATE: 10/22/2011 - I want to make a further observation about the LED light aspect of these GiiNii fixtures. You have to realize that the LED\"\"s are a circle of LED's around the top edge of the fixture. What the implications of this are is that when the bulb is in a standard lamp with lampshade, that the entire bottom section of the lampshade will be in relative darkness since no light is going to be shining through the lampshade due to the fact that the LED\"\"s are going to be pointing straight up through the top of the lamp, not to the sides. It looks really weird to see these in a typical lamp. I think the ideal situation would be to have these in recessed fixtures, but again, the issue is many recessed fixtures are going to either be controlled by a dimmer or may not be large enough diameter for the GiiNii's to fit in. Or, if you do put the GiiNii into a recessed floodlight fixture, then you're going to have a lot of empty space around the bulb itself which looks odd. These are not like a CFL bulb or standard light bulb in the manner in which they emit light.UPDATE: 10/28/2011 -  Another annoyance of this system is the extremely bright light that flashes on the base station. Best advice is to cover it with a piece of black tape.My thoughts on these haven't changed. I'm about to remove them from my house as they just don't really provide adequate light or decent enough sound. For the same cost as this system you can purchase a Bluetooth Wireless Speaker System such as theAltec Lansing iMW725 inMotion Air Universal Wireless Speakeror perhpas theBose SoundLink Wireless Mobile Speaker - Nylonboth of which not only offer better sound, but are able to run from internal battery power and are easily transportable so their use is not limited to one room. Way more practical in my opinion.\"", "The wireless light bulb music system required little effort to install. Plug the AC adapter into the docking station, plug it in the wall and connect a device - I used an iPod. The docking station comes with adapters for different versions of iPhones so a tight fit can be accomplished. My iPod fit without an adapter.Other devices can be connected with the included mini-phone plug so it can be used with almost any MP3 player, portable radio, PC - essentially anything with a headphone jack. The docking station transmits from 50-100 feet away depending upon the situation. The included remote has a battery installed and it's ready to go.The biggest decision is where to place the speaker/light. They cannot be used in areas with moisture, or an enclosed can light (the ones with a cover - sealed cans.) Although they work in lamps (included are extra large harps that fit the speaker/bulbs) that idea didn't appeal to me, so I decided to put them in a little exercise alcove - not quite a full-size room. It measures eight and a half feet by ten and a half. It is the perfect size for a couple of pieces of work-out equipment but little else. Floor space is at a premium, so it is helpful that there are two light sconces on opposite walls that would hold the bulbs/speakers and give the room not only light, but sound. The docking unit is placed in the room next to the alcove.The entire installation took perhaps five minutes. I replaced the light bulbs in the sconces with the speaker/bulbs, turned on the docking station, inserted the iPod and hit play. The sound is amazingly good considering the size of the speakers - it was a wow moment. No wires running from the speakers to the docking station, no additional installation beyond that of installing a light bulb.The LED light is bright, but it is important to note that light just comes out of the top of the bulb, which may present an aesthetic problem because the entire light fixture won't be illuminated. Additionally, the bulbs are quite large so that may be a factor, too. Most standard glass sconce shades will be too short and could be too narrow in diameter to hold the speaker/bulb. And, if installed in can lights, keep in mind if consistency is a concern, they will not match any can lights in the vicinity both in appearance and type of light. Also, it is important that the installation provide room for air to circulate around the speaker/bulb.The light fixture should not be on a dimmer switch but if it is it should be left on the highest setting. My lights are on a dimmer and the performance was unaffected. The docking station has volume control, a bass button for extra oomph, mute button, start/pause, source (if more than one device is plugged in) and light brightness controls.  The remote control buttons mirror the docking station.Two separate zones can be established and up to eight speaker/bulbs installed, but for my purposes, the basic two unit set-up is perfect.  The wireless light bulb speaker system exceeded my expectations in both sound quality and convenience. It is easy to use, fills a need and I would recommend the set to everyone.", "When it has came down to the Apple Ipod, it has been one of the most definitive music players on the market. It is hard to believe that it is celebrating its 10th anniversary. Yet, there are so many speaker systems that work well with the Ipod and other MP3 players, yet they can have some bugs in them. This one isn't one of them. GiiNii's Autobulb Wireless music system works great with just about any MP3 Player or your Ipod, and can play all your favorite songs in really rich sound. While I do honestly wish though it could've been a little bit cheaper in its price, but you do get your dollars' worth. If you're looking for a way to play your tunes really loud, than give Giinii's Autobulb music system a try.Price: CSound: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2-", "With the popularity of iPods and MP3 players, super expensive home sound systems, including expensive turntables, speakers, and subwoofers, have become a thing of the past. Today, we can literally carry our entire music collection in our hands, but we're carrying compressed files, so quality iPod docks and speakers are important if you desire and appreciate good sound.The AudioBulb, by GiiNii, provides a unique solution: a wireless music and lighting system that you can play in any room in your home, including, if you have a light socket, outside in your front or backyard. The AudioBulb is super-easy to set up, I literally had the system up and running in about one minute. And the speakers sound great; I tried a variety of music, including jazz, rock 'n' roll, classical, and R&B;, and the speakers produced a very clear sound. I even turned up the volume, and the speakers handled the bass and treble very well, with no distortion. I tried the speakers inside my home and they easily filled a moderate and even a large-sized room. I also tried these in my backyard and again the speakers performed well, offering great sound without the hassles of running wires or drilling holes through walls. The signal also didn't drop, even after I moved the base station out of the room and away from the speakers.Now the downside. The light that the AudioBulbs produce is not all that great. Even at its brightest (there are four stages of brightness) the bulbs did not seem to produce that much light. The bulbs are also much heavier than a standard light bulb, so if your light source is a small lamp, be careful while screwing in the bulb to ensure it doesn't tip over your lamp. Also, don't drop the bulb. I don't get the impression they would survive a fall on a hard surface, such as a tile floor.But these are small quibbles. I love the fact that I can use these anywhere in my home, and even in numerous rooms and outdoors (as long as the light source is protected from rain). Even better is the fact that I can enjoy great sound, and some light, without running wires through walls. Highly recommended, especially if you want a simple-to-use wireless system in your home that produces great sounding music.", "Overall:  A pricey and complex device that, while intriguing, probably isn't the solution to your audio needs.  While combining the speakers into the LED bulb provides constant power to your wireless speakers, bear in mind that you're permanently linking the audio functions to the lighting functions.  If you flip a wall switch that controls your light fixture, you've just severed power to the speaker.  Flip the switch again and the connection is restored and the light and audio return full power.  If you want to control the two separately you have to remember to do so from the base unit.Setup:  Setup is relatively simple out of the box and the included directions are reasonably clear and concise.  Know in advance that the audiobulbs are quite large, and that they may have trouble fitting into smaller light fixtures.  The base station is compact, but made of cheaper plastics than you'd expect at this price point.Sound:  The sound quality is quite good and a high-point for the system, provided that the audiobulbs are not mounted in a light fixture that obscures their sound projection.  They provide good sound range at all reasonable volume levels.  Sound quality seems to be best when the audiobulbs are mounted in overhead recessed or track lighting.Lighting:  The LED bulbs provide light in reasonable quantity and better color temperature than most CFL bulbs I've seen.  However, note that since the LEDs project the light in a relatively narrow beam, that if used in a traditional lamp with lampshade, the included bounce panel must be used (if it fits!).  As with the sound, lighting seems to work best from either recessed or track overhead lights.  Note that it may be annoying to conjoin the audio function with the light function, and that if you use a wall switch to turn off the device that the LEDs will come on at full brightness when turned back on.Recommended uses:  This product could make great sense if you have a small business or restaurant that would like to economically install an iPod-controlled speaker system into an existing space.  Otherwise, given the relative high price, think carefully to make sure it meets your needs.", "\"I received this product more than a little excited; I had installed an intercom in my home when we built it over 15 years ago, and while I enjoyed it, FM radio and cassette are hardly my preferred medium for listening to music in 2011.  Unfortunately, the cost of retrofitting a more modern internet/streaming/music player was prohibitive and so the intercom has sat unused for over a decade and no way to play music around the house.Enter Audiobulb.  This product replaces any light bulb with a combination LED light ring and speaker for up to 8 speakers located throughout your house.  In the box, you get two \"\"lights\"\", and a base that lets you connect any ipod directly to play music directly to the speakers.  The idea is very cool, but I was curious how well it would work.Installing the speakers/lights are easy.  You unscrew a bulb and screw these bulbs in its place.  You turn the light switch on, and then connect the base station.  From that point, you control both the music and brightness of the lights from the base station.  I used a iPod touch (you could use any iPod, including the iPhone), using streaming music from any app on your ipod/iphone or just plain music.  It worked right out of the box.  Seriously couldn't be simpler, just turn on the base station, insert your ipod, use the supplied remote control, and play music.First thing is the sound.  The sound is good.  Certainly better than my intercom, better than a table radio, but not as good as a dedicated stereo. Considering the size of the speakers, I considered the sound to be much better than expected.The light?  Well, the light works well enough, although I wish it was a bit brighter on high.  Although the specs say these are LED lights, they look a lot more like CFL's when turned on.  I replace existing CFL's, so it was not a big deal, but they don't have the typical look of LED's.Operationally, the controls are fairly seamless and the entire package feels well thought-out.  Volume and lights as well as music can be controlled via the base station or remote.  The base station has blue LCD's which are bright.  I would have preferred a more subdued color (green/red), but its a quibble.Also included is a light harp for use in table lamps and a reflector (which I suspect is used with the same harp, although the directions are a little unclear on this point).  I didn't try this configuration.Some other interesting touches:  this will control 2 sets of 2 speakers.  It appears you can have each of these speakers as a mono speakers (8 separate speakers) or 4 sets of stereo speakers, with the ability to control each zone individually.Using these for two weeks, I found that very occasionally, I would get a slight dip in sound, I don't know if this was caused by some radio interference.  It probably didn't happen more than 5 times for about a second.  Also, if your lights are controlled by a light switch, you MUST leave the light switch on or neither the lights or speakers will work (the speakers get their power from the light socket).  If you flip the light off, a blue light on the base will flash letting you know its lost contact with the speakers.  Finally, this product is clearly designed to work with an iPod, but if you don't have one, the GiiNii supplies a cable letting you attach any device to the base station, although you lose the ability to control the device by remote.  Nice touch.The only thing missing is a bluetooth connection to avoid the physical dock on the device for iPod Touch, iPad, and iPhone, but perhaps GiiNii is saving that for the next version.So my verdict?  Very nice, very elegant, very well engineered.  If you have need of hidden speakers that will let you play music, this would fit very discreetly into any home.Pros:Speaker/Light combination is very appealing on many levelsNicely integrated with iPodGiiNii engineers didn't leave any rough edges on this oneInstallation is trivialWill control up to 4 speakers around your homeDoes not depend on power line to transmit soundCon:Light could be brighterNOTE:  I took some pictures of the installation, but until the AudioBulb is released, it appears I can't upload the pictures.  I will upload them as soon as I'm able.Update 12/17I still use this and enjoy it, however, one of the lights has begun to flicker from time to time, and the volume continues to have sudden drops from time to time.  I'm going to assume I've gotten a bad sample.\"", "This thing is (simply put) awesome.Positive Aspects:* The speakers have a light built into them so you do not lose your lamps light giving abilities.* The speakers sounded reasonable given the limitations of the system.* The dock also charges the iPod/iPhone.* Setup was super easy--2 mins.* The Bulbs fit in my ceiling fan which I was a pleasant surprise.* Has an audio input for use with other devices.Some things to consider:* Base station has a bright blue light which blinks when the speakers aren't on. It's annoying.* The light these give off has a very odd spectrum. People look jaundiced under them."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.009937074035406113, 0.0044637881219387054, 0.030029166489839554, 0.0019568447023630142, 0.003013962646946311, 0.00257790251635015, 0.012892365455627441, 0.7838460206985474, 0.15128293633460999]]}
