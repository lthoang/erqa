"], "reviews": ["I like most things about this K-cup...  It is easy to clean, load, and use. Only think I would change is I wish it was easier to clean out.  Overall,, recommended.", "First off, I want to say that I've used both theKeurig My K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filterand theSolofill Cup, Refillable K-Cup For Keurig Brewers ,Two Packfor as long as they've been available to me. The My KCup came with my Keurig and while it worked well enough, it is a pain to clean, and moreso it's a pain to use because you have to remove a part from your Keurig to use it.  I bought the SoloFill to fix those issues and I was happy enough with it.After reading the reviews of the Eco Brew I thought I'd give it a try. It seemed like it would cure the one ill  had with the Solofill - it can be a pain to clean, because of that little piece at the bottom that drops down. Having read other reviews on the Eco Brew I thought this sounded like the perfect solution.I've used the Eco Brew about 4 times now and so far I have to agree more with the negative reviews than the positive ones.  Water does not seem to go all the way through and you end up with water leaking out the top (and your cup not getting totally filled). It's not a lot of water. At first I thought maybe I was filling it too much so I paid more attention and made sure to only fill it to the fill line (about 3/4 of the way). That didn't make a difference.That said it is easier to clean. All in all I might use it occasionally when the Solofill is dirty but I wouldn't buy it again if I had it to do over.", "I got this to cut down on the very high cost of Keurig single cup coffee makers and it fit my machine perfectly and made great coffee. It is easy to clean and reuse.Why four stars? Because of the amount of coffee you have to put in this to make it taste good. This is more about the whole Keurig system than just this cup, but I've found that I have to put nearly 25% of the total grounds I'd put in a normal 12 cup maker just to make one cup here. Not price effective. If you haven't already purchased a Keurig and are considering it, remember that this is a very expensive way to make coffee for people who enjoy coffee and will want more than a single cup a day.", "I 'inherited' a family member's extraKeurig B40 Elite Brewing Systemearly this year, and decided to move that into my office (replacing the French Press I'd used for years). I had a little pack of K-Cups, which were super convenient, but I ran out after a couple weeks. Searching online for more, I found the price for those things to be staggering. I decided to look for 'reusable K-Cup' and found this...I'm so glad I did. There is no reason to spend so much money on those little cups when you can have your own coffee for so much cheaper. Just get one of these cups, a grinder (many varieties available, I have a little electric Braun blade grinder though have read a burr grinder is preferable for this Ekobrew cup), and some whole-bean coffee and you're set to go. You can also use pre-ground coffee, but then what's the point of having a $120 coffee maker?Anyway, my thoughts:USEFULNESS: this is so useful. I use it every day at work at least once. It'll brew tea as well; just snip the top off a tea bag or two and pour into the cup.AFFORDABILITY: This single purchase will very quickly pay itself off. Within weeks, if you drink coffee regularly! This is more than 'affordable' -- it represents a significant savings, over time.QUALITY: high build quality; I've used mine hundreds of time by now I'd bet, and it's holding up fine. Heavy duty plastic construction, a durable hinge, and quality mesh mean this will last a LONG time...EASE OF USE: you have to be careful pouring the coffee in so as not to make a mess... and grinding your own coffee takes a little getting used to, but it's easy. Just grind, fill the container, and go -- the rest of the process is the same as a normal K-Cup.BOTTOM LINE: if you own a Keurig, get one of these. You might not think it's worth the effort, but give it a shot. I bet you'll be glad you did. I use this EVERY DAY and would never consider buying another K-Cup after experiencing the quality and ease-of-use this product represents.", "We got a keurig at work and, as delighted as I was to have one, I could not stomach paying for prepackaged cups of long ground coffee. Nor did it make the slightest sense to me that so many reusable cups require filters!This, however, is perfect. Incredibly quick and simple to fill and pop into the machine. Equally quick and easy to rinse out. No filters, no grounds in my cup, no mess. Any coffee I want. Lots of money saved and unnecessary trash avoided, and for a good price besides! I am recommending these to anyone I know who uses a keurig... it's worth every penny!", "I love my K-cup machine, but don't care for the limited choices available in decaf. Plus, the cost of a K-cup doesn't exactly set my toes a tappin.So I first tried the k-cap system that involves re-using an empty k-cup and snapping on a reusable plastic lid. Cheap? Yes. Works? No. End of story.Then tried a Solocup. This worked much better, but I found it difficult to dump out the used grounds. I like to put my used grounds in the compost pail rather than in the trash, and the Solocup really liked to hang onto the grinds unless you washed them down the drain. Plus, the Solocup hinge was poor, and broke within two weeks of use. But, you could use it without having to remove the cup holding insert in the machine.Moved to the my K-cup system from Kuring. I really liked this especially when I paired it with the Medelco RK202 filter. The deeper cup allowed for more coffee to be used for a stronger brew. Best of all they are easy to clean - just tap the bottom with a wooden spoon, and the grinds pop right out into the compost pail. The only downside is that you have to remove the insert to use the my K-cup.Saw the Ekobrew on a Gold Box deal and thought I'd give it a shot. So happy I did! It combines all the advantages of the my K cup approach (easy to clean) and the advantages of the Solocup (no need to remove the insert) plus adds one big advantage of it's own - you can use less coffee and still get a strong brew! It seems that the Ekobrew holds the water in contact with the coffee longer than the My K-cup, so I'm able to use about 15% less coffee, but still get the same strength. Delightful!!As with any K-cup replacement system, the grind fineness is critical to a good cuppa. I'm using a Breville Smart Grinder and a Barratza Vario, and both produce excellent results. It's not necessary to spend as much as I did on a grinder if you're only using drip (I also make a lot of espresso, and a good grinder is critical). But you'll want to move beyond a blade grinder to at least an entry level burr grinder. There are several decent ones in the $50 to $100 range that will do a great job.Or, you can use pre-ground. I find that Melitta pre-ground works very well since they offer a finer grind that provides good taste and little or no sediment.The build quality seems decent, but I'll update the review if problems crop up.Highly recommend!", "I do believe this little device will start saving me money right away.  I can get 80 KCups for $40 and now with this unit, I can try different coffee's that currently aren't made for the Keurig.  It does take some tweaking to figure out how much coffee you should put in the cup so that it is strong enough for you, but no so much that the water has difficulty flowing through.Clean up is a breeze as you dump it in the trash and then rinse out the remaining grounds in the sink.Off to go buy some Kona coffee!", "Although I appreciate the money-saving, environmentally-friendly principle behind the Ekobrew cup, I was disappointed in the end result.  First, the top of the cup doesn't close all the way, and I have to keep pressing it to keep it closed.  Even then, the top is not a tight fit.  When I use it in my Keurig machine, I get some leakage from the outer ring, which suggests that the cup has overflowed, probably through the not-quite-tight lid since I also get a few grounds in my cup.  The flavor is not as strong as I would expect, but again, that could be due to the lid not keeping the water in to force it through the grounds.I found the cup easy to clean and easy to use.  I like that it was designed to pop into my Keurig just as though it were a K-cup, without any adjustments, and it makes it easy to go between commercial K-cups and the Ekobrew, depending on what I have and want.  Still, even though I bought this back in February, I've used it only a handful of times because I don't like struggling with the top.The Ekobrew works, saves money, and allows me to use my own freshly ground coffee.  Does my Ekobrew coffee taste as good as it does when I brew it?  Absolutely not.  Is it more economical?  Yes.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "\"Since I knew I was being given a Cuisinart SS-700 for Christmas, I wanted to purchase the ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup - which works with Cuisinart as well as with Keurig - to minimize the cost associated with the prefilled K-cup.  I have not been disappointed in the performance of this product, nor has the coffee I have brewed been unacceptable.  I did find that a finer grind seems to allow me to brew a bolder coffee than some of the more coarsely commercially ground coffees do.  Using a more finely ground coffee allowed me to brew a 10 oz. mug of coffee for my morning wake-up.  Nevertheless, even the less finely ground coffees produce a nice 8 oz. cup of java.My only quibble with ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup is that it is a bit difficult to empty the wet grounds when you are finished brewing your cup of coffee.  The ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup required that I loosen the wet grounds with a spoon and then \"\"whack\"\" the refillable cup on the side of the trashcan.  The final bit of grounds had to be dislodged by holding the cup under running water.  While I am generally pleased with ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cups, the less than user-friendly emptying-after-use process cost the product a star.I recommend purchasing the 3-pack, if, in addition to regular coffee, you enjoy flavored coffees. By having three, you can enjoy different coffees on the same morning without having to clean the ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup immediately after each use.\"", "I'll add my two cents to the previous 4,900 reviews. We have an Ekobrew and several Target el cheapo refillables. We got the Ekobrew first and have had it for quite a while now with it getting pretty much daily use. It has held up fine to the use and to being cleaned in the dishwasher. The el cheapos work to, but the ekobrew is a nicer build to it and has an actual O ring. My wife runs these pretty much all the time with her either her own ground beans or off the shelf pre-ground stuff and it works fine.  If it gets to the point it fails, I would buy another.", "\"The ekobrew Cup is an excellent replacement for the My K-Cup insert I've been using. Why?1. It doesn't require removing the insert from the Keurig B60 I've got. So, it's quick. Also, there's no extra fiddling with the machine, which always makes me nervous.2. It doesn't leak like the My K-Cup. I don't know if it was user error or what, but I had about given up on using my own coffee in the brewer. Every time, I had water running different places it seems. This one is, apparently, idiot-proof. Not sure what I did wrong with the old device, but this one works without spilling or leaking.3. It's the same size as K-Cup, so it fits in the k-cup rack right beside the brewer. Convenient.4. The flow design really seem to put out a good cup of coffee. The flexibility of strength from using this is nice, and so is the economy of using loose coffee.I highly recommend this to any owner of a compatible Keurig. I'd suggest you double check ekobrew's website to make sure yours is on the \"\"works with\"\" list just to be sure, though.\"", "\"This Ecobrew reusable Keurig K-cup is great for brewing your own coffee. It seems to have been very well designed and is easy to use. One of the things I felt bad about when I bought my Keurig coffee maker was the fact that although it was a great convenient coffee maker... it does tend to produce lots of waste when you buy the disposable k-cups.  I think this product also ends up saving you lots of money in the long run too. K-cups can be quite expensive.  I really love this product and I really can't find anything bad to say about it. There is another product called the Solofill that essentially does the same thing but is made from another company. I own both products and if you're curious to how they stack up against one another, check out the paragraph below. You may want to do research to make sure that your Keurig coffee maker is compatible with the EcoBrew or Solofill. I know that some K-cup coffee makers are not compatible with these products. I own the MR. Coffee single K-cup coffee maker and can say that it's compatible with both of these products.  If you want to know more about the Mr. Coffee Keurig coffee maker, feel free to read my review on that as well :)EcoBrew VS SolofillFirst off, I'd like to state that I purchased both the Solofill and the Ecobrew.  Both of these products are really great reusable Keurig filters that let you brew your own coffee in a Keurig coffee maker.  These essentially let you make your own K-cups with your own coffee... and they're reusable!  I would rate the Solofill as 4.5 Stars out of 5 and the Ecobrew as a 5 out of 5 Star Product.  The Ecobrew is a bit better than the Solofill because it is easier to rinse out. The Solofill tends to collect grinds at the very bottom and it's very hard to get the few last grinds out. The Ecobrew also fits better in my Mr Coffee single cup K-cup brewer. The Ecobrew seems to have a slightly larger capacity for coffee grinds too, which may mean it's capable of brewing slightly stronger coffee. And lastly, the Ecobrew has a flat bottom that can sit on a counter top by itself. This makes it much easier to fill than the Solofill. With the Solofill, it couldn't be balanced on a table-top so I had to cut out the bottom of a small dixie cup to make my own \"\"stand\"\" in order to fill it properly.\"", "\"First off, let me say I'm dis-heartened to see people marking \"\"not helpful\"\" on people's reviews who didn't have success with the item! Sheesh! Looks like my review is no exception.My friend gifted me this item a few months ago. I had already tried to Solofill and the Kuerig My K-Cap. Wasn't impressed with either. This one is the best out of the bunch, though there are caveats.Initially, I followed all the instructions to a T. I filled the coffee to the fill line, made sure there were no grounds on the lid and placed it in my Keurig. Most times, I would end up with coffee dripping after the cup was pulled away, 8oz when I had pressed 10oz and a cup of coffee that took about 3X as long to brew when compared to using a K-Cup. Thanks to reviewer Thomas B Goodloe, I now realize that filling the Ekobrew to the fill line is NOT a good idea. And tamping it doesn't isn't a great idea either. Go a little less than the fill line and don't tamp down - I think you'll have better success.So, how's the coffee? So so. It's not as great as using a K-cup, period. There are particles in the coffee after brewing with the Ekobrew - the coffee with look a tad hazy. I've been using Dunkin Donuts coffee, so your mileage may very with coffee strength, grind, etc. It's the best out of the three I've tried, but still more hassle than it's worth.\"", "\"I love my Keurig brewer, but I have been increasingly unhappy about the wastefulness of the disposable k cups, the quality of the coffee and the huge expense.  I've tried other refillable k cups but they are difficult to use - you have to remove things, they often drip in weird ways, etc.The Ecobrew is wonderful!  Easy to use, easy to clean and now I'm using my favorite coffees from my local coffee roaster!  It is not as convenient as the disposable kcups but the coffee is so much better (make sure you grind it \"\"drip\"\", if its too fine you'll get grounds in your cup).  Thank you - I'll be buying a couple more to have on hand for the holidays and gifts for my Keurig owning friends!\"", "\"Years ago, I used the \"\"My K-Cup\"\" brand refillable cup, but had a bad experience with it.  So I moved back to regular disposable K-Cups.  Then I eventually discovered the Ekobrew and figured I'd try it out, since the reviews were positive.  I've been using Ekobrew for over a year now, and find it to be an effective way to use your own coffee grounds (and save some money).  Cleaning it out takes a little bit of effort, so I typically stick to disposable K-Cups for rushed weekdays, and use the Ekobrew on laid-back weekend mornings.\"", "I fill the cup with two rounded coffee scoops-ful and it brews perfectly every time. Sometimes I even get a ground or two in the seal and it still does not leak. That's not to say that it won't down the road, but it's doing great so far. I had been using the My-Kaps, which work well, but they're more fussy to deal with and require that you have a supply of used K cups at hand. This one: open, dump old grounds, refill, snap lid closed and pop it in! Use over and over.", "I got a Keurig coffee system this past Christmas.  Rather than talk all about the pros and cons of the machine itself, let me just say that my only true complaint with it is the relentless weak coffee it makes.  I have tried everything out there that promises to be a strong brew only to be disappointed.  And it is my opinion that if you like your coffee to have a real wallop to it that you will be as disappointed with the machine as I was... The only real solution to it has been for me to pick up my own mud swill and use one of these refillable cups.. And its been a well placed, and tasty investment indeed...Make no mistake about it, this thing is a pain to use over the k-cups.  You gotta fill it each time and then wash it out that is very tedious.  (It's better if you wait for it to dry out and then its much easier).  But it's the only way in my opinion to get a good strong cup of java out of this thing.  This new and improved Ecobrew really is the better choice. I owned a couple of the other kinds that are sold locally and they all leaked, were harder to clean, etc., including an earlier version of this one that leaked the brew over the top that worked, but still made a little bit of a mess.  This newest one that has the reinforced top really does work the best.  It really doesn't spill over at all, and, its about as easy to clean as one of these things gets.  In conclusion, if you own one of these machines and are disappointed in it for the tasteless tea like coffee it brews, I highly recommend this Ecobrew for its ease of use, and for getting a real strong cup of coffee back into your morning.. : )", "I've used Keurigs for about 7 years (before home models were being made) and reusable filter for 2 years).  Here's what you need to know:USE REUSABLESThese are better than disposables for a few reasons:1. can get the coffee and/or blend of your choice - not limited to what comes in k-cups2. costs much less per cup3. less waste created / environmentally friendly4. downside is inconvenience, but see HOW TO USE below for lessons learned from a veteranWHICH ONE TO GETEkobrew is the best design.  I've used solofill, Keurig's my k-cup, and ekobrew.  All work ok but:1. My Kcup has more parts to clean, leaked more grinds into the coffee too.2. Solofill is good but not quite as good as ekobrew.  Side walls and water distributor on ekobrew is better.  And with the flat bottom, the ekobrew is easier to clean.  Coffee grinds get annoyingly stuck in the bottom of the solofill, whereas the Ekobrew can be rinsed out in one shot.  Solofill is probably fine if you make one cup a day and put it in the dishwasher.  But I make a bunch and the inconvenience of the solofill cleaning was enough to make me prefer the disposables over it.3. Ekobrew got the whole thing right.  Side walls allow you to fill 2/3 with coffee and make an ideal brew - water has room to mix with the coffee.  The water distributes very well through the perforated funnel on top.  And cleaning is easy (see how to clean #5).HOW TO USE - FOR CONVENIENCE AND GOOD COFFEEThis is actually really important.  Until I got it down to a system by trial and error to have it (1) not take much extra time compared to a disposable and (2) tasting good (not weak), I kept going back and forth on using these vs. disposables for the convenience factor.  But with these steps I am fully converted to using the reusables.1. Put your ground coffee in a Tupperware container.  I like something that will hold about a bag of coffee and is relatively deep (not wide and short) so it's easy to scoop out of it.  This make it very convenient to scoop 2/3 of a container full of coffee, shake the extra back into the container.  Keep it air tight in the cabinet with your mugs (or in the refrigerator).  Much more convenient than trying to scoop from a bag or than using a spoon to scoop into the cup.2. Blend your coffee if you like.  If you're like me and drink lots of cups a day, using the tupperware method  (1 above) allows very easy mixing.  I pour half a bag of decaf and caffeinated each into the container and shake well.  Use a somewhat stronger blend than you might otherwise get since Keurig brews fast I do find the final flavor is less strong than if you got the same at Starbucks for instance.3. Scoop 2/3 of the ekobrew with coffee.  You want the coffee just above the bottom of the sidewall so water won't seep out without going through the coffee, but not too high that there's no room for the coffee to push thru (it will leak out and around the sides then).  Make sure your ekobrew is completely dry, and then you can scoop with it directly and not try to spoon it in).  Wipe off the sides back into the tupperware and close.4. Brew like a normal k-cup.5. Cleaning.  This is really important to keep it from being inconvenient and took a while to work out.a. Do this right after brewing - do not let the grinds sit in the ekobrew or they will harden and be more difficult to clean outb. Pick the ekobrew up by the top sides (not hot there) and you can walk it over to the sink over your brewed coffee so it doesn't drip on the counter / floorc. Open the top and hold it upside down directly over the drain and low (so the grinds don't spread all over the place)d. Rinse through the bottom with cold water, with the cup upside down.  All the grinds should come out in one quick shot and go right down the draine. Shake and set to dry.6. Have more than one of these if you like several cups a day.  You have to wait until they are completely dry to reuse or else the scooping method (#3) won't work.Using these steps above, I've completely replaced the disposables without it being materially less convenient.  I get the coffee of my choice and its much less expensive, and there's no waste.Enjoy!", "My husband had a colleague put a Keurig brewer in their office which intrigued my coffee loving husband. I know he wasn't up to paying the per cup cost of K-cups and is pretty particular about the coffee he drinks. So he purchased this for himself and takes his coffee to work every day. He likes that he can put his own coffee in it, brew and reuse. It washes up well and transports conveniently.He has been looking at buying his own machine but we already have too many appliances on our counter so I hope he refrains for now.But the fact that he can still partake of the office coffee maker under his own terms works great.", "I bought the two pack of Ekobrew Cups for my Cuisinart SS-700 Single Serve Brewing System. The unit comes with an extra cup, but it is a real pain to use because you have to remove the k cup holster.  These ekobrew cups can be dropped right in without removing anything. I use the brown cup for coffee and the green cup for tea. Easy way to organize them.  I get the best brew, coffee and tea, with these ekobrew cups. I can fit in a larger amount of coffee or tea, making the drink stronger. I love that these are waste free. They are very durable. I am actually using up my loose tea now.  The clean  up is simple  I just invert the cup over the trash can and gently tap/shake out the used grounds.  One quick rinse after that and it is clean. I clean it once a week in the top rack,of the dishwasher.  I make at least 100 oinces of beverages a day with my machine and these ekobrew cups. Super happy with the ekobrew cups and would highly recommend to anyone.I bought another set of these so I can prefill all my coffee at once. I put them in the dishwasher and one of the lids ripped off. Amazon sent me another set immediately. The customer service is awesome!", "Bought this for a friend who has a Keurig Kcup machine. It works great. You can use any kind of coffee you want to. Too bad it is not offered for the Starbucks Verismo system which I have!", "I like the convenience of the Keurig coffee maker that we recently purchasedKeurig White Brewer B318but it's difficult to find good decaf coffee pods. They're also expensive when you figure the cost per pound. This little stainless steel cup allows us to use our own favorite coffee and it's not much more trouble than using a pod. It's really the best of both worlds.  It's well designed and fits into my Keurig perfectly.  I fill it about 3/4 full and close the little hinged top. (Be sure to brush any coffee grounds off the edge of the cup so it closes fully.) Then I just set it in the machine where the coffee pods normally go and press the button to brew. When the coffee is ready it only takes a minute to clean this little cup. There are even rubber tabs on the side edges so you don't burn your fingers on the hot stainless cup. I just rinse it out and it's ready for the next use.  Best of all, I can use my favorite coffeePeet's Coffee & Tea Major Dickason's Blend Grind Coffee, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 2)(but I buy the decaf which isn't available on Amazon.) I've never used any filters with this cup and I don't see any reason to. The coffee comes out  perfect.This refillable cup looks to be very well made and since it's stainless steel it should last a very long time. Considering the cost of the pods compared to the cost of a pound of coffee, it shouldn't take long for this to pay for itself. And we still have the Keurig convenience of a cup of fresh coffee quickly. We do still use some of the pods as well, but I'd say I use this refillable cup about 75% of the time.  Great product!", "We use this Refillable K-Cup and K-cups too. I looked at the negative reviews to see what the problems were and we have not encountered any similar problems. We have not experienced any leaking and it cleans out really easy. It appears to be well made and very easy to use. Just fill it, close the cap, put it in and wait for your coffee. The only things I can figure are that some might be using too fine of a coffee ground that prevents the water from easily going through, sort of forming mud, the other being that the coffee may be a cheap variety that takes a lot of grounds to make a decent cup of coffee. Right now we are completely satisfied with the results from this Ekobrew Refillable K-Cup.", "Three weeks ago (on Black Friday) the Keurig coffee makers went on sale at a great price and so &#8211; after procrastination for almost a year because of the price of the Keurigs &#8211; I bought the Office Pro model because it is sturdily built. I knew in advance that I wanted to use refillable cups because I could choose my coffee, have it freshly ground and save a lot. Besides, it&#8217;s environmentally a good idea.I read the reviews of a number of the products &#8211;The Office Pro will not accept Keurig&#8217;s proprietary &#8220;My K-Cup&#8217; &#8211; including Solofill, Ekobrew and Caf&eacute; Cup.  All had good and bad reviews (but so do many things). The Solofill was the most expensive (about $12 for one) so I saved that for last. As you will see, as you read on, I found my solution between the other two. This will be a &#8220;combined&#8221; review which I will post on both the Ekobrew and Caf&eacute; Cup listings.First I bought an Ekobrew. You get one for about $8.00. I tried it and found that it worked okay but I found some grounds were getting into the cup. I had quite a few pounds of pre-ground Starbucks coffee and they are ground to the basic &#8220;filter brew&#8221; fineness. The coffee was hot tasty but the grounds annoyed me. Then I saw the Caf&eacute; Cup at Rite Aid Drugstore and they come FOUR to a pack for $9.99, Even though the reviews for it were often negative, I figured I&#8217;d try anyway.When I used the same coffee as I used with the Ekobrew I noticed no grounds in the cup and the coffee was hot and tasty. Looking at both units, they are similar with wire mesh on both the sides and the bottom. It just looked like the holes in the Ekobrew were larger. Both were easy to clean.I also bought a box of Starbucks pre-filled K-cups. They worked great of course &#8211; but at about twice the price of filling my own.The negative reviews of the Cafe Cup said they were cheaply made. When I compare it with the Ekobrew I will say the plastic is a little thinner but I&#8217;ve been using one of the four at least twice a day for three weeks and it&#8217;s holding up just fine. When I finish brewing the coffee, I open it and empty it under running water and all the grounds come out. I certainly don&#8217;t expect to mishandle the Caf&eacute; Cup so I can&#8217;t see how it will easily break. And it&#8217;s making the same (or better) coffee than the Ekobrew at FOUR times the cost.It took a few days to experiment with other ground coffees I have to see which work best in the Ekobrew, but I&#8217;m leaning towards the Caf&eacute; Cup as the one refillable one I&#8217;ll use most. It&#8217;s also nice to have a couple as I can fill two when I make my breakfast and use the second one without having to refill the first. (By the way, I used to wait five minutes for my Mr. Coffee to brew. The Keurig does it in 50 seconds.I should also point out that you can&#8217;t compare the refillable K-Cups to the hermetically sealed ones. The reason is that there is no screen for the coffee to come out with the packaged ones. They have solid sides and bottom and the machine punctures a hole in the bottom to let the brew reach your cup.So in my test of the Caf&eacute; Cup vs. the Ekobrew, the budget priced Caf&eacute; Cup won &#8211; on value as well as letting less grounds into my cup. But I do recommend at least trying one of these to use at least sometimes. You will cut waste and save about 50% and have better control on the coffee beans you use.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;", "Like many, I bought theKeurig K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filterwhen I bought myKeurig Elite. I've used it only a few time. It's a hassle and (in my experience) leaks all over. When I saw the ekobrew Cup on Amazon, it looked like it would really work, and with a lot less mess. My only concern was that it would also leak. In fact, it works perfectly. The only caveat is that, because the filter is a screen instead of paper, one has to take care not to use coffee that is too finely ground.With my first attempt, some grounds were released into my cup of coffee. Ever since(perhaps because I was careful to make sure the top was closed tightly), grounds virtually never escape into the cup. As I write this, I'm drinking some Folgers Black Silk, a little sample packet left on the front door (not great coffee). I haven't tried the Solofill Cup so I cannot make a comparison, and like the Solofill, the hinge on the ekobrew will probably give out eventually. However, that shouldn't be a problem except for the possibility of losing the lid.Bottom line: you don't have to be cheap to use this filter. Sometimes I spot coffee that I'd like to use but doesn't come in K-Cups (Starbucks, for example), and I do like some of Trader Joe's coffees, none of which come in K-Cups--like their Sumatra Ultra Dark Blend. Keep in mind that the ekobrew cups can make stronger coffee; they hold more coffee than normal K-Cups do, exceptGreen Mountain Revv, which contains about the same amount of coffee that the ekobrew holds. (I periodically cut open the K-Cups and empty the used coffee into our compost, so I have seen that the inner filter of most brands is smaller than the filters for Revv.) This means that you can use dark coffees and generally get more flavor than you would with most K-Cup extra-bolds such asBlack Tiger. The ekobrew is also handy for those unfortunate times when you run out of real K-Cups. Highly recommended.", "\"I have been using the solofill  refillable cup for about a year and it has worked fine except for a broken \"\"O\"\" ring (about $4 for two replacements). I decided to try the ekobrew as a back-up unit and here are the reasons I think it is an upgrade:1. The ekobrew cup is a little taller. You use the same amount of coffee but there is a little head room for the water to reach more grounds.2. The water disperser in the lid is larger so I think it would spread the water over a larger area .3. The bottom of the cup is flat making it easier to fill and you don't have the little \"\"nipple\"\" on the bottom to clean out like the solofill.4. The little \"\"ears\"\" on the cup slip right into the depressions on the coffee maker so there is no worry about turning it the wrong way  and hitting the bottom  needle.5. Customer service is great. The first cup I got (green) had a defective lid which didn't fit tightly enough and sprayed water all over. I contactedcustomer service and they sent a replacement right away. Works great.Recommended for people who want to use their own coffee instead of the K-cups.  I save my K-cups for guests and special occasions or when I'm in too big of a hurry to fill the refillable cups.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.04459477588534355, 0.030015749856829643, 0.03829595446586609, 0.03890962526202202, 0.04122612997889519, 0.040614668279886246, 0.04177652671933174, 0.0391058623790741, 0.027757782489061356, 0.038732219487428665, 0.03324846178293228, 0.038580890744924545, 0.04323884844779968, 0.03512663021683693, 0.028299568220973015, 0.03987084701657295, 0.044672705233097076, 0.04040315002202988, 0.037619538605213165, 0.03474392741918564, 0.04257554933428764, 0.041188422590494156, 0.03248276561498642, 0.03903476148843765, 0.0442802794277668, 0.04360438883304596]]}
