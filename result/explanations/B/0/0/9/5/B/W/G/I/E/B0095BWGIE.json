"], "reviews": ["Packaged in an attractive zippered white faux leather case, this skin care duo is encased in metal tubes. The Extreme Plus Repair has a roller ball tip while the Extreme Eclat Instant has a soft sable brush at the end of the container. Product is dispensed by pressing a button at the bottom of the tube. One or two presses was sufficient for my needs.The Extreme Plus Repair contains algae exptracts, bioplasma, marine plant dna and Hyaluronic Acid. The Extreme Eclat contains ginseng, fruit acids, vitamins, plant and algae extracts.Frankly, I was more impressed with the applicators than I was with the product. The applicators are fun to use and assist in precision application. The roller ball is reputed to assist with lymphatic drainage. The brush had a nice, soft feel. After about two weeks of use, I found the Eclat somewhat more effective than the Plus Repiar. The eclat had a light perfume scent that I did not care for and the results were subtle. It does leave the skin smooth and soft with minimal tightening. The Plus Repair had no scent and its effects to date were unremarkable.  I did not experience any irritation or allergic reactions and I do have sensitive skin. However I cannot say that the results thus far are superior to even the drug store brands.  I intend to completely use both and will update my review if that changes.On the negative side the instructions are skimpy and are contained on a little leaflet. the leaflet has information on all of their products and in a number of languages. It was annoying to have to weed through all the langauages and products to find the english instructions. and then, the information provided was minimal.  I also noted that the tubes were not sealed in any manner. Although they are attractive, the metal tube and brush of the Eclat fell apart. I was able to put it back together but it does raise questions about overall quality.This product is worth a try if you temper your expectations. I did not experience amazing and instant improvement but was not displeased with the results. The applicators are genius, easy and fun. The carrying case is cute and sturdy and the black interior and small mirror were thoughtful touches. If amazon had half stars, I would give this three and one-half for superior application of a pedestrian product.", "\"It's too early for me to tell if this really diminishes wrinkles; I'll update my review later. The AINHOA \"\"specific\"\" product did seem to have an almost immediate tightening feeling on my face, but nothing dramatic (time will tell, though). The packaging of the product is great. It comes with a nice carrying case that has a mirror, so it's perfect for traveling. The applicators make it much easier to apply than the traditional bottle moisturizers.  My only minor complaint is that the \"\"extreme instant\"\" product smells strongly of perfume, and I prefer beauty products that are unscented.UPDATE 1/26/13: I stopped using the product because I had a reaction to it.  The skin around my eye swelled and stayed that way for about a week.\"", "\"This product, which is suppose to help your skin look younger, is beautifully packaged and feels very good going on. That is about all I can say about it in the positive mode.First the instructions. They are very poor. Very basic. I wasn't sure from reading them how to use the applicators and figured it out - you press the button on the bottom of the applicator and the lotions come out. One is for day use and the other for night use. I found that they both irritate my eyes and have to keep it pretty much keep the product away from my lower lids which then negates the purpose of it. And I did try and search for the website for the product, but my virus detector came up with all sorts of alerts saying there were infected items on the website and would not let me click on it (not that I would after their warnings).  So that was not good news.My skin did feel smoother, but no where in the instructions does it address whether or not you can put a moisturizer on after the product dries and sinks into your skin. I believe the product is made in Spain, but I live in Chicago and it is cold and dry in the winter and moisturizing is a must!So basically, I'm not sure this product does much. It seems to tighten your skin while it is being used, but other than that--the instructions are poor and it is hard to know if you are using it most effectively. For instance the instructions on the box for the extremem eclat state \"\"Apply to the face, neck and neckline with the help of the brush applicator. Leave to absorb. Avoid direct contact with the eyes. Clean the brush applicator with a tissue after use.\"\" Doesn't really address how much to put on or how deeply to massage it into your skin. The liquid that the brush distributes from the tube goes on smoothly in places and lumpy in others so you need to either smooth it in or brush it across your face.The solution in the \"\"Extreme Eclat Instant\"\" tube contains Ginseng, fruit acids, Vitamins, plant extracts, , algae extracts. The solution in the Extreme Plus Repair tube is composed of Algae extracts, bioplasma, Marine Plant DNA, and Hyaluronic Acid according to the instructions inside the box. However, if you read the box there is a long list of ingredients including water and other strange words that would take me way too long to type but with a lot of them ending in common additive endings.However on a really positive note, I really like the case the two tubes came in--kind of white leather with a mirror inside. It will make a nice make up case for my bag when I've exhausted the solutions.\"", "This product is pleasant to use and makes my skin feel lovely for a couple of hours,  but that is about all it does.  I do like the feel of my skin when I'm done (been using for a  couple of weeks now)You do notice that this is one of the few pricey products that makes no outrageous claims of making you look years younger in the blink of an eye, or to reduce years? I must tell you how I appreciate this...there really is nothing a topical, over-the-counter  product can do. You should go to your dermatologist for something you need a prescription for, if you want permanent changes.  I don't understand why we get caught up in the fallacy of it all.BUT this product makes no such claims --- yet it does make my skin look a bit better after using it --- my make-up looks much better, goes on easier and stays on longer after using the Extreme Eclat Instant.This product does make the skin around my eyes burn a bit.As far as the night time product, Extreme Plus Repair, I see no changes in my 'turkey wattle' or my crows feet OR the lines that make me look like an old-fashioned puppet, around my mouth!  I am 55 years old with mid-range wrinkles.  They are noticeable but no too  deep yet.Another complaints I have is that the directions you DO get are very vague and difficult to find on the product sheet that comes with this.  Also the packaging really is pretty BUT it is falling apart on me, the lid will not stay on and is driving me crazy having to search it down twice a day!.", "While this product looks fantastic and feels nice when you put it on, the actual results after a month of use aren't anything to brag about. I might not be using it right though, the instructions are vague and I have been brushing the day cream on wrinkled areas in the morning and then rolling on the night cream on those same spots before bed. The cream is thick and clear without a noticeable scent. It takes quite some time to dry and my face feels tacky to the touch after using. If I use it on crows feet i got a bit of irritation spots where the skin is thin, almost like a rash.With a product like this I would expect significant instructions detailing how to use it and what exactly it does. Unfortunately the info on this product is nearly non-exstant.", "First, let me say, that my skin is incredibly sensitive to almost everything and prone to quick break outs; for these reasons I was scared to use this product. However, from the 1st use I had no problems, none: no break outs, no bumps, no burning, none. The first morning after I used the Extreme Plus Repair I noticed a smoothness and a healthy shine to my skin. I was impressed. I washed my face with a face cloth and just water then I applied the Extreme Eclat Instant under my makeup, it worked wonderfully. All day my makeup looked smooth and nicely matted. I was nicely surprised and greatly appreciative of how well these products worked.Now, they are not cheap, about $50 to $60 bucks a piece, but considering how well they work they're worth it.", "I love AINHOA, their mascara is one of my favorites.  This extreme pack was quite intriguing when I received it.  Top notch packaging and quality, a chic little white case. The roller and brush are pleasant to use and makes for very accurate, non-messy application.  This is a great skincare product to take traveling.  I have been using the extreme pack for two weeks now and I can't see any discernible difference other than some breakouts on my extremely sensitive skin.  The breakout is not cool, so I have to discontinue use.  If you have the cash to spare and your skin is a bit tougher than mine, give it a go.  I do think it usually takes a month of using anti-aging products to see a difference.", "I got this to review through the Amazon vine program.  The product comes in a very nice case, it is faux white leather with a nice zip closure.  There is a nice little mirror in the case as well.  In there you get two cylinders of product.  One is the Extreme Repair Plus and the other is the Extreme Eclat Instant.The instructions that are included with this are tough to use.  There are in super tiny print and you have to search through four or five languages to get to the English instructions.  Even once I found them I had to read the instructions a few times to figure out what to do with these two products.I have combination skin that is sensitive and breaks out easily.  My current skin care regiment involves usingSmashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primerunder my makeup for moisture and staying power andBoscia Enlivening Amino-Ag Eye Treatmentaround my eyes.  At night I moisturize withCetaphil Daily Advance Lotion for Dry Sensitive Skin.The Extreme Repair Plus is meant to be an overnight treatment.  You are supposed to apply to areas susceptible to wrinkles and leave on overnight.  This applies with a roller ball.  You basically push the button on the bottom to pump out product and then roller ball it out on problem areas.  I am not all that keen on a roller ball application because all the dirt/oil from you face is just being rolled back into the product.I used the Extreme Repair Plus for three days and had a lot of problems with it.  When I applied to my forehead and wrinkles around eyes it burned. My eyes also burned and watered even though the product wasn't that close to my eyes.  I ended up with red swollen eyes that burned and felt dry.  I finally stopped using after three days because the discomfort didn't fade or go away.The Extreme Eclat Instant is supposed to be worn under your makeup for an instant face lift.  This is pumped out from a button on the bottom of the container and comes out through a brush at the end.  It is an interesting application method, but the brush is pretty coarse so you end up having to rub the product in with your fingers to even it out.  I used this under my makeup in place of mySmashbox Photo Finish Foundation Primer.The Extreme Eclat Instant was even worse for my skin than the Repair Plus was.  It was very oily and caused my makeup to look glossy and smear easily.  After using it for three days my skin started to breakout everywhere.  A week after using it I am still trying to recover; my skin it red and blotchy and dried out. In addition to all of this it has a flowery scent to it that gave me a headache.So while the packaging is very pretty and the application methods are interesting; this product was a disaster for me.  The Extreme Repair Plus made my eyes and skin burn.  The Extreme Eclat Instant was very oily, caused my whole face to go red, blotchy, and break out, and in addition to that had a sweet floral scent that I had trouble with.I know skin products work differently for every individual.  I would just caution those with sensitive skin prone to breakouts against trying this product.  It was pretty much a painful disaster for me.  Mainly I am grateful I received this for free through the Vine program, otherwise I would be really angry at wasting so much money on this product.", "I am interested in almost anything that relates to maintaining beautiful skin. When I saw this Ainhoa product and saw that it was for the face I admit that I reacted too hasty. I have not as of yet begun to suffer the effects of aging in my face.  Meaning that when I go to the Carnival I win every time.  So getting an age defining? Wrinkle reducing? Skin toning? I have no idea what this products exact purpose is.  I should have investigated a little more before I selected it.With that being said, I will admit that I used the daytime product. I have no clue if I used it properly or not because the instructions with in the box are extremely vague. As for what to look out for as an end result, well I still do not know.Now, there was no difference in my skin appearance or tone.  My skin did not feel any more firm than before. So I just shrugged and said oh well I will wait and see if anything happens over a weeks period of time.  Well after a week of instructed use. There still is no difference in anything.So why 3 stars?  I am thankful that it did not work in reverse for one.  I did not breakout or have a bad reaction to the product for two and the packaging/storage case is nice, three.There you have it folks, sorry I could not be of more help.", "\"The first thing you will notice about this product is the innovative and deluxe packaging.  The two products come in a nice leather case that would make them ideal for travelling, and also both feature interesting application processes.  One uses a brush - with the cream coming through the brush so you can \"\"brush on\"\" the moisturizer.  The other has a ball to apply the serum.  While both applicators are innovative and interesting, I do worry about the cost that goes into this level of packaging, as I prefer products that spend the money on the actual product.  Also, I don't know if my concerns are valid, but I worry about the hygiene of the brush, since it stays caked in moisturizer all the time.On to the products...  I find skin care is a very personal choice, as everyone has different skin that reacts differently to different products.  These feel to be extreme moisturizers that do a great job, and as other reviewers have noted I can see how some skin reacts very positively.  However, I prefer a cream that leaves my skin feeling moisturized but relatively dry.  With both of these products there was a bit of an oil sheen left on my skin that I did not find as pleasant as other creams I use.  That being said - they do a great job at moisturizing.The product would be enhanced if they gave a more detailed instruction sheet.  It comes from a Spanish company, and can be a little confusing.\"", "I like this moisturizer and it feels great on my winter dry skin.  I do wish the instructions included would have 'instructed' me how to properly use these.  There is nothing saying which to use first, or if for day, night, under foundation etc.I like the brush applicator the best, as it easily smooth the product over your face and neck.  The roller ball didn't dispense as easily and I'm not a fan of applying undue pressure to my 40-something face and neck.I simply used this each night before bed for several weeks and my skin feels very soft.  I don't think it diminished the appearance of fine lines, however, I'll keep trying.I do massage this lotion into my skin after applying with the brush, otherwise it feels like it just lays on my skin.I welcome comments with the correct procedure for use.  The company website provided zero help.", "I'm not basing my review on the price of this item, but I feel a lot of the price paid must be going to the packaging, and not the product itself.  I must say I love the way the product comes.  It's in a nice little case with a small mirror that can and will be reused as a small travel case for cosmetics.  Secondly, the two tubes of product come in nifty applicators.  Instructions are sparse, so you are pretty much left guessing how to use these things.  Here's how I used them, and my impression.  The first product I applied at night, with the applicator that has a ball on the end (think of a large ball point pen).  You press out a little product with a button on the bottom and rub it over your face.  It feels wonderful, the ball is very cold and just rolls the cream onto your face.  A few minutes after using it, though, it felt pretty tingly, which didn't bother me, and which I hoped meant it was working away to improve my skin. It left my skin very soft, but slightly sticky.  In the morning, I've been applying the second product, and again the applicator is very nice, a soft brush that spreads the cream onto the areas you wish to treat.  Again, you push a button to control how much you use.  This product feels great, but after using both for several weeks, I'm not seeing the kind of improvement I was hoping for, or any improvement at all. So I will continue to use my regular products, but may use these applicators to spread them around!", "\"I am 46 years old, and live in a very dry area where we also use a wood stove to heat our house, causing more dryness.  I am always looking for something to hydrate my skin, face and hair.  This AINHOA specific extreme pack is like nothing I have ever used before and I am very happy with the results.This arrived in a very nice hard carrying case that zips close for travel.  Inside are your two silver tubes of product with a push button on the bottom to dispense the product into the roller or brush, depending on which one you are using.  I am using both and like another reviewer, I noticed (even my family noticed!) a huge difference immediately.  You have to try this to believe it.  The applicators are very nice, the brush is soft and the roller ball applicator works well.  I found that you have to be a little more careful with the ball applicator pen because it does dispense quite a bit of product with one push of the button.  One push was enough for me to do my entire face.  Once I applied these, I noticed a huge different in the lines around my eyes, and on my forehead.  They almost disappeared after just one use! I know that sounds impossible, and I would not have believed it myself unless I had actually tried this.  I would highly recommend this product, my face looks firmer and feels better, so much more hydrated which I think was part of my problem, I don't have that sallow, dry looking face, but it looks moist and \"\"plump\"\" in a fantastic way.\"", "And that's not a good thing, and there wasn't much on the box or the Amazon page either. When I picked this pair of skin care treatments off the Vine newsletter I really didn't know quite what I was getting - were these supposed to be used as a moisturizer (day/night), or as skin repair used in conjunction with a daily moisturizer? Unfortunately, the very tiny and hard to understand instruction sheet wasn't terribly helpful - multiple languages, and discusses more products than these two. Incredibly tiny font too, which is rather odd considering the products are aimed at people who are getting older. When I finally found something in English, I couldn't always tell if it was for the right product, so I went in rather blind and may not have used it according to the instructions I couldn't find...The products have unusual dispensers, instead of a pump at the top, the Extreme Plus Repair is like a pen that you hold to your face and push down at the thingy at the other end to dispense the fluid. The Extreme Eclat Instant has a brush at one end, and you push at the other end to dispense the liquid onto the brush. Apparently you're supposed to brush around the age lines, but I repeat - the instructions are not very clear (and pretty damn small print at that). I have a smallish bathroom with not much counter space on the vanity. Those products that do stay on said counter need to stand up so they take up less room, and with the push thingy at the bottom of these makes these easy to topple over. A minor quibble, but a deal breaker for me.Not knowing whether I should be using a daily/nightly moisturizer along with these, I did not use one. It is January and it is cold and my skin is dry and flaky. These products without a daily moisturizer for a week made my skin flakier than normal. I did notice some tightening of the skin, but not dramatic improvement on the wrinkles.  All in all, not a product worth the asking price. I'm going back to Olay.", "\"I am in my late 40s with a few squint lines around my eyes, very light laugh lines on my cheeks and serious lines under my chin.  I opened the package and was impressed with the case and the two pen like applicators.  Then I looked at the instruction sheet.  There are instructions in just about every language spoken and in very small print.  Let's face it, if you need something to repair older skin, tiny print is not going to be very readable.  I pulled out the reading glasses and scanned through all the instructions to find English and then read through.  There really wasn't much there other than a blurb about what the products were made of.  Also, the instructions contained descriptions for several products, not just the two in the package.  Sad to say, I resorted to the description on Amazon to see which applicator was for day and which was for night.  One product has a brush and applies the product smoothly.  You push the button on the bottom of the applicator and the product comes out between the bristles of the brush.  I smoothed it on all the \"\"aged\"\" places on my face. The other applicator has a ball on the end and the product is pushed up around the ball and it applies like roll-on deodorant.  It's easy to accidentally get too much of this product.  I've used both for a little over a week and can see a little difference in the lines beside my eyes.  Under my chin is very improved as this was the most damaged skin I have.  My cheeks still have the same amount of laugh lines and I still have a deep crease in my forehead. The products are not irritating and feel good, not sticky or greasy.  I'm not big on wearing makeup but when I did, it went on smoothly over the product.\"", "This product was reviewed by a 62 year old woman. The pen was easy to apply, the serum that came out was gel like and while was a good moisturizer, after several weeks of diligent use the wrinkles were not visibly reduced and I think that is the biggest claim this product makes and the whole point of the product. It's awful expensive for just a moisturizer.", "I was unsure why this product was priced so high ($150) and I now see it has dropped to under $20.  Very strange.  Either way, the product did a great job of moisturizing during this very dry (for us) winter.  However, it did not do much better of a job than your typical drugstore bought brand, but we believe it was in fact better.  It is possible I expected too much from the product given the original exorbitant price tag.The product is well packaged but did not include instructions. It comes with a nice case and small mirror making it ideal for travel.  We found the application of the evening product worked good at diminished crease lines while the day product worked good under foundation makeup. The scent of the product is very minor and not too strong.  However, this product seems to be prone toward encouraging pimples.  After just a few applications we noticed breaking out on the forehead.  We discussed continued use and it cleared up right away.  Researching other reviews led us to conclude that some people with sensitive or fair skin will be prone to breaking out. If your skin can tolerate the product, it will be softer and smoother after about a week of use.Once again, I simply may have expected too much from this product based on the original price point.  But, in short, we believe the same benefits would be obtained by using nearly any other moisturizer.", "The AINHOA Specific Extreme pack features two products that come in a very nice leather-like, mirrored zipper case.  I took it with me on a weekend getaway and it was awesome to have this little carrying case.  It felt very posh.As other reviewers have noted, the instructions that accompany this set are vague, and are written in many languages, which make it extremely hard to find instructions for use.  I'm still not sure I am using the right product at the right time, because the names of the products are so similar - which is which?  One is Extreme Plus Repair, and the second is Extreme Eclat Instant, but I couldn't find instructions with the same names.Both products come in nice silver toned bottles with applicators built in, and with the push of a button at the bottom of the units, product comes out of either a brush applicator or roll style applicator.  I have had to push the buttons several times to get enough product out of the units, so I am suspecting these bottles won't last very long.  Each bottle contains less than one ounce, so obviously there isn't much product in this set.With the unclear instructions, I have been using these products on clean skin every morning.  One of the products made my face feel tighter, which is the same results one gets from using soap.Unfortunately, any impression I had about my skin looking better or lines becoming smaller, was short-lived, as my skin looks exactly the same as before using this product for 7 days.  My pores are the same, and so are my wrinkles.  My skin is soft, but much cheaper products make my skin soft, too.Overall, there is no way I could justify the cost of these products, for less than 2 ounces of product that surely won't last much longer than a week.  As the bottles are silver toned, there's no way to see how much product is left, but I suspect there isn't much.It was a nice trial, but unfortunately, it's back to the Department Store Counter products for me.  At least I can get more quantity for a like price.", "This is a very good product pack that I find is one of the few products that actually work as advertised. Application instructions are easy to understand and are supplied on each product. The product is very easy to use, and offers subtle results. The one thing you don't want to do is use too much product, or you may experience some tingling or irritation, perhaps worse if you are a sensitive skin sufferer. The product itself is not greasy feeling if applied as directed, nor does it leave a sticky residue. As with all skin care products, your own experience may vary greatly.", "\"Having just begun my last year of my 50's, in spite of inheriting my mother's wonderful genes, I have observed more noticeable \"\"smile lines\"\" and wrinkles about my face and neck. (sigh) I guess it was inevitable, even though I've never smoked nor visited a tanning booth. I have been a regular user of \"\"Olay\"\" products and have pretty \"\"normal\"\" skin, never having dealt with acne problems, though it can be sensitive to some products.  This said, I was excited to try this, I think quite expensive, Ainhoa skin care line.  I confess that I had pretty high expectations.It is presented very nicely, the two, shiny chrome cylinders in an oyster-colored, zippered, faux-leather bag.  The cylinders hold 0.68 fluid ounces of product each and have a plunger that you press on the bottom to express a small amount onto the applicator brush or ball, specific to each product.  It looks and feels luxurious.  There is a page of folded instructions and ingredients in the package too, in seven languages. These seemed to me to leave many unanswered questions, such as, \"\"How often do you use it for best results\"\", and \"\"How long do you let it dry before applying makeup?\"\"  The instructions also include information about another product, Extreme Active Repair Cream, (a stem cell re-structuring cream) that isn't included, which seems odd to me.  It actually sounded like the product I would want more than either of the two in this package.I've been using this for a few weeks now, pretty consistently, and I have not noticed any real changes in my skin.  Without adequate directions, I didn't know if I should use it once or twice a day, or how long I should use the \"\"massaging roll-on ball applicator\"\" to \"\"facilitate draining action, permitting increased absorption of the product.\"\"  Even if I used it prior to using the \"\"Extreme Eclat Instant\"\" (which comes with a cool applicator brush), I still didn't notice any change in the appearance of my wrinkles.  Yes, my makeup went on more smoothly, but that was about it.  I have to say, I'm disappointed.I feel that, at best, Ainhoa is a fair moisturizing product in a very pretty package.  I didn't see any results better than the \"\"over-the-counter\"\", much less expensive products I have used through the years.  If you have never used moisturizers before and live in very dry, winter conditions, you would notice a big change, as you would from any moisturizer, but beyond that, I cannot honestly say that it did anything special. I would not purchase it at the near-$100 price, let alone the stated $150 retail.I will continue to use it and will note any additional information if I have it.  I'd love it if my wrinkles suddenly disappeared!\"", "First of all, I could see results after only one application of the repair- amazing!  The skin under my jaw appeared tighter, and the deep line between my brows was far less noticeable.  I especially like the applicators- these are the best.  Big metal-colored tubes with a push-pen type application dispenses just the right amount into the brush or roller.  I love the soft sable brush and is perfect for brushing it on the skin in an even manner.  My face feels like silk, and my makeup glides over the top.  Also comes with a hard-sided travel case, so no worries in the suitcase.  My only caution is to make sure the ends are screwed on well before your first application- one wasn't on tightly on mine, and the end shot off!  It was easily screwed back on, but I should have checked it first.
