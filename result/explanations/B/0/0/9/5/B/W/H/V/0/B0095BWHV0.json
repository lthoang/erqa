"], "reviews": ["This is one of the best mascara products I have ever tried! Not only does it go on smooth, it stays put for the entire day! Also, the shape of the wand is pretty unique and makes it so that I do not have to run the wand along the edge of the tube every time I apply the mascara. I would definitely buy this one again!", "First off I'll be honest that I've never spent more than about $8 or $9 on mascara, so I wondered what would make mascara worth spending over $25 on?  And unfortunately I'm still wondering after usingAINHOA Passion Mascara Volume Upfor the last few weeks.  The brush design is awkward and while it applies the mascara well enough, it doesn't do it any better than other designs.  The texture was a little thick, which I suppose gives you some volume, but if it doesn't go on smooth it just looks clumpy and bad. It washed off easier than waterproof mascara, but just the same as all the others. Overall I can't find any reason why I would pay so much for mascara, that doesn't perform any better than the less expensive ones.", "AINHOA Passion Mascara does the job and does well under water, but it doesn't really stand out among other brands.  The color is rich black that looks rich with great coverage.  Nice soft brush that goes well with a great-looking case, which travels nicely with you wherever you go.", "It's very light. you can barely see that you have mascara on. If you like that look then you will love this. It does add a little volumn but not really dark enough for me.", "I was very pleased with the look and texture of this mascara - vivid colour, and smooth application. It also is easy to remove, though it does not smear or run with use. However, I experienced an allergic reaction including redness and watering, and would caution those who have eye allergies that they may need alternatives to this product.", "\"This mascara doesn't do it for me. It is very clumpy and the twist design of the brush only seems to magnify the problem. There is little else to say other than this: If you are looking for something to enhance your lashes, and something that looks natural, you may want to look elsewhere.Very clumpy and grainy, even after trying to \"\"stir up the contents.\"\" The brush gets loaded down and the design of the brush seems almost nonsensical to me. The twist doesn't do anything at all to improve the way the mascara adheres to your lashes.I will not purchase this product in the future.\"", "This is a great product, with a twisted brush for easy and full application with just one or two swipes, but I did have a slight problem with my eyelashes bunching together more than with other mascaras I've tried. Besides that, though, this mascara doesn't feel weighty or clumpy, and it was easy enough to remove at the end of the day. I have very sensitive eyes, and this one didn't both me at all.", "OMG theres really a difference in this mascara. I love love love this. The brush is shaped differently which worried me for a moment but then I realized why it was useful. It goes on correctly without clumping and lasts all day too. The packaging is attractive and this product already has me addicted! Full lashes with less fuss and I didn't need a sandblaster to get if off my face at night. Enjoy looking beautiful without hurting your eyelashes and skin!", "I don't think I'll ever find the perfect mascara, I gave this one a try and once again was disappointed.  With how much it cost I thought just maybe it would be a better mascara, but it wasn't.  It didn't do much for my lashes, seemed to clump if I put on more then one coat and it dried out and came off throughout the day.  The search for the perfect mascara continues...", "I've never been a woman who cared much for makeup, but there are occasions I feel the need to tone it up a notch. That's when I bring out some mascara -- and over the years, I've tried many different brands. On the whole, no matter what the ads promised, I've failed to see much difference between any of them. Mascara is mascara -- and this one is no different. It does the job well enough, but I don't see anything particularly special about this item to recommend it.", "I go through a lot of mascaras, my eyes are extremely sensitive and I have trouble finding eye products that don't irritate me.  AINHOA is fantastic, it did not irritate the slightest!  Even when I did the ultimate test - sleep in it.  The mascara goes on well with the unique brush and has even distribution and is clump-free. I deducted one star because it didn't have as much lasting power as I would have preferred at this price point.", "It should be noted that when it comes to cosmetics, I'm not a name brand snob. In fact, my makeup bag of favorites includes several $2 products. So splurging on mascara like this is not something I would ordinarily do. My typical mascara isMaybelline Great Lash Mascara, Soft Black- .43 Fluid Ounce, which costs about $5, or one-fifth the price of this Ainhoa Passion. Getting me to shell out that much more money would require some spectacular results. So how did the Ainhoa Passion fare in terms of my sky-high expectations?The Packaging: Right out of the Amazon mailer, it was obvious Ainhoa aims to appeal to the aesthetic senses. Cased in a shimmering dark blue box, the mascara itself comes in a metallic silver tube. A nice bonus, but not something that justifies the elevated cost.The Brush: The brush is interesting. There's an indentation that runs all the way around it about one-quarter of the way down. Even now, after using the product for a week, I'm not sure what the purpose of this groove is. On the plus side, the mascara comes out of the tube without any globs. At no point have I had to scrape excess product off the brush onto the side of the tube, which I often have to do with my Maybelline Great Lash.The Application: I already have long lashes, so I need volume more than length. In fact, my Maybelline mascara often smears on my eyelid immediately after application because of the length of my lashes. That aggravating tendency did not happen with the Ainhoa. It went on silky smooth, with no clumps and no smudging. All of my lashes were separated without having to comb through them. I liked that. Another positive is that it goes on my lower lashes, which can be tricky, just as smoothly.The Durability: This product held up rather well throughout the day, even after rubbing my eyes. This surprised me. Since this mascara felt so lightweight, I thought for sure it must have worn away. I had absolutely no flaking or raccoon eyes while wearing this product and it comes off easily with soap and water. I've also noticed that my lashes aren't quite as dry upon removal, almost as if the Ainhoa is conditioning them.Bottom Line: This is a quality product, but I use mascara to add volume and visual impact to my lashes. Cheaper products provide me with both of these aims. I don't mind combing out a few clumps or wiping away a few smudges when the savings is $20 every time I need a new tube. The conditioning aspect has potential, however, so if this product were in the $12 to $15 price range, I might consider giving up my spendthrift ways for it.", "PROS: I liked the way my lashes looked. It does make them look longer and fuller. The mascara went on smooth. I had no problems with clumps.CONS: I did end up getting mascara on my eyelids while I was putting it on. I hate that.4 STARS: I did like the effect but I wasn't blown away. I prefer to use Loreal Double Extend. No clumps and no issues with mascara on my eyelids.", "I really like this mascara!The wand is thin enough that I don't get mascara all over my upper lid, but it's thick enough at the same time.  It goes on evenly and smoothly and doesn't smudge or run all day!  Easily washes off at night with simple soap and water.  I have such a hard time finding a decent mascara - most of the time, the wands are too thick and I end up with it all over the place, or it goes on clumpy.  Not with this one.  Love it!", "\"I recently ordered this mascara for my wife.  Here is her review:\"\"One of the best mascaras I have ever used.  Manages to be natural looking and glamorous at the same time.  Did not irritate my sensitive eyes.  Very easy to wash off with Cetaphil.  Don't even need to curl my eyelashes with it!\"\"\"", "Normally when I wear mascara, I spend the day with irritated eyes and the next day I lose several eye lashes.  I cannot tolerate the waterproof mascara at all and so I normally end up with dark smudges under my eyes by the end of the day.  This mascara goes on lightly. Look closely at the picture and you will see that the brush is a little different with longer bristles on the ends and shorter in the middle.  The mascara applied evenly and stayed on with no dark smudges at the end of the day.  I also had no irritation.  When it was time to wash my face for bed, I had completely forgotten I had any mascara on.  I am very happy with this mascara and recommend it to anyone with sensitive eyes like mine.", "\"The Passion Volume Up Mascara is the first Ainhoa product I have ever tried. I'm extremely impressed. The color is very rich and dark, and lends a gorgeous dramatic effect instantly. I didn't have any problem with \"\"spiky\"\" eyelashes.The makeup separates the eyelashes very well, although the mascara itself clumps toward the base of the eyelash. If you aren't careful, you'll end up with tiny little clusters in your eye.Overall, I love the look Ainhoa gives. This truly is a pretty mascara that makes your lashes look longer, fuller, and darker instantly. Definitely recommended.\"", "I have been loyally using Almay Pure Blends Mascara for about 2 years... but it gets dry and crumbly, largely because I don't take care of my makeup the way I should (i.e. it sits in the car, so for a quarter of the year things get frozen and another quarter, they overheat).I also wear hard contact lenses - combined with mascara, this can be rough on the eyes.THIS STUFF IS AMAZING. Goes on buttery-smooth, light (the Almay stuff is, at best, thick and clumpy, even when body-temperature. Anything colder than body temp and it's too crumbly), perfect, easy to apply even on lower lashes. The shape of the brush is perfect, and it's a high-quality one. The mascara stays throughout the day without feeling crusty or irritating my eyes - and it washes off fairly easily. No need for eye makeup remover - my regular face wash was enough to remove it.Having gotten this through Vine, I was hopeful of purchasing more... and then I saw the price and almost fell over. No wonder it's so great. I guess I'll have to try a few more brands. But in the meantime, will I be keeping this in my car? No.", "For the record, I've never used mascara in my life and have no intention of doing so. However, my wife wanted me to order this AINHOA Passion Mascara through Vine, so I got it for her. Here's what she said about it:* The brush is nicely shaped and it's stored in a cute silver bottle* It's not messy or clumpy when the wand is pulled out of the tube* It goes on easy and has good volume, but it flakes off by the end of the workday"], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.060572549700737, 0.05131985992193222, 0.04994625598192215, 0.05597695708274841, 0.05621960386633873, 0.05011942610144615, 0.05811378359794617, 0.060106270015239716, 0.05201594904065132, 0.053120508790016174, 0.0480329655110836, 0.04657984897494316, 0.05109643563628197, 0.05242450162768364, 0.055168334394693375, 0.05334552749991417, 0.03981151431798935, 0.05849462002515793, 0.04753510281443596]]}
