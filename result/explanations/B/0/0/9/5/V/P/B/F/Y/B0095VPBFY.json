I can play 1080P Videos just fine with it. No complaints runs nice and cool.", "Let's face it.  Intel has beaten AMD by mile the last few years in processor performance.  Nothing can touch the I7 series for sure processing power.  You also pay a premium for them.  Most people don't take advantage of this raw computing power unless you are doing video editing, Digital Audio work or heavy gaming type applications.  The typical person uses their computer for e-mail, word processing and internet browsing.  If that is you - why not save some money and buy this processor.I was looking for a low cost machine to store and access over 1000 albums I had ripped to FLAC files.  I wanted it all on a single hard drive so I could access my music quickly at home without having to search through all my CD's.  I purchased this processor as part of DIY machine build.  The cost was incredibly inexpensive and I didn't need a ton of computing power for this task.  I had recently built a computer for a neighbor using the A4 version and was quite impressed with how it performed.  This processor was just a step up from the A4 with a little faster clock speed.My machine ended up becoming more than just an audio server as I recently dumped my cable bill for streaming video content from the internet.  This PC is connected to a very good outboard DAC via a USB connection for audio and I also have it connected to my 54 inch Plasma HD TV via an HDMI connection. (Just using the built in video processor of this APU)This dual core APU doesn't miss a beat.  I'm running windows 8.1 and it handles everything I throw at it.  I never overclocked it and it handles audio as well as video serving tasks with finese.  In fact, it does it's job much better than I ever thought it would.  I never see any lag on HD video output. The video processor built into this is not state of the art by today's standards, but quite capable for light-medium gaming and HD video streaming.  A few years ago no one would have ever believed you could have built a video processor like this into a processor chip.  AMD certainly has Intel beat in this area. What that means for you is BANG FOR THE BUCK!This APU runs on very little power and therefore doesn't require a lot of cooling.  I don't even hear my stock CPU fan running.  I would highly recommend this processor for a Home video/audio server application like I am using it for or for  typical computing tasks.  As others have stated, putting in faster RAM does benefit this processor.  I'm using slower RAM than it's capable of handling and it is still very impressive.This processor certainly wouldn't be a choice for my Digital Audio Workstation, but let's be fair here.  AMD never intended this APU line to be competitive for these kinds of applications.AMD may not have the fastest processors on the market, but they have the best bang for the buck for the majority of users. (Running typical applications)I think some people go overboard and purchase the A8 or A10 and then find they have to spend more money dealing with the heat, bigger power supplies, etc.  I'm not knocking the A8 or A10 - but for my application it is overkill and I wouldn't have been able to build a machine as cheaply as I did with the A6.  There's something to be said about the A6 and the ability to build a low cost machine that uses very little power, stays cool and does most tasks extremely well.AMD built a winner with this APU line.  The A6 is a very capable processor for the typical application user.  Highly recommended.", "Overall not bad, very easy to overclock to 4.1.  Playing games online like RuneScape puts some strain on it because of the high level of detail and rendering. Not too bad for what i'm using it for, but if you plan on doing any more I would advise getting a dedicated graphics card.", "From what I have seen on YouTube, this chip holds up pretty well for gaming. Too bad both my Motherboard & my PSU was DOA.", "This is the &#34;Trinity&#34; version from AMD of their Accelerated Processor Unit architecture. For all of my clients that have custom systems from me, they are quite happy with these. For everyday basic stuff, like email, facebook, internet, etc., they work fine. If you need more raw processing power, like video and photo editing, you definitely should look at Intel's new Haswell architecture. But for those on a budget, this APU, paired with a Gigabyte A85X chipset motherboard...well you have a fine system. You can even play games on this without the need for a discrete graphics card (assuming low to medium settings depending on the game). It then becomes really easy later to add a Radeon graphics card from AMD if you want. With this APU, keep in mind it performs even better if you use faster RAM. I wouldn't recommend RAM any higher than DDR3-1600, because of reliability. Speeds above that are not as reliable.", "i just wanted to say thanks for the cpu i think i have a board for it but the case i have is an old ratty one think i get another one happy new year bud have a good one", "This isn't a quad-core APU, so it's lacking for games that need that, but it has a HIGH cpu speed (3.6 that can be OCed to 3.8) and it's easily overclockable. AMD is know for heat though, so an after-market cooler will be nice for that, but the good thing is that with all AMD motherboards, the socket can hold anything.", "I love this cheap CPU.  I used it to upgrade an old single core and wow.  Its actually faster than my gaming rig (phenom 2 1045 six core) at watching youtube videos.  I tagged it with 6670 GPU and it seems to upgrade the video WIN EX numbers.  I can play the new tombraider at lower levels just as an experiment.  I set this up for the wife and she couldnt be happier.  If doing video gaming this is not really the CPU for you.  A four core that will crossfire with a GPU would work much better, but for general computing and serfing the web, its really quick.", "works for my needs nicely.  I wanted to build a PC for my basement to act as home theater PC.  Does the job.  Powers 2 27in LCDs.  I use sling to watch various games on them and stream movies etc.  Nice to have GPU saved me some $.  I was able to overclock it and runs solid.
