Main complaint you'll hear from anyone that listens to it for the first time: &#34;Sure sounds like there's only one speaker in there&#34;.  That translates into literally no stereo separation at all.  Now if there was a way to rig up 4 of these in each corner of the room all playing in parallel then cool.  But you won't.It sounds just ok, although it does have good (not filling-shattering) volume, and a good bass response.  For $600 you can find LOTS of other units (like the HK Soundbars and others) that do a 3x better job.  The BT on the Bose is antiquated, problematic, an separate add-on and expensive.  It hangs up often requiring reboots or power cycles.  It powers down after 30 mins or so, and the only way to turn it back on is with the remote (there's NO switch on the unit).  Reconnecting BT from your phone etc will NOT automatically turn the unit back on - you'll be scrambling to find the remote.  Typical Bose behind-the power curve stuff.But it's an elegant unit, and very well made.  The new Bose units that replaced this one aren't much better in sound quality.  B&O; and HK leave Bose way back a distant 3rd.  Oh - I'd get 2 remotes because there's no other way to control this thing without it", "\"The Bose SoundDock 10, simply put, is the absolute best audio reproduction device I have ever owned.  I have had numerous high grade stereos, internet radios, and other audio equipment.  For pure sound reproduction, none really compare to the SoundDock.This is not an inexpensive product, but it does fall into the class of \"\"You get what you pay for.\"\"  The SoundDock comes with a remote, which is every bit as high quality as the dock itself.  It also includes an AC adapter, auxiliary cable, and a Blue Tooth dock, which can be installed/removed depending on if you want to dock an iPod or play wirelessly.The design of the SoundDock is modernistic - very sleek with rounded edges and a curved front.  The finish is a soft silver, except for the dock base and top of the unit, which are black.  The minimalist approach continues with no actual buttons on the device and just a pale device icon.  The only other light is a BlueTooth symbol on the Bluetooth adapter.The rear of the unit has the AC adapter port, as well as an Aux In (to connect non-Bluetooh devices) and a Video Out, so you can play video from your paired smartphone on a TV.  There is also a USB port to install firmware updates.  Because there are no controls on the SoundDock itself, all of the fuctions are controlled by the included full feature remote, in combination with your paired device.  The remote is lightweight, but make no mistake - it handles every feature you need from power, to volume, to basic \"\"iPod\"\" functions, like play lists, forward, rewind, etc.At 17 w x 9.6 h 8.7 d and about 18.5 pounds, the SoundDock is not a small unit.  However, it is not imposing either, especially since the speakers and subwoofer are all internal, so like many Bose products, there's no need for wires, speaker placement, etc.The sound reproduction on this product is extremely lifelike.  Songs you've heard a thousand times suddenly have nuances and depth you never before noticed - or even heard. You listen to the music you are streaming, and the quality really sounds like \"\"you are there.\"\"  The bass is clear and deep, the midranges wonderful, and the highs very crisp.  Even at higher volume levels, the sound remains undistorted and lifelike.  Listening to music, you can really hear the separation of vocals, finger work on a guitar, the resonance of a tom tom, and the ping on the cup of a cymbal. As I write this review,  I was listening to an old song on the SoundDock.  The song has a whistle in the background, and it caused me to look over my shoulder as if someone in the room had whistled.Two annoyances to note:1.  As of right now, the device does not  dock an iPhone 5.  The dock accepts Apple's 30 pin connector, not the new Lightning interface found on the iPhone 5.  Bose has announced plans to release a Lightning dock device, and you can presently buy a 30 pin to Lightning adapter.2. The dock itself is not always easy to remove.  I tend to switch back and forth between streaming music from an iPad tablet, and charging/docking an iPod.  This requires switching back and forth from the dock to the Bluetooth adapter.  The Bluetooth adapter itself removes easily, with the touch of a button.  However, the fascia which surrounds the dock is a pain to remove.  Bose advises using a non-metallic object (I use a plastic knife) to slide into the slot on the dock fascia to remove it.  It seems like this could have been easier, especially coming from Bose, where quality and design are generally superior.Overall, the sound of the SoundDock is so incredible, these flaws become trivial, because the SoundDock is simply astounding.  While there are many other music systems out there, most for a lower price.....for the discerning ear or someone who wants the best there is - this may be it.\"", "As most people know, Bose has its own sound and this dock is no different.  Bose is great at squeezing decent quality sound out of a small and nicely designed package.This dock is definitely quite powerful and can be cranked up without distortion.  As with most speaker docks, it needs to be situated near a wall for greatest effect - putting it on an open table or outside will make the sound seem weak.  Place it correctly and it sounds 10x better.The dock connector is a modular design, which can be swapped out for the bluetooth module.  It's a nice upgrade, but I wish the bluetooth would have just been built in to begin with.  Swapping the docks out is a real pain - they fit so tightly I literally needed a screwdriver to get enough leverage to pop out the ipod dock.  While this might be a good design for future expansion (I could see a lightning connector or mini/micro usb), it stinks how hard it is to use.  It also makes you choose between charging vs. bluetooth.I haven't found the need to try the video out feature, though this might be usefull in situations where you need to conserve space.  Given that it's just a composite-out, though, it doesn't lend itself well to the HD video that the iPhone/iPods are capable of storing and playing.Overall, a good sounding unit (though not necessarily worth the premium, imo) that has the capability to be future-proof (if Bose decides to make additional docks).  The problem here is that Bose hasn't released any other modules, so paying that premium now is still a risk.  No HD video out, no USB charging/docking option for other devices, and uncertainty in additional modules to be released make me feel like the price is only justifiable for someone who exclusively uses blutooth.  Paying this much of a premium for better sound quality, only to stream music via bluetooth seems like a contradiction in motives.  Therefore, I struggle to recommend this product as of the time of this writing.  It does everything it advertises, the question is really - is that everything you need?", "I received my Bose SoundDock 10 a couple of hours ago and have been playing with it ever since.  I was surprised when Fedex delivered the box, because its heavy.  I looked at the product listing on Amazon and it says 22.5 pounds!  I agree with that.  Anyway, getting back to unboxing and setting this up.  That took about 2 minutes, only because I was trying to be careful.  I read through the instructions, another 2 minutes.  The instructions are very simple and I am sure I could have easily figured everything out without them.  The system is very intuitive.Ok, looks.  It is a great looking system and will blend in well in my house.But lets get to the important part, sound.  The sound is incredible!  I placed this Bose unit in a decent sized room, 25 by 43 feet, and it sounds great at many different volume levels.  Even at the lower volume I can still hear it clearly across the room.  Pretty amazing.Now I am by no means an audiophile, but I can usually tell when something sounds crisp and clear and better than normal.  This unit is incredibly crisp and clear, even at higher volumes than I would normally listen to it.  I know that because my 7 year old son picked up the remote and turned the volume to max, which makes sense because his name is Max.  Ok, stupid joke, but that is his name and it is what he does.  But even with the music blasting, it was still crisp and clear.The system has a video output and aux input for using this with other pieces of equipment.  I tried the video output using my son's IPOD and we listened to the audio on the Bose unit and watched the video on our projection screen.  The sound is as good as our older model home theater system with six speakers surrounding the room.  I think the Bose unit may become our new home theater speaker system.I could not be happier with this unit.  I have a few other Bose speaker units and I have always been impressed with their quality.  I think this one steps that quality up another notch.", "The SoundDock 10 is truly exceptional. Great bass, midrange and highs - in a way where everything is balanced.There is no need to physically dock an Apple device as the Bluetooth dock works perfectly, has incredible range and delivers ultra-clean, full-range sound (unless you want to watch video stored on your Apple device, I'm not sure if video is transmitted via Bluetooth).The ONLY reason I am giving this 4 stars is that $540 seems somewhat high to me. I get the whole thing where you're buying a patented design, great engineering and workmanship (although the CD player in my Wave II Music System broke shortly after the warranty had lapsed), but I almost didn't buy this thing because I feel it is priced $50 - $100 too high.That said, I will keep it. As the SoundDock 10 is a solid-state product, I don't expect anything to break (as the CD player did in my Wave II Music System). If you're okay with the asking price (I'm not quite 100% comfortable with the price) you will love this thing.", "I own the Bose Soundlink Bluetooth Wireless Model and really enjoy it, so I wanted to try this Bose 10 to see what I could get from a larger speaker. I find they both sound great with the EQ off or on flat. They both sound equally clear even when I go into other rooms of the house. This Bose 10 is capable of filling a large area with music and has a lot better bass, I tried it on multiple surfaces and placement and found it sounds best placed on my hardwood floor, the bass just feels better that way. I find no distortion at all levels of comfortable volume, for some people they find the sound almost muffled, this can be a +/-, as I like no high piercing sounds, I like it this way.  The max volume on my device is never the same, as when using the remote, you'll need the remote.This Bose 10 is a lot heftier then my Bose Soundlink, not really made for moving it around I enjoy both, the Soundlink is portable and has internal battery for many hours of music unplugged, but the Bose 10 has the capability of more volume and bass.", "I have owned the Bose Soundlink Bluetooth Wireless for two years now and love it.  I really was curious about how much more sound I could get from the Bose 10.  Wow.  I was really impressed.My home is more of the open plan concept with Cathedral ceilings.  I placed the Bose 10 on an elevated shelf and was blown away with how the sound filled the entire house at even a moderate level of volume.I am not an audiophile by any means.  I am really just about convenience. My Iphone 4 is the only MP3 player I own so I don't deal with the dock issues others have who use an Ipod.  I have a Denon Home Theater system my husband set up years ago so I haven't taken advantage of any of the input/outputs but I am thinking I am going to get someone to help me hook up the TV and DVR and DVD to the Bose and get rid of the bulky Denon equipment.There is one thing I would like to see changed on this SoundDock.  Because of its weight, one isn't going to be moving it around a lot.  I would love to see it on a swivel base so that I could direct the sound towards a different part of the house if I wanted.The cost is quite the splurge.  But....it's a BOSE!  I can't think of any comparable product that costs less except for maybe a JawBone.  I would be really interested to read a comparison of the Jawbone and the Bose 10.Bottom line:  If you can afford it and you will take advantage of all the technology it offers, then you can't go wrong with the Bose 10.", "We've been loving the SoundDock and the exceptional sound you expect from Bose.Bose has adapted well through the years.  From my earliest memory of that little radio with a big sound, then CD players, entertainment systems including DVD and more.  With digital music becoming the standard, Bose has adjusted to our lifestyles.To think you can just pop your iPod (or other 30 pin device) to the unit and fill your home with crisp clear sound is just impressive.  Of course, soon it will be time to switch from 30 pin to Lightning, and then something else. But that's what adapters are for.I also highly recommend the SoundDock 10 for those with limited space.  A great addition to a smaller apartment, but still powerful enough to fill a house with party quality sound.Setup, hookup and connection was very simple, and the bluetooth merely opens up the possibilities as to where the sound source comes from.Not exactly the most portable, but compared to a huge boombox on your shoulder, you are good to go wherever music is needed.", "What can I say - it's a Bose!  There is no doubt that they make some of the highest quality speakers around, and this sounddock is no exception.  Build quality is first rate all the way around - it is quite a bit heavier than I expected it would be.  Sound is pure and crisp and gets plenty loud enough to rock the house - it sounds better than my Sony home stereo, which is way bigger and not at all portable. Being bluetooth connected, it so easy to just plug it into whatever room you want music and start playing.  Initially, bluetooth setup was a little bit tricky, but after a few tries I did get it connected - I think maybe I didn't have the bluetooth adapter seated in all the way. Which brings me to another point, it comes with the Ipod/Iphone dock adapter plugged in by default, and you have to remove it and plug in the bluetooh adapter to use the bluetooth. Not quite what I expected, but no biggie, since you really only have to do this once.  Sound is amazing, and you would absolutely never guess that it was playing from a phone or tablet thru a single speaker system. Using via bluetooth I experienced no skips or static and it sounded incredible.  If you want a high quality home audio solution to connect to your phone or tablet, then absolutely this is the one to get.  I also have the portable battery operated Soundlink speaker, but I think that audio thru this one sounds just a little bit truer - and the volume on this goes up louder than the soundlink.  I can't believe the sound that they can pack into a relatively small speaker package these days!", "Bose makes quality products. I have tried two of their speakers and their headphones and have experienced excellent sound from these well-constructed products. My previous speaker was also a bluetooth speaker, their portable version.This speaker has a 30 pin connecter dock (so not compatible with iPhone 5) as well as bluetooth connectivity (switching between the two is kind of annoying). It can pair up with several devices (I want to say 6, but can't remember for sure). Pairing is fairly simple, though we have had some problems with competing devices confusing both us and the speaker.The speaker comes with a remote, but if you are using bluetooth you can simply use your device to manage the music. I paired it with my iPhone and then put it in my pocket and used it to skip songs and such. Then I kept walking out of range and hearing my music fade out :)This speaker is very large and heavy. Once it was set up I didn't want to move it. It can be moved by one person, but with such an expensive speaker you might want to be more careful and have someone help you.I continue to love Bose products, but I can never say if I would really pay that much for a speaker. $600 is a nice chunk of cash. But if sound and quality are really important to you, then Bose is the way to go.", "This system is really fantastic. The sound that comes out of this unit is clear and makes losssy aac and mp3 files sound lossless. It definitely lives up to the name that Bose has made for themselves in terms of sound quality.  It streams music from Pandora or Spotify, as well as playing music from your iPod or iPhone. It has become our main music player for the house. I haven't tried yet with any other type of device, but the new lightning adapter from Apple does work well.", "I have a lot of different sound systems including Bose headphones and a little Bose SoundDockII table speaker/charger. The little SoundDockII is great  for voice and background music. For listening while mowing the lawn or air travel the noise cancelling head phones are  best.  The SoundDock 10 is for listening to music  when you want a more  powerful sound. You can take it to  very room filling levels or hear it well in several rooms. You can't shake the walls or feel it in your chest like a  500 watt receiver with a sub woofer but you can disturb the neighbors, but to the listener  it has a smooth clean sound. What I am saying is that it work best when turned up loud,but you don't have to. When turned down low it is less resonant. I placed it on the floor which enables it to resonate better with the environment.I don't get what people are talking about when they say it is does not have built in Bluetooth. You simply slip in the provided module and forget the sound dock/charger. If you want to use it as a charger you could change it back. For I phone 5 you would need an adapter but I just pair all my devices with the Bluetooth.", "\"We bought this from a warehouse store since it was on sale and we're really happy with it. The sound is a little heavy on the bass but it works well for music. It's typical Bose sound which is great for rock/pop music but not really the best for voice/news. It does work with voice well enough that you can listen to the news but that's not really what it's designed for.I may look for a  better location, right now it's in the corner of a planter window behind our sink on the counter top, and that corner location is probably making the bass boom a bit too much. Be aware that it's not splash/water proof, so if you're considering putting it in a kitchen or bathroom then make sure it's not going to get wet.Pairing is very easy. Hold down the Bluetooth button on the speaker for 5 or so seconds (when the BT module is installed) and then scan Bluetooth devices with your phone. No code to enter! It's easy!We have it currently paired with 2 Android phones and have sent streaming Internet music (SiriusXM) and locally stored MP3s to the speaker. Switching between the phones is easy and reliable (turn off bluetooth or disconnect the BT session on the connected phone to allow the other phone to connect). You don't need to re-pair each time you switch devices, just \"\"connect\"\" from the BT menu on your device.The speaker is powered by a direct AC connection, so there's no power brick taking up extra space like some of the portable speaker options. There is no battery power for this speaker, it's not a portable speaker. This is a fairly large speaker (better sound!) and not light, so check dimensions and weight to make sure it fits in your intended location of use.The included remote uses a lithium button-cell battery (included) and is basic, controlling power, volume, track forward/backward, playlist forward/backward and input (aux or Bluetooth/ipod). It has good range and doesn't require pointing the remote at the speaker.The front of the speaker has a modular connector, so you can either connect via Bluetooth, or remove that module and insert the ipod/iphone docking port. You can't have both at the same time. If you have both Apple and Android just use streaming for both, but you won't be charging your iDevice.Update March 15 2014: I've also paired it with my iPod 5th gen running 7.1 and there are no problems, the sound is good. There is 1 drawback we've discovered but there's a sort of work around for it. You can't do much without the remote control. It doesn't auto turn on the speaker when streaming starts to it (bluetooth) and you still need the volume adjustment for the speaker from the remote since the volume adjustment from your bluetooth device doesn't seem to control the master volume, just your devices output volume. The workaround for the auto turn on is to press the bluetooth button for a second. Not long enough to trigger pairing, but to turn on the speaker. However you still need to remote to turn it off and adjust the volume. It's too bad Bose didn't include a few basic buttons on the speaker and/or a place the store the remote so it doesn't get lost. Still a good speaker, but it could have been better.Update March 28 2014: One more item to add to this. I've paired my laptop to this speaker too so I can listen to the audio from mp3s, SiriusXM web and other sources. It's nothing groundbreaking and you'd actually expect it to work. It was easy and painless to do. I'm using a Windows 7 64bit Home Pro version on an older Lenovo X220t laptop (with Bluetooth). Windows recognized the speaker installed the drivers and was ready to go. Press the connect button and start playing your audio through this. I expect modern Macs would do the same too, although I haven't tried yet.\"", "Brace yourself! I am a die-hard Bose fan! I have a very respect for Bose products (American made!). I love their quality and superior marksmanship. Bose is to sound as Apple is to phone/tablet.So, it should come as no surprise to you that this review is high. This SoundDock is another in the series of exceptional products that Bose makes. Light, portable, outstanding quality, superb sound.The only negative remark would be to improve the way one can switch from an iPhone docking to the Bluetooth transmitter. It took a little prodding to get the dock out. That's the only negative part. That and the fact that it doesn't come with an iPhone 5 adapter at the time of this review (October, 2012).If you are looking for a perfect gift this season, look no further. You will be the star of the party with this device.Highly recommended!", "\"This will just be a summary of things I've discovered while using this BOSE SoundDock 10 Bluetooth digital music system (what a mouthful).First, the Bluetooth is not built in. This is due to BOSE originally selling the SoundDock 10 without the Bluetooth adapter, - it was an additional purchase. Since then, BOSE now bundles the Bluetooth adapter in with the dock. What this means is that by default you receive this system with the iPhone/iPod touch dock installed at the front of the unit, but if you want to use Bluetooth you have to remove this and then install the Bluetooth dock.That said, perhaps due to the external Bluetooth antenna, the range is quite excellent. I was able to go several rooms away with my iPhone 5 and still maintain a solid connection, with music playing happily.So, to break it down:Pros:1.) Very attractive, smart, upscale looking device.2.) Extremely simple to pair your Bluetooth device with the dock.3.) Very large sound, with no distortion even at the upper db levels. Bass is controlled, and voices sound incredibly crisp.4.) Pairs with my iPhone and iPad instantly as soon as I turn either the BOSE SoundDock on or my iPhone or iPad's Bluetooth on.5.) Excellent remote. This cannot be overstated. Many music docks like this use extremely cheap infrared remotes, that you have to point RIGHT at the unit to make it respond. The SoundDock has an extremely strong IR transmitter/receiver. I can bounce the remote signal off walls etc, and the SoundDock responds every time. Really great stuff. I love this.6.) You can pause/play/change volume/skip track even when you're using your device over Bluetooth. I can't speak for all Bluetooth devices, but my iPhone 5 works perfectly with all those functions working great.7.) Only one visible LED when the unit is off, - a small, white one. THANK you BOSE for not putting an eye-piercing blue one on there. My SoundDock lives in my bedroom and the last thing I need is some other obnoxious LED in a world full of too many as it is!Cons:1.) Quite expensive. I mean really, - it's expensive!2.) The sound, while excellent, may be a tad \"\"bright\"\" to some people. BOSE really likes to push those upper registers at times, something I noticed on the BOSE SoundLink speaker system. This is definitely a treble-happy speaker, though bass levels really are good.3.) Having to switch out the iPod dock for the Bluetooth dock seems a little... dated, despite the strong signal strength over Bluetooth.4.) No compatibility with the iPhone 5 in the iPod dock for now, due to the iPhone 5's new Lightning interface. A call to BOSE had them confirm to me that the Apple Lightning -> 30-pin adapter WILL work with the SoundDock 10, so if docking your iPhone 5 is a necessity, you'll need to fork out another $29 (at the current time) for this.5.) If you get the Lightning -> 30-pin adapter, there's a danger of breaking the BOSE dock connector if you're not careful, due to the added height the Apple adapter making the whole thing a tad... precarious. We hope BOSE puts out a Lightning dock soon.6.) No AirPlay. Seriously, why is there no AirPlay support?7.) A bit of a bear to remove the iPod dock plastic insert before inserting the Bluetooth dock.8.) No equalizer settings of any sort.Overall, this really is a nice speaker system. While not perfect (some things really should have been integrated), it puts out a really nice sound, can fill a medium-to-large room easily, and has BOSE's excellent support behind it. You can't really go wrong.4.5 stars out of 5.*EDIT June 1, 2013*Still really, really enjoying this dock. It puts out such a nice, crisp sound. The remotes (I picked up an extra one because I love it so much and like to have several around the room) still work excellently.I mentioned earlier I love the remotes, and I discovered one other neat thing about them: The buttons are sealed, so you can't get any dirt in them or ruin them somehow. BOSE covered the entire face in this soft-touch material, sealing the buttons underneath. So you can take a wet paper towel and clean the buttons up without any fear of getting liquid into the remote. And because it's soft touch, it's pretty much impossible to scratch up the front of the remote. (The back is plastic, though.)I'm now using the dock with an Apple Airport Express, too. I have the Airpot Express connected via a 3.5mm cable to the AUX-in on the BOSE SoundDock 10, and have been very, very happy with this setup, too. Now I can play music from iTunes via WiFi to the Airport Express -> SoundDock via AirPlay.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03165189549326897, 0.019023068249225616, 0.0003132234560325742, 0.0017086031148210168, 0.002888952847570181, 0.004150811117142439, 0.06356480717658997, 0.003335690125823021, 0.0052460008300840855, 0.01016366109251976, 0.41373759508132935, 0.0037606069818139076, 0.0007360878516919911, 0.022910771891474724, 0.41680824756622314]]}
