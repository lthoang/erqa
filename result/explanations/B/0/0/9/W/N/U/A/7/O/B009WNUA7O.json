They are light and sound great.  don't expect sound quality like a $300 pair but for what I paid, they are well worth it.", "Classy looking and sounding Jlab delivers the audio goods again.  I'm not a serious audiophile, but these things sound absolutely great to me.", "...but they sound like crap.I am not terribly demanding of my headphones, but this particular pair does not make the grade. No bass to speak of, highs are not there, everything else is tinny.But my 12-year-old thinks they're the shizznits, so...four stars.", "I purchased to Black/Gunmetal Bombora's directly from Jlab. I expected a good product. I was not expecting them to WOW me, but they did!  Right away I could tell that the quality of materials used are very good.  The fit and finish are great!  I warmed them up for a few minutes with Thievery Corporation's Mirror Conspiracy and my preliminary assessment is that these are going to get a lot of use from me.  I like what I'm hearing so far.  Right now they're plugged into a computer using Jlab's burn-in utility on their website. However, while I do expect them to get even better after burn-in, they're great right out of the box.  Bravo, Jlab.", "I bought a pair of these for myself and enjoyed the rich bass. My son wanted one after wearing mine so I purchased one for him as well.Note though that the ear pads for my son's set broke apart exposing the blue greenish foam under it just after a week of slight use. I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement and the replacement took a week to get here. Again my son complained after two weeks that the foam was showing again. I think the ear pads are defective. JLab needs to look into this. Now I need some replacement ear pads. I don't want to have to send them back since my son is attached to them.", "Ok, these sound great, but I need a 15 foot extension to use them in my living room with my home theater system.  I've tried one very cheap cord, and one moderately priced cord, and both had shorts out of the box, that made the headphones sound awful.  Be sure to take out any extension cords, and test the headphones directly, before you think a sound problem is the headphones themselves.  Does anyone have a good 10 or 15 dollar headphone extension cord that actually doesn't mess with the sound quality.", "No doubt that these headsets sound very good.  Not exceptional, but very good.  Part of the reason they sound good is the great fit helps seal out sounds from the environment around you.  They do look good, but are larger than they appear in the stock photo.  I had gotten the impression that they were more streamlined than they are, but they are definitely on the large side of over-the-ear headphones.  Considering all of this, I would give this headset four stars.  The additional knock on stars comes from what seems to be a design flaw.  The headphone cord has a fabric coating.  Seems like a nice touch.  All seemed well until I wore these headphones with a winter jacket.  The cord between the volume controller and the headphone naturally rubbed against the bulky coat.  This resulted in a loud scratching noise in the left speaker. To test this, I ran my hand up and down the cord (just a light touch), and sure enough, this results in a very noticeable scratching/abrasive noise that gets louder as you get closer to the headset.  It's as if the additional friction from the fabric coating, even from a light touch, is being amplified into the left speaker.  So, now that I've noticed the distortion, I'm hearing it all the time, winter coat or not.  Maybe others can provide feedback on whether or not they have the same issue.  If no one else is having this issue, maybe I got a bad pair?  If that's the case, I would be happy to switch them out and update my review, as the sound is very good and the headphones are very comfortable.  But for now, I cannot recommend.", "\"Heed my advice, I really don't know what everyone is talking about when they say the quality is \"\"GREAT,\"\" the only thing I can think of is they don't know what good or great headphones really sound like.I really don't think my pair is \"\"defective\"\" because they work fine... I'm just doing comparisons here.I bought these because I did some research for \"\"comfortable\"\" headphones that will fit my large ears.  These fit the bill and I must say they are really really comfortable compared to the other 4 phones I own and way more comfortable than wearing earbuds.That being said the sound quality is just atrocious.  I have a pair of Sony studio phones that are nearly 10 years old that I didn't think cost so much back then but I see top places use the same ones, radio stations, production studios, etc.  I can't even remember how I could afford phones like that, but I did somehow.  Anyway, using those Sony's for so long, I realized I didn't want to have them to carry around with me all the time and break them so I bought these Bombora's to replace them on the road.And I must say I kind of want to use the Sony's and risk breaking them as opposed to using the Bombora's... there's simply bad karma in these phones they sound that bad... and I really feel like I'll end up hating the music I listen to because they make them sound so poor.I even have a Y splitter to plug in two headphones at once, doing a side by side comparison with Sony's and Bombora's, it's like BMW vs KIA...The new KIA's look like BMW's, but they ain't BMW's.It's also comparable to driving in my car with a decked out JBL sound system for so long, then taking a ride in my mom's minivan with stock speakers and wishing I was back in my own car.  That's exactly what I feel like with the Bombora's vs. the Sony phones I have, and in the same topic.Hope this helped.\"", "Bought these after my other AP true fidelity ones broke because of their flimsy components. These don't match the sound quality, but I will try for another day before I decide if I want them or not."], "Gamma": [0.35190796852111816, 0.27732643485069275, 0.3707655966281891], "Beta": [[0.0028928217943757772, 0.20681500434875488, 0.10183482617139816, 0.32184553146362305, 0.009678748436272144, 0.00017094402574002743, 0.3244877755641937, 0.029237674549221992, 0.003036594484001398], [0.002314083743840456, 0.22005701065063477, 0.09929721057415009, 0.3218245804309845, 0.008433423936367035, 0.00046015187399461865, 0.31995418667793274, 0.02534424141049385, 0.0023151200730353594], [0.0031449657399207354, 0.2019132673740387, 0.10274802148342133, 0.32166510820388794, 0.010188637301325798, 0.00011761110363295302, 0.3260226249694824, 0.030838117003440857, 0.0033616276923567057]]}
