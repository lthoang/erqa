It soaked in quickly and left my skin very very dry, it did nothing to reduce any redness, and in fact my skin felt irritated after using it. It is not moisturizing what so ever. I am not sure what it does at all. I had to go behind it and use another lotion.", "\"I've been using this serum both in the morning and evening before applying moisturizer and I really like it.  It has a great, light feel to it and makes my skin feel wonderfully hydrated.  A bonus is that my moisturizer goes so much farther when I use this serum first.  My skin has been looking brighter and healthier than it has for a while - so I'm hooked.  I will definitely be buying more of this AINHOA Concentrate.  My only complaint is that I've started using the AINHOA Purifying Fluid as well and the names are printed in a small font in grey-toned colors on a frosted, grey bottle - so it's really hard to read the labels and to tell the two products apart - but that's a nitpick.  I love everything else about this product.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful. If you'd also like to ask a question or leave a comment I usually respond the same day, so if you have a question or comment (even if it's just to say, Hi!\"\") feel free to post it below.Thanks,Claire\"", "This is a wonderful facial skin serum.  No irritation, no itching, not oily - just softness.  I really enjoyed this product as I have sensitive skin and can't use many skin care items.  This was an excellent find.", "I must say, for a spa product to splurge on I have been pretty happy with this. I live in an extremely arid area and since I've used this in addition to my moisturizer my skin is looking good: bright, no little skin bumps or flakes & soft to the touch. ie. I no longer look papery and dried out from the ill effects of winter weather and the arid Wyoming plains.The fact that the item is also devoid of any scent of any kind is another huge plus, they really did go out of their way, it seems to provide a decent sensitive skin product that avoids any possibility of allergic reactions.I also appreciate that this product plays well with other products with no weird chemical clash, which can result in some unpleasantness. I have used this with both my moisturizer and a variety of sunscreens with no problems. I have really got to respect that.I do intend to keep this product in with my facial repertoire.", "\"I've had mild rosacea for a few years, often made worse by anti-aging products, basic moisturizers and makeup. In other words, it's been difficult for me to find face care products that don't make it worse, and nothing has actually cleared it up... until now! When I received the AINHOA Sensitive Skin Concentrate, I was aware that it isn't a moisturizer, but instead a pre-moisturizing serum. With the first application, I noticed reduced redness, and after a full week of regular use beneath sensitive skin moisturizer, my rosacea is obviously clearing up! HURRAY! I'll keep buying this product for the forseeable future. Please note, a little goes a long way; two pumps will cover face, neck and chest. If you have rosacea, please let me encourage you to try this product.Edited to add (2/24): After reading other reviews warning about chemicals in this product, and specifically those related to breast cancer, I stopped using this until I could do some research. I had DCIS in 1999, and my mom had a mastectomy in July 2012 for stage 4 invasive ductal carcinoma. There is no clinical, reported link between parabens and breast cancer according to reputable, national cancer websites. Also, \"\"anti-freeze\"\" (glycol) is a very common preservative that's used in the vast majority of moisturizers and other skin care products, including those for infants, adult sensitive skin, and even labeled and advertised natural products; it keeps the products from becoming rancid, and replaces alcohol and/or petrolium products that are harsher to skin.I'm once again using the product, because for *me* it works. It obviously doesn't for everyone. My personal theory is that I dye my hair, the gentle shampoos and soaps I use contain chemicals, as do most household cleaning products (including those that are supposedly safer)... peroxide is a caustic chemical, folks. To my mind, a drop or two of this serum on my face, neck and chest every day is no worse--and probably a lot safer to use--than many, many other things. Have you seen the chemical listings for sunscreen? It's a personal choice. Yours might differ from mine.\"", "I had high hopes that product would calm whatever strange rash has taken over my neck and chest. The dermatologist said it is excema, but it looks like acne to me and itches like crazy.  I applied this product to my face neck and chest nightly after washing my face, and sometimes in the morning after my shower.  All I can say is that it didn't make my skin worse or better, it basically had zero effect on me.  It isn't particularly moisturizing and is fairly light weight.  It has a light pleasant smell, didn't clog my pools or cause and breakouts.  It did soften the feel of my skin some, but any facial fluid will do that.  If it calmed my itch or lessened my skin irritation I would be thrilled but it just didn't.  I really can't see spending money on a calming fluid that doesn't calm.", "This lotion comes with a nice, working pump, which dispenses a thin line of the pearlescent moisturizing lotion.I suffered from terrible wind burn during this past snow blizzard. Besides dry, chapped lips, my face was red, dry and flakey. Indoors was no better, with the furnace drying the air further.If ever I needed a skin product that really soothed and brought skin back to normal, it was now.I tried everything for chapped lips on my seriously chapped lips to no avail.This comforting lotion feels good on application. My lips showed great improvement within 24 hours.The flakes started diminishing and my hot wind burned skin took on it's normal color after a few days.My skin is now back to normal thanks to this rapidly working, serious fluid.It did wonders for me and I recommend it highly.", "I used this product on one half of my face and used my normal (natural) skin cream on the other half.  In terms of the response, it was the same.  I did not see any change.I liked this product.  I liked the smell and the silky feel of it.  It is light and does not have a strong odor or a sticky feel to it.  AND.... it is substantially more expensive than the high quality cream I use on my face with exactly the same results.", "Got this product for my wife (in her 40's) - her skin is sensitive and tends to be dry due to regular use of Retin-A. She liked this serum because is moisturized well, without irritation, but needed another layer of face cream on top of it. Also good as a stand-alone eye cream.", "I will never use this product again.  Supposedly for sensitive skin, I put a small amount on my face, and felt no tingling or burning initially.  An hour later, my skin was burning.  It actually woke me from sleep.  Fortunately, I dabbed only a small amount around my chin.  This may make your skin soft, but for me, it's not worth the pain.", "This lotion is great!  It goes on super smooth and does not leave behind a greasy film. I have seen a noticeable difference in the amount of dryness in my skin since I have been using this item.  My only complaint is the design of the bottle.  The way the tube is made makes it impossible to see how much of the product is left. Other than that I love it!", "I liked it well enough, but it didn't really do anything amazing for my skin. Actually, NOTHING seems to work any miracles. I have tried cheaper stuff, more expensive stuff (Dermalogica usually), cocoa and shea butter, olive oil, and nothing really seems to change my skin a whole lot. It isn't super dry, but has spots that definitely need moisture. Honestly (and this is going to sound weird,) vaseline has worked as well as anything else. Yes, the greasy slimy stuff. Left on overnight is one of the few products I have found that seems to make my eye area nicer the next morning.I was ready to give this a very mediocre review, but figured maybe I was expecting too much. So I used this for a few days on one side of my face only. I didn't seem to feel any difference whatsoever, BUT! I asked my husband to touch both sides of my face to see if he noticed any difference between the two. And he (after one touch on each) immediately picked the side where I used this. So it must do more than I thought! So I don't think I can dismiss it so quickly after all!I will keep using the rest of the bottle and see if it works even better. I think the price is higher, but it is comparable to even items from a supermarket (some of those little tubes are very expensive per ounce!) I will update my review if I change my mind, but right now, I am leaning toward getting it again (especially from my husband's rating!)", "I am a big fan of the Dead Sea cosmetic products and have used Ahava, Avani and Swissa. My favorites are their eye gels or emulsions, which are very light, yet very effective, firming and long lasting. If you've visited the malls, you know they cost you an arm and a leg.So this AINHOA emulsion feels just like the above. A little goes a long way. My skin loves this light, fast absorbing and long lasting serum. Totally hypoallergenic - is that the right word. Well you know what I mean.", "I have been fighting bouts of adult acne due to a hormonal imbalance I am experiencing recently. I've been treating my skin with acne products only to find that it is red, flaky with dryness and irritated.  I started using this under my daily moisturizer and I have found that it soothes my irritation and lets my other products do their job without further irritating me.  I find it to be a little cooling and soaks in smooth and doesn't leave a greasy feel. It feels fresh and clean.", "\"I have extremely sensitive skin.  It is very dry and I have a lot of allergies.  This product does provide some moisture but I did not feel that it \"\"calmed\"\" my face.  I felt a little irritated in the evenings after I had put it on in the morning.  It's really hard to find good soothing creams and serums for the sensitive face, even from the dermatologist.  I'm not sure I'd say the benefits outweigh the cost on this one.  It is very nicely packaged and feels and looks very high end in its presentation I will say.\"", "I was looking forward to trying this serum. I have sensitive skin and this sounded like a gentle and natural fluid.  The write up mentions that it contains marigold, camomile and lime tree extracts but doesn't mention all the chemical components. It has a fairly long ingredient label and also contains: Water, cyclopentasoliane, proplyene glycol, polyacrylaminde, dimethicone polysorbate 40 and goes on and on with chemical components.  After using it for a week and ended up getting a rash so I stopped.The other serums I use, Jurlique herbal recovery gel and Ole Henriksen Truth Serum, are both much more natural, with more herbal ingredients and less chemicals and work really well with my sensitive skin.I would not recommend this facial fluid.", "I didn't really see the results of this product.  It didn't live up to all its fabulous claims.  But then again, most skin care products don't.  I was pleased that there was no noticeable smell, and it did no harm to my sensitive skin.", "\"I must admit I haven't used this product. I read what I could about it before ordering it and once it arrived and I looked at the ingredients list, I was appalled because the company touted it as being another \"\"natural\"\" product.This stuff has all the types of parabens women with, or previously had, breast cancer should avoid! It has been awhile since I have come across a product that still uses these preservatives. It's the reason I quit looking at products in professional hair salons. When will they stop? I know several breast cancer victims who avoid the parabens like the plague!I have come to the conclusion that just because it says natural it is rarely the case! Better off just to look for the organic versions.\"", "Some nights, I just want a nice, light-feeling moisturizing product that feels like it is hydrating my skin. My skin is very sensitive--using medium-to-heavy products for more than a couple of days usually winds up breaking me out and causing clogging/problems. So far, this serum has done a great job. It has a light, smooth feel and goes on very silkily. If you do have sensitive skin and are seeking something to help, this might well be worth a try. It is a bit pricey, but I've paid more at the cosmetic counter for so-so results. Personally, I find that rotating some quality products like this works best for me. For my use, it's definitely 5-star.", "I get redder around my nose than the rest of my face so I was more then happy to try a lotion that promised to reduce that redness. When I first put the lotion on I was impressed with the non-greasy feel and the lack of fragrances. I personally like that frou frou smell in my grooming items, but such additions would not be good for sensitive skin. The lotion went on with a smooth coolness that felt good on my skin, but once it was dry a few minutes later, my nose didn't appear to be much less red. I used it for a week and found although it seemed to calm the redness in my skin down a bit, it wasn't a miracle product that had me oohing and ahhing, and for the price, it should make we want to do flips. I'll use the product until it's gone, but I can't say I'll be back for more."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.04748660698533058, 0.03983845189213753, 0.053657930344343185, 0.05407848209142685, 0.04990364611148834, 0.05376484990119934, 0.04958432540297508, 0.047160692512989044, 0.05036511644721031, 0.048314981162548065, 0.04736926406621933, 0.04638494923710823, 0.05094112828373909, 0.052297286689281464, 0.06027504429221153, 0.04717811197042465, 0.05064616724848747, 0.04810328781604767, 0.053351983428001404, 0.04929763078689575]]}
