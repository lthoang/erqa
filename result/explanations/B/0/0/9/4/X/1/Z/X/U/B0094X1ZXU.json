Buy it from Amazon too cause it's cheaper :)", "Well the Nintendo nunchuk controller is just what it is a great accessory to go along with the system an added value that keeps getting good.", "Needed to play wii games on the wii U, I got the white one to match my white wii u.", "\"When I started using this nunchunk it was working fine. I have used it very rarely in the 4 months I have owned it, and today it stopped working.Out of a sudden a game told me \"\"reconnect nunchunk\"\" even so I hadn't disconnected it, so I unplugged and plugged it again to the wiimote, without success. I haven't been able to make it work in the past hour (I even changed the batteries of the wiimote thinking it was that). (My bought was at TOYBUZZ)\"", "An over excited youth let his nunchuk fly from his hand and it flew straight into a wall.  After picking up cracked pieces from the floor, our choice was obvious.  Replacement!  This Nintendo Nunchuk controller does the trick just as the original did.", "I recall them selling a 3rd party nunchaku on the old LikSang? site before they shut it down. You could use their nunchaku with the Dual Shock 2 on PS2 and play Resident Evil Dead Aim just like Nintendo copied to design their Wii system around.It's not so original if you knew what was going on there, but this serves it's purpose ok I guess. I don't like Nintendo's design of angular slots on their analog stick encasings, they try to give you analog D pad control coinciding with full analog rotation which is annoying .I think it's overpriced, it's only worth about $10", "I mean, really. This is just a piece of plastic. The worst part is when games require this in multi-player, which is the case in Nintendo Land's Metroid attraction. You'll have to drop $80 just to play with 4 friends.", "With so many fake Wii controllers being sold on Amazon, we were hesitant to buy this one, even though Amazon had it listed as an updated version of the Wii Nunchuck.  But, since it was a little cheaper we decided to trust Amazon and give it a shot.We used it to play Smash Brothers on our Wii for about an hour so far and it's worked fine.  It looks like real Nunchucks we've bought in the past, has the same feel, the only difference we've seen so far is that it's a few dollars cheaper and it just came in a box marked Wii U.I'll update this if we notice any problems, but so far it seems like a good, authentic, controller for Wii.", "Works like it is suppose to.  Was an official Nintendo item, new in box from Amazon.  Now I can play Mario Land with my nunchuk.", "Works great and never had an issue with it. Certainly durable as well. The real nintendo nunchuk is a great game innovation.", "Basically, I would recommend sticking only to Nintendo manufactured products. They always work and tend to be more solidly built.", "There is no question that with so many Nintendo Wii gamers anxiously awaiting the Wii U's arrival, many gamers might feel the need to upgrade to the potentially Wii U gamepad to get to be able to play Nintendo Wii games for the Nintendo Wii U. That isn't the case. Like when Gamecube games were compatable with the Nintendo Wii, you were able to play classic games on the Wii. That is the case here. The Wii Nunchuck Controller is a must of a lot of Nintendo Wii titles like Super Mario Galaxy 2 and The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. It works very well on great games for the Nintendo Wii as well as Wii games that can be downloadable like Thruspace. The control is very responsive to any great game, and definitely a must to own if you still are seeking games for the Nintendo Wii, and definitely are looking forward to having the Wii U, and playing great Wii games in the future.Price: B+Control: A-Overall: B+", "If you want to play any game that has a story mode in which you move in, you need to buy one of these. This controller gives you so much control of your character. It feels just like a pro analog stuck that you see on an xbox. You can't experience the wii's full potential without this."], "Gamma": [0.05773637443780899, 0.05766500160098076, 0.057739950716495514, 0.05768628790974617, 0.05746423825621605, 0.05446341261267662,
