"], "reviews": ["I bought these packages thinking that the cheese sauce would taste great but it really does not.  The powdered sauce that you add after boiling the little pasta rings is weak, artificial tasting  and not very enjoyable.  I was really disappointed in the flavor.  I even added butter after a few bites to try to fix it......it did not help.  I still have 7 boxes left so that shows how uninterested I am in eating this bland food.  It would have been much more ecconomical to just buy a box of pasta and buy regular cheese to add to it.  There is nothing wrong with this product except it's fairly dull tasting and expensive for what you get.  I will not be buying this product again.", "\"My family loved this.  I've never seen little Cheerio sized rings of pasta before but they hold the cheese well.The flavor is excellent, very creamy and rich tasting. It says on the box it is an \"\"All-Natural Family Side Dish\"\" and while it is mostly natural, I wouldn't say it is 100% natural.  But natural is a key word these days in marketing with no legal meaning as far as a food product goes.Here are the ingredients as listed on the side of the box:Pasa Rings (wheat Flopur, Rosemary Extract), Cheddar Cheese (culteured pasteurized milk, Salt, nonfat milk, whey, maltodextrin, butter (cream, salt), salt, disodium phosphate, yeast extract, natural flavor, extractives of annatto for color.What that last ingredient is I have no idea and disodium phosphate doesn't exactly sound natural to me, nor does matodextrin, but I'm no expert.Of course there is a high sodium content as with many packaged foods. There are two servings per box and one serving contains 750 mg of sodium.Fat is 3.5 g, saturated fat is 2g, cholesterol is 10 mg, and protein is 12 g.  One serving is 350 calories so this isn't a diet food of course.This is every bit as good as the old standard Kraft mac and cheese.  It's a nice sized package for two to four people to have as a side dish.You first cook the pasta, then add milk and butter to the cheese packet and cook it until well mixed, then add the pasta to that.Or you can cook it in an easy two step process in the microwave.It's a fast easy side dish that while not really being all natural, is filling and delicious.\"", "Over the years I have grown fond of trying different pastas. Each has their own uniqueness and while often made of the same ingredients, the shape itself adds texture and in some cases nooks and crannies for the sauce to hide.This little box is a combination of spaghetti-os and Mac and cheese. Somehow the shape of the pasta just didn't do it for me. Perhaps for a little one looking for a new way to eat their favorite food ... But for me, I'm sticking to the &#34;blue box.&#34;", "The Rings 'N Cheese pasta was fast and easy to make; just like another brand. The rings are little tiny--a little smaller then a Cheerio. Cute little pasta shapes that would be good for a young child to eat-easy to handle. My teenager thought it tasted blah and I have to agree. You add milk, butter and the powdered cheese to make it. The flavor is nothing special, bland.", "We're trying to clear a great deal of processed foods from our house, but sometimes we need something quick and easy that doesn't take much thinking. When I saw that these meals were all natural, I figured they would be the answer to that issue. There are definitely fewer ingredients compared to the similar macaroni products.The flavor of this one was a little too mild for our tastes. Maybe with some extras, it could have potential. Even with similar Kraft boxed macaroni, I add extra cheese and all to help it out. We typically do ours from scratch or the specialty macaroni and cheese, though. If you like the regular macaroni and cheese, but want more natural ingredients, definitely give this a try!", ". Easy to prepare. Tiny pasta. One thing I will say is that it cooked quickly.The taste was good.  This isn't the healthiest product on the market, but for what it is and the price, it is good.", "I've tried several of the SideMates products and found them to be very good - flavorful, easy to prepare and relatively healthy. Of all of the products, this was my least favorite, not because it was so different in flavor or prep or healthfulness but because the rings themselves didn't hold up in the prep process and turn to mush. So the cheese and the rings are just a blob when prepared. It tasted good but it wasn't pleasant in texture. I think the rings need to be a bit heartier for this product to be successful.Try the Pearl Couscous from SideMates. It's amazing.", "For all of its fancy packaging, what you have here is basically Mac & Cheese. In my mind, I pictured the Os about the size of SpagettiOs, but they are much smaller. They are about the size of a pencil eraser. I was hoping they would be larger so my one year old would be able to pick them up more easily. These were way too small for her to finger feed herself. The taste was pretty good, but I'm not sure it's worth the price.", "I don't even know how to describe this.  Imagine mushy, squishy rings that feel slimy in your mouth, covered in a salty, bland sauce that doesn't taste like cheese.  That describes this.  The instructions call for 3 tablespoons of milk and 3 tablespoons of butter.  Yes, you heard me right, 3 tablespoons of butter.  So, in addition to the salty, slimy texture you have slippery to add to it.  I like butter.  I like extra butter on my popcorn.  I did not like the butter in this side dish.  The cheese sauce doesn't taste like cheese, it tastes like salt.  The dish, once prepared, doesn't look like the picture.  The cheese sauce doesn't stick well to the noodles, it kind of pools, so that they float in it.I can't recommend this and I won't be rushing out to buy any, any time soon.", "Making this mac and cheese product was as easy as any other boxed mac and cheese product you can find at the supermarket. I did not really care for the flavor of this product. It was a bit to bland for me. I had to perk it up by adding more salt and cheese. I like the Side-Mates couscous dishes that I have tried. This mac and cheese dish, however, is not as good.", "We go through frequent mac and cheese spells and therefore care about mac & cheese style dishes.  Mac and cheese can be made in many ways.* This version is too small, in my view.  Also, it tastes too buttery for me.  Now some people like it much more buttery than I do.* Whereas the ingredients hint at great taste by using rosemary extract, the taste didn't suit me or my kids.  It had a slight tang.", "This is a twist on conventional mac and cheese with small circular pasta rather than the typical elbow or short tubular pasta. It does look more interesting on the plate than the usual mac and cheese, but comes up wanting with regard to how the pasta tastes.The cheese mix (which is powdered) has a somewhat decent cheese taste. You'll certainly not confuse it with home made mac and cheese, but it's on a par with other powdered cheese mixes. Certainly in the cheddar-taste ballpark.The pasta, however, is not appealing. It has a somewhat gummy texture, and has very little taste on its own.While the small shape of the pasta makes for quick cooking and a more visually interesting plate, this is not something I'd get again.", "The gold standard in dried macaroni and cheese is Kraft. The blue box has been around forever and is the standard by which every box of macaroni and cheese is measured. Sometimes there are things that make a box go above Kraft, organic Annie's and her home spun fighting the man image, is one notable example. Gosh I wish that Osem were in the Annie's league. Unfortunately, the ring shaped pasta and cheese dish falls short. It isn't bad, but it isn't good. Number two son said, it isn't bad; I'd never get it again.The rings are teeny tiny, about the size of the tiniest ring in Chef Boy R Dee's Spaghetti O's. They are so tiny; they pass through the holes in most normal colanders. This doesn't make for a great shape to hold cheese sauce. The pasta isn't very good, it is delicate to cook, a minute too long and the pasta is mush, and a little bit of time too short and it is gummy. The cheese sauce requires milk, butter, and the cheese powder pouch and cooking over the stove independent of the pasta (a second pot is dirtied along with a mesh strainer). The cheese powder is incredibly fine, actually too fine. It does not dissolve easily in the milk, so the sauce ends up lumpy. There is an art to making good cheese powder; sadly, Osem hasn't learned that art yet.In the end, shapes, sizes, and lumpy sauce wouldn't be a horrible insurmountable problem. Nah, when the flavor is off, that kind of kills repeat performances for a dish. There is decent cheese flavor, maybe not the tanginess of Kraft. But the worst part was the pasty flat flavor, like burned milk or cheese. There wasn't much of a salt flavor either. I wasn't a huge fan of the odor.Side Mates tried hard to do something a little different. Sadly they missed the mark. The product is Circle U Dairy Kosher. And it is made with all natural ingredients. If you are really concerned about organic and homespun image, Annie's the way to go. If traditional flavor is more important, Kraft blue box can't be beat. I would not repeat this. Although if I found this in the dollar store for $0.50, I'd buy it.", "I fixed the Side Mates Rings 'n Cheese for my boys who are big macaroni fans. I think I added too much milk and the pasta ended up having way too much liquid in it so I just served it to them like a pasta cheese soup and they loved it. To me the taste wasn't that cheesy or creamy.It didn't take long to cook and it was easy enough to prepare but the powdered cheese mix didn't blend very easily.This has a little more natural ingredients than some other brands but the price is pretty high since you can still get plain ole box of mac and cheese for less than a dollar. Taste was fine but just based on price, I would probably try another brand.", "As they say, it's nothing to write home to mother about.  No, the Rings `N cheese aren't, but they aren't all that bad depending on how you prepare them.  Keep in mind that the cooking time is rather short and unless you want mush, you'd best pay attention to what you are doing.  In three to five minutes, you'll have a Side Mate on the table.I'm definitely an Annie's fan and have been for some time.  When you do the all-natural bit and rarely do organic or all-natural, things taste different.  I primarily eat both and I know that people detest some things I like.  A couple of things that were odd was that the dish was fairly high in sodium at 750mg, but called for unsalted butter in the preparation.  Three tablespoons was a little overkill if you ask me.One thing that I did like was that it was high in protein at 12g per serving.  I did like the rings (I didn't overcook them) and the texture was nice.  Taste?  Well, it was only so-so, but in the back of my mind I'm wishing I prepared a box of Annie's instead.NUTRITION FACTS:(Dried mix followed by prepared if applicable)Serving Size 85g dry mix;  about (1 cup) perparedServings Per Container:  2Calories:  320  480Fat Calories:  35  100Total Fat:  3.5gSaturated Fat 2gTrans Fat 0gCholesterol:  10mgSodium:  750mgTotal Cargs:  60gDietary Fiber:  3gSugars:  4gProtein:  12gINGREDIENTS:Pasta Rings (Wheat Flour, Rosemary Extract), Cheddar Cheese (Cultured Pasteurized Milk, Salt, Enzymes), Nonfat Milk, Whey, Maltodextrin, Butter (Cream, Salt), Salt, Disodium Phosphate, Yeast Extract, Natural Flavor, Extractives of Annatto for Color.CONTAINS WHEAT, MILK.SIDE MATES:Rings `N CheeseQuinoa with Rice, Black Beans, and CornPearl Couscous, the OriginalTraditional Couscous, Roasted Garlic and BroccoliPilaf with Rice, Pasta, Garlic, and HerbsPearl Couscous, Portabella Mushroom, and Sun-Dried TomatoesTraditional Couscous, Three CheesePearl Couscous, Roasted Garlic and Parsley", "I've tried other Side Mates dishes and enjoy the flavor of the Ring pasta and cheese as well, but you could probably create a healthier recipe.

The final product is fairly thick and creamy, which is nice, but given the nutrition information, a single serving (a box offers two servings) is 65% daily value of Sat Fat, 20% cholesterol and 32% sodium.Again, the flavor is nice, but I might cut out a scoop or two of butter, or maybe add additional pasta to thin out the recipe.  You could also substitute water for milk, I suppose.  Also, the rings are VERY small.  Smaller than Cheerios or Spaghetti-o's, for comparison, so the final product is just kind of this pasta... stuff.

I could not have been more wrong. Here is my experience:-Foremost, we used the traditional stove-top method of cooking since we believed this would give the product the best chance for success. What we had in the pot after the mandated six minutes were bloated, tiny \"\"o\"\"s.-I was so astonished when I read THREE tablespoons of butter that I reread the SMALL box twice ... talk about unhealthy. (I usually make Kraft Mac and Cheese with a tablespoon and a half and add fresh cracked pepper for a bit of extra flavor.)-When complete, my boyfriend and I each took a spoonful ... there was NO taste ... whatsoever. For all of that fat and sodium, I expected a punch of flavor. This is just a SUPER bland dish.-We disposed of the entire pot ... why consume all of that fat and sodium for something that literally does not even taste good.Like most vegetarians, this \"\"all-natural\"\" product does appeal to me. However, the calories, the fat, and the sodium make it anything but healthy. Do yourself (and your family) a favor ... stick to Kraft!\"", "And comes out kinda like a thick pasta cheddar soup.The pasta is like the size of those really small shrimps you find on salads in restaurants - I used a strainer rather than a colander.The end product was ok but the taste, the calories and the price will keep me buying Swanson frozen when I want mac & cheese.", "My kids really like this and it was fun to make the pasta when it boils rolls around looks really cool. It tasted great and everyone in my family really liked it.", "This is not traditional mac and cheese with the big noodles. This is a delicious little round o noodle similar to abc's in soup or stars in chicken stars soup.We like different shapes of pasta and this is a great one.

The only thing of note was that the ingredients said the pasta contained rosemary, but I couldn't taste any of it at all.  If you are looking for a standard, easy-to-make macaroni and cheese, either to eat plain or to spice up with additional ingredients, this is a pretty good product.I made it without the butter that the instructions called for, and it still tasted fine and didn't end up too runny.", "We loved the Side Mate Couscous offerings and assumed we would love these too. But the things I liked about the other SideMate products were absent here.We followed the directions carefully but still ended up with a sticky mess.

It's just blah. There is not a great cheesy taste.", "If I need a convenience pasta and cheese side dish, it will NOT be this one.  Gimme' good old Kraft Dinner!  The original Mac n' Cheese!

No thank you!", "a nice alternative side dish. Easy to make, quick preparation. my granddaughter loves to help make dinner (she's 7) and this is an easy dish for her to help make supper.", "\"I have loved macaroni and cheese since I was a child (who doesn't?) and have eaten innumerable varieties of it.  The Ring Shaped Pasta and Cheese from Side Mates is the strangest, most bizarre macaroni and cheese I have ever prepared.  The \"\"rings\"\" are very small--almost too small.  From a distance, the cooked rings nearly blend together into one bright, yellow-orange glob.  This side dish was a little more difficult to prepare than other pasta side dishes from Side Mates.  Mainly because I had to drain the pasta rings.However, I didn't follow the directions on the box; they were odd.  I have never prepared macaroni and cheese in that manner.  The box directed the preparer to rinse the pasta in hot water, prepare the cheese mixture, and then add the pasta to the cheese mixture and stir.  This seemed awkward.  I have never rinsed pasta intended for macaroni and cheese.  The only pasta I have ever rinsed was for a pasta salad, and I rinsed it in cold water.  Why rinse pasta intended for macaroni and cheese?  Instead, I drained the water from the pasta rings, dumped the hot pasta rings into a beautiful glass bowl intended for serving and then directly added the cheese, milk and butter.The hot pasta rings melted the butter.  I was then able to easily mix everything together until the pasta rings were well coated with cheese.  This type of macaroni and cheese tasted very good.  I served it with Gorton's Crispy Battered Fish Fillets that I baked in my oven for twenty-four minutes.  I got this idea from looking at the back of the box for the pasta rings.  It showed the pasta rings lying on a plate next to some tasty-looking salmon fist sticks.  In lieu of the buttery vegetables that were also shown on the box, I served a garden salad.Eating the pasta rings from Side Mates made me feel like a child again.  It brought back great memories of Mom fixing simple meals for my brother and I.  I recommend the Side Mates Ring Shaped Pasta and Cheese but I wouldn't prepare it according to the directions on the box.  I would prepare it in the traditional manner that you are accustomed to preparing it.  The key is to make sure the pasta rings are hot enough to melt the butter.  If not, dump them into a glass serving bowl and microwave them.Joseph B. Hoyos\"", "\"Made this as a side dish (to accompany Sanderson Farms chicken - my new favorite brand of chicken - salad and stir-fried vegies) and we loved it. It tasted better to me than Kraft Mac & Cheese. Stovetop preparation is easy and fast (can also be made in microwave). It says to boil the ring shaped pasta for 3-5 minutes; at a rapid boil 3 minutes was not enough so I gave them 4 and even then they didn't seem to soften up enough until sitting in the strainer another minute while I mixed 3 tablespoons each of milk (I used 1% but the instructions don't specify) and unsalted butter (the instructions specify unsalted) with the cheese packet contents. So the 6 minutes cooking time stated on the package is exactly right. No MSG, 750 mg sodium per serving (as long as you do use unsalted butter), two 1-cup servings per container, 480 calories per prepared serving. Reheated some in microwave next day uncovered and as is (i.e., did not add water or any other liquid), for 2 minutes at 50 percent heat and it came out as if freshly made.Side Mates are distributed by Osem USA. As we are told at Osem's Osem USA page, \"\"The Osem Company is Israel's leading exporter of kosher food to the USA. The US subsidiary Osem USA (fully owned  by the Osem Group) is considered the number one importer of food products from Israel, operating an efficient and strong marketing network.\"\" Osem started in Israel in 1942 when Israel's various noodle factories amalgamated. I found it interesting to read about Osem's history, vision, and code of business conduct at the Osem site.\"", "\"Pasta and cheese is actually a common dish in our house.  We normally boil regular pasta and then melt cheddar cheese over the top, so boxed pasta and cheese is already a little processed for my family's taste.  That being said, there are some brands we have purchased and enjoy as a convenience food, so I wanted to see how this compared.  Some boxed products are so awful they are inedible, and some I'd say are good enough to get 4 stars.  Where does \"\"Side Mates\"\" rate?I wouldn't say it is bad, only that it is rather bland and honestly didn't taste like much.  The pasta rings themselves are too small and ended up with the consistency of cat food rather than pasta and cheese, more of a mush than pasta.  Perhaps there is a reason that most products use elbow macaroni.  These ring shaped pastas are good in soup and Spaghetti O's, but just don't work in cheese sauce as a pasta and cheese dish.So not really bad tasting, but I don't recommend it.\"", "My feelings on this product are really hovering in the indeterminate zone between three stars and four; I went with four because I guess I'm feeling generous.This is a solid, filling product.  It's meant to be served as a side dish but I wound up eating it as a meal, a large late lunch that wound up being in lieu of dinner.  (And just as well; one thing that bothered me was that, according to the nutrition facts, the box is supposed to contain two servings, but when you open the packaging you see that really your only option is to cook everything at once.)  The taste was pleasant enough.  Other reviewers have said the cheese sauce is too thin; I did not find this, but then I realized too late that I'd misinterpreted the cooking instructions and put in too much butter (Smart Balance, actually).  Maybe that's the trick?  Mixing the cheese sauce together was really quite a chore, though the pasta cooks so quickly that I guess it makes up for it.  I couldn't believe how tiny the rings are; they look small on the box, but even that doesn't really do it justice.  There are a zillion of them so it manages to be filling just the same, and there's no challenge in scooping them out of the bowl, though you might need to use a spoon instead of a fork.Satisfying as a small meal, and I suppose it would work as a side dish as well if you're not eating alone.", "Our family loves every other Side Mates product we've tried, but this one was a striking exception.  I was hoping for a good alternative to mac and cheese, but this didn't fit the bill.First, the pasta-o's, although quick cooking, did not taste that great.  They are so thin that it's hard to get them at that perfect al dente point, and easy to end up with slightly mushy pasta.  They have a wheaty taste which might be good in some dishes, but tasted odd with powdered cheese.Second, the powdered cheese is a mess.  The directions say to mix with milk over the stovetop, but all we ended up with was clumps.  After a minute or two of stirring with a spoon, I gave up and beat the sauce with a whisk for another minute or two, but still ended up with a grainy, clumpy sauce.  After all that, it basically tasted like powdered cheese sauce, which wasn't much payoff for the work involved.Maybe I did something wrong - as I've said, I've loved all the other Side Mates products I've tried.  And tastes differ, so maybe you'll love Side Mates Rings and Cheese, but I can't recommend it.", "\"So what we have here is \"\"ring shaped pasta & cheese\"\" that advertises itself as 'both a side and a meal'.Well, ok. It's silly to really care about if something is a 'side' or a 'main' or whatever.What this really is, is pretty much your standard boxed macaroni and cheese, only with tiny ring shaped pasta. While the small size means it'll cook faster, I can't really say anything else about it is worthwhile. The smallness works against it too -- it means it's harder to deal with in the collander when draining, and harder to clean out of the pot when doing said draining.As for taste, it's just....bland. Kraft is better. Aunt Annie's is much better. And it doesn't help that suggested butter amount is 1tbsp more than normal for the same six oz.There's not much else one can say about it. I recommend Aunt Annie's, as it's not only even 'more' all natural (if that makes sense) but is a bit cheaper anyway. Still if you really want mac and cheese make it yourself....but this here is a bad alternative either way.\"", "\"I prepared the Side Mates Rings 'n Cheese last night to go with leftover ribs and chicken. It's quick and easy to prepare, though a separate saucepan is to be used to do the mix of three tablesppons of milk, three tablespoons of butter and the sauce mix while the noodles do their three to five-minute boil.I approve of the mildly cheesy flavor, though this is certainly not \"\"the cheesiest\"\" boxed pasta there is, it is still good for a processed box food.The picture on the box had me worried about how I'd drain these rings after the boil, because they appear to be the same size as those rubber bands kids use for their braces, but once boiled the pasta rings are about double the diameter, and I used a strainer to make sure no rings would fall through any colander holes and it worked great.The leftover rings and cheese, with about a tablespoon of additional water, heated up nicely in the microwave this afternoon for a snack. It tastes as nice as it did last night. If an all in one boxed mac and rings dinner is on the menu, this is good pasta. I like it and I would definitely eat it again.\"", "\"Side Mates Ring Shaped Pasta and Cheese, 6 OunceRice can, sometimes, be soooooo boring!
