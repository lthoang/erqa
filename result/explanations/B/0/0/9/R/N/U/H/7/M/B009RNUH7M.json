This is gentle enough to moisturize and protect my skin with out causing a reaction or leaving my skin feeling really oily. The oil-free SPF 15, vitamins B5 and E make this moisturizer a winner for me.", "Living in Tucson, Arizona, I really should use sunscreen more often than I do...when out taking the dog for walks and doing yard work.  Part of me not doing it is habit, and the other part is that the sunscreens that I've used tend to leave a white haze no matter how much I rub them in.  Perhaps my problem has been that I've gone for SPF numbers that are too high.  But, when I have to keep rubbing and rubbing and rubbing, and I still look like a vampire because the white coating won't go away...I tend to just not use it.  That, and the strong smell have kept me away.This product, though, is great for me.  Within a couple of seconds, it has rubbed in and there's no visible white haze at all.  That, and I can't feel that there's anything there.  It seems to rub in just like lotion.  The first time that I put it on, I was amazed.  The instructions say to use it on your face and neck, and I don't know why it doesn't say to use it everywhere that's exposed like I do (except that they recommend covering most of your skin with clothing).  While it still does have that sunscreen smell, it isn't a strong odor like some others that I've used.  I can smell it, but I need to hold my arm up to my nose to do it.I have dry skin, and I've read at least one other review from someone with oily skin that did not like this product.  It is much thicker in consistency than the Coppertone sunscreen that I was using, but it rubs in better on my skin.  I haven't tried a lot of different brands of sunscreen, so I can't say that this is the best one - but I can say that it's by far the best that I've tried.  I'm very happy that I was able to preview this product on Vine, and I expect to by buying more when my bottle starts to run low.  I recommend giving this a try if the SPF rating is high enough for your needs.", "I know what you are thinking, why did that idiot put this in her eyes. I didn't. I didn't rub it in either. I simply began putting it on my cheeks and my eyes began burning. I don't know if it was the scent or something else, but I couldn't finish putting it on my face to test it.I really liked the idea of a moisturizer with SPF 15, and it seemed to make my wrist feel nice. And i love the non-oily feel. So I am giving it three stars, since others will be able to use it.This is allergy season so my eyes are probably particularly sensitive right now. Suggest you buy with caution.", "I use this in a side by side comparison withPond's Luminous Moisture Day SPF 15 Lotion, 1.7 Ouncealso with 15Spf. I use both under liquid foundation as part of my daily regimen. I find the Ponds blends in better, feels lighter and is absorbed more quickly into my skin. The Simple moisturizer is thicker and feels stickier. That's no good when you have oily/combo skin like me, but might work for you if you have dry skin. But given the choice, I'm much happier with the Ponds. I just wish it had a higher SPF.", "I didn't mind the fragrance though it was a bit stronger than I had expected, and found the moisturizer worked fine as well. I like the simple bundling of protection - which will make it handy for the kids as we head into summer.", "This moisturizer is light and effective. My face tends to be dry and it worked all day without needing to reapply it. The bottle notes that there are no added perfumes, but it does have a light scent that I don't like. The smell doesn't prevent me from using the product, however. Overall, a good moisturizer.", "nice low odor, no irritation daily moisturizer.The Simple brand is very Neutrogena like.This product is comparable to the Neutrogena and Aquaphor and Cetaphil daily moisturizers.", "\"I've used the same moisturizer for years now, after going though quite a few different kinds. They all left my skin with various issues. I've liked some of the other Simple products enough that I wanted to give this moisturizer a try, though.I like that it left my skin feeling good. My skin has a tendency to feel dry and stretched out after showers, even with my moisturizer sometimes. This one did a great job!I also like that it has sunscreen in it! That is a necessity for me with moisturizer. My other one also has SPF 15, so I assume that's pretty decent for moisturizer.It has a \"\"fragrance free\"\" kind of smell(kind of clay like). It doesn't smell bad, though.Overall, this is a pretty good moisturizer!\"", "\"I like this moisturizer - it feels light going on my skin (I hate the feel of a heavy moisturizer - I feel like I need a towel to wipe it off), is not greasy, has no smell, and has the added benefit of SPF15. I have sensitive skin and didn't react to this lotion - either in a rash or with zits. My skin feels nice and soft after applying the lotion.While it doesn't contain any \"\"animal derived ingredients\"\", there are a lot of chemicals in this lotion. If you are at all sensitive, I would test this lotion for several days on your arms (or somewhere besides your face) to see if you react.\"", "\"First off, this is NOT a moisturizer for dry or very dry skin types. For oil or combination skin it may be just perfect. I liked the feel of it since it's nearly undetectable, but it may be just too light for mature skin or skin that's dehydrated- or your climate is dry. It leaves virtually NO feeling of moisturizer on the skin AT ALL. That was almost perfect for me since I enjoy wearing moisturizing foundation and most creams or lotions with SPF are just too heavy and feel like a mask. My make-up doesn't \"\"slide\"\" with this product, or cake.Pros:* Light, almost invisible texture; great for oily/combination skin or those who hate the feeling of moisturizer.* Unscented, except for the sunscreen ingredients which have a subtle scent similar to tanning lotion* Inexpensive* Contains Pro vitamin B5 & vitamin E. While I could find the vitamin E on the ingredient list, the B5 was strangely missing. I'm not sure how much either of these vitamins would do for the skin in very small quantities.* It has SPF 15* No dyes or perfumesCons:* Heck of alot of chemicals in there (which might account for the inexpensive price tag). This product most certainly would NOT appeal to those who prefer an organic or natural moisturizer.* Some of the ingredients ARE sensitizing for certain individuals. I would think twice about recommending this to those I know with \"\"reactionary\"\" skin. I took some time to check out the ingredients online and was concerned. My 2 nieces with sensitive skin most likely could NOT use this product.\"", "I'm using this moisturizer in conjunction withSimple Wipesand it works well, with a caveat. First, I've found that if I put the moisturizer on immediately after I use the wipes it burns a little. It's not really enough to be a big deal, but I can avoid this altogether if I just wait maybe a minute to moisturize. The bigger problem I have with the moisturizer if finding the sweet spot. It is very easy to over apply, and this leaves my skin feeling a little greasy. But, too little product and I feel like I've barely moisturized at all. I've been using this for over a week, and I still have a tendency to under apply, mainly out of over-application paranoia.", "This is a nice lightweight lotion. It is oil-free and non-greasy. It absorbs quickly into the skin. It has almost no fragrance. I like that it contains some sun protection (it has an SPF of 15). This saves me from having to apply a separate sunscreen. Although this is a facial lotion, I also like using it on my hands. I wash my hands a lot, so using this lotion on my hands reassures me that my hands have suncsreen on them all the time and are protected.", "\"I spend every day in the sun, so it's essential that I use a good sunscreen.  I have used a variety of sunscreens, but generally I find them to be very heavy and they tend to make me sweat.  This Simple-brand moisturizer is light and leaves my skin feeling hydrated without the thick, heavy feeling left by most sunscreens.  I have super-sensitive skin and I have had no problems at all with this moisturizer.  As a matter of fact, I like this product so much that I use it even when I'm not going out in the sun.  The only downside is that because it's only SPF 15 I have to reapply it if I'm in the sun more than a few hours, but if it were a higher SPF it would be thicker and heavier, so that's a trade-off that I gladly make.PS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful.

Unfortunately, it smells like a sunscreen product, which is tolerable if you are going to the beach but otherwise not desirable. I only used it a few times before stopping because of the odor.I looked up many of the ingredients on the EWG Cosmetic Database. This product fares pretty well compared to many. However there are some ingredients that raise a red flag, particularly ensulizole, which is known to \"\"produce free radicals when exposed to sunlight, leading to damage of DNA.\"\" Also, both Tocopheryl Acetate and Methylisothiazolinone are known to cause allergic reactions in some people.I did not suffer any allergic reactions but I do not plan to use this product again.\"", "This is a pretty good moisturizer. I'm using it mainly on my neck since it has some measure of sunblock protection, and it is working well. Goes on easy, has not produced any skin irritation, and does not leave a greasy feel. The SPF rating is only 15, but it does offer some measure of sun protection. The scent is light and dissipates pretty quickly.It's not the most heavy-duty moisturizer I've used, but it is effective. Well worth considering if you're looking for a light moisturizer.", "\"I'm always hesitant to try out a new product on my skin because it is sensitive.  For years I've been usingAveeno Active Naturals Ultra Calming Daily Moisturizer SPF 15and it works very well.  I switched toSimple Protecting Light Moisturizer Spf 15the same week I began usingSimple Radiance Wipesand thankfully I haven't had an issue with either.  The moisturizer goes on very light and it only takes a little to cover my face and neck. I like that it has the included SPF which I have been used to wearing on a daily basis, but I've noticed that it has that \"\"sunblock\"\" smell which I don't care for.  I questioned whether this was something that I had just become used to with the Aveeno, but side by side I can automatically tell which one is the Simple moisturizer. If it weren't for the scent I might consider switching to Simple permanently, but that minor thing keeps me from doing so.  Regardless of my issue with it, this is still a very good product and I recommend it.\"", "Skincare products can be confusing. Many moisturizers are adding sunscreen; the addition of sunscreen protects your skin but with some products like this Simple Protecting Light Moisturizer, the line between moisturizer and sunscreen begins to blur.This is a light, oil-free moisturizer with sunscreen that is supposed to have no harsh irritants but if sunscreen is irritating to your skin then this may bother you, it did me.For me personally, I didn't like it. It has the same active ingredients of a traditional sunscreen so even though the Simple line has no artificial perfumes, it smelled like sunscreen which I hate that scent.It also and more importantly for me was not moisturizing and I had to apply a different moisturizer after using this. It also stung my face a little because of the sunscreen.If you mainly want a sunscreen then you may appreciate this product but if you are seeking a moisturizer then you may be disappointed. I will definitely be using as a sunscreen and not as a moisturizer.", "I enjoy this rich facial lotion, that doesn't clog my pores.

I've been happy with how soft my face feels and I've even bought the night cream now.", "\"In my everyday life, my morning regimen isPhilosophy When Hope Is Not Enoughmixed withPhilosophy Turbo Booster C Powderand followed withPhilosophy Hope in a Jar Daily Moisturizer. However, none of these products have an SPF, so I frequently go out jogging while wearing all of this with Bare Minerals SPF foundation (which is the norm for where I live, but it's still not great to exercise while wearing make-up). Therefore, I gave this Simple product a try. Here was my experience:The Positives:-Barely any scent at all. Therefore, those who are sensitive to fragrances, may find this product is one of the few that are tolerable.-Dries really quickly.-Non-irritating (for me).-Great price for the amount of product one receives.The Negatives:-Super drying. Moreover, when I ran my fingers over my face to see if there was any tackiness, the product started to \"\"peel\"\"/\"\"roll\"\" off. A mineral makeup could not be layered over this (for me).-Provides no anti-aging benefits (at all). Therefore, it should be designated for a time when one needs a SPF for a short period of time.Bottomline:Great for your daily jog, bike-ride, run, etc. However, definitely not a part of your anti-aging routine and probably not for use under mineral makeup (at least for me).\"", "Simple lotion for sensitive skin is good for all skin types not just sensitive.  This is a light moisturizing lotion that soaks in immediately, and can be daily alone or under makeup.  The bonus is that it has 15 SPF to protect skin from UVA and UVB rays. Not a suntan lotion, but better than nothing.  Minimal light scent, barely detectable.  Spreads on evenly leaving skin feel hydrated and much softer.", "This product is very light.  It goes on easily and soaks in immediately.  There is no scent and it did not cause any problems for my sensitive skin.  It's a good basic moisturizer for normal to oily skin.  If your skin tends to be dry, it will probably not provide enough moisturizing.  Also, with an SPF of 15, it's not enough protection for sunny days.  You will need to use another product with it (or instead of it) to get better protection from the sun.", "Liked the smell of the product when you open it but did not care for the creamy feeling on my skin.

It does a nice job of moisturizing thanks to the glycerin, but won't make your skin much better in the long run aside from protecting it from the elements.  In this regard, it shines as it does a good job protecting from sunlight without using ingredients that pose a significant health concern.  The active ingredients are Octisalate, Avobenzone, and Ensulizole.  Each of these have low to minimal safety concerns (though Ensulizole is restricted for use in cosmetics in Japan.  Avobenzone does break down with exposure to sunlight so don't expect to use the SPF 15 to remain effective for more than an hour or two in the sun without reapplication.", "Although it may sound cliche, this product has everything you need and nothing you don't. I normally use Olay Complete because it's such a great moisturizer, but sometimes it does make my face feel a little irritated. This product has the same sunscreen ingredients as Olay, so it gives your face the same protection. It just doesn't irritate. It has lots of moisturizers too, so it will make your face feel really soft.I really loved the fragrance of this moisturizer too. It contains vitamins, and the ingredients are really good for your face. The fragrance is natural, so it won't be irritating. There are no artificial perfumes or dyes, so you don't have to worry about this irritant either.I will definitely use this moisturizer again because it makes my face feel really good, and the ingredients don't make it itch.  Very pleasing overall.", "This moisturizer seems perfect when first dispensed from the bottle, it has a great, lightweight texture and blends easily into the skin. The thing I can't get over is the smell. It smells like Oil of Olay Total Effects, unless they've changed the Total Effects formula to smell different since I last tried it. I always thought Total Effects was a product that worked well but the smell is awful and since it's ON YOUR FACE you can't get away from it.Another thing I noticed about this moisturizer is that it has an awful lot of weird ingredients for something with &#34;Simple&#34; in the name.

DANG IT! Some products aren't \"\"barely perceptible\"\" at all, but instead, as soon as I apply the cream/lotion, I know it must come off!

It's much less expensive than what I normally use and anytime I can save a buck or three - I'm a happy camper.Alas, this won't replace either of the other two brands as it appears to be more of a sunscreen than a true, twice daily moisturizer.  After two hours, in the house (and yes, we heat with wood, so the house is dryer than most), I could feel my face drying out, so I reapplied the creme and again, 2 to 3 hours later.  By the end of the day (and yes, I repeated this several days in a row), by face, instead of feeling moisturized, felt greasy and heavy.So, for me, it's back to my old standbys.  I may give the remainder of this product another try during the summer to see if it works any better then (as natural humidity will be up).  Bottom line, it's probably not a bad product at all - just not for me in my situation.", "When I first went to use this moisturizer on my face and neck, it felt just like putting on a thinner sunblock lotion.

It's also prevented any dryness I occasionally have without any signs of irritation.Like pretty much all sunscreen products I use, I simply trust that it's working at the strength specified, since I almost never visibly burn. It at least does specify both UVA and UVB coverage. The directions also say to apply every couple of hours. That is simply not feasible on most days.
