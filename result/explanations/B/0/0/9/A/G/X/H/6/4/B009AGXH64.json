The only downside is that the gamepad goes on every time you turn on the console, makes it annoying because it's only used on certain features, why would you want to turn it on if you have a Pro Controller? It really needs independence when using other controllers.", "\"The unit is full of technical issues, took me a whole day to get it updated, it lags, disconnects from the network every 30 minutes, and it takes forever to recognizes your TV. After this hell ended, I found out the Disc provided (Nintendo Land) is a complete joke, no real games, just some outdated boring mini games which most requires multiplayers, sadly for me im usually solo player. In addition to all of that, most Wii & possibly Wii U games require Nintendo Remote plus which is not provided in the so called \"\"deluxe\"\" box. In fact, having the remote is much more important than the gamepad, so you have spend extra bucks to buy the remote and probably will spend more to get the pro controller, all these addition spendings before you actually start to play a game.Comes to games, there is nothing to play except 2 or 3 worthy games, but I bought Wii U to play the missed Wii games, however, if you own Wii, I guess it's no point in upgrading to Wii U because there is nothing much to do with Wii U, unless you want to experience the HD figures which is not a brand new technology that nintendo is proud thay utilized.Nintendo seems they want to make something special that Sony and Microsoft cannot compete with, as much as I was excited, I'm disppointed now, knowing that Wii U will be smashed to the ground when sony launches PS4.\"", "I've had my Wii U since launch. I have been a loyal Nintendo customer since the NES. I am not pleased with this console and most of the reasons why are things that Nintendo could of and should have done different/better. They promised better 3rd party support. This is worse than previous consoles, not better. Most often if you hear of a game coming to xbox or PS it will not include Wii U.Next- Old tech. This console is nowhere near a s powerful as the PS4 or XB1. It cannot handle games coming out on the other newer consoles. PS4 and XB1 games are massive and require far more horsepower than Wii U can handle. So developers have no interest in the console. It's just a fact. PS4 and XB1 blow the Wii U away in every way. Wii U should have been the console to come out in the PS3/360 era as it is on par with those consoles.Next, a very poor installment base. Again- devs have no interest in the Wii U because it isn't selling well. It costs millions to make a game nowadays and they are just not going to make a decent profit off a Wii U title. Therefore the Wii U library of games is limited and poor. XB1 and PS4 have already passed what Wii U has done in sales in the first week of release. Even the new Mario game didn't help to make console sales. What has NINTENDO  done to try to increase sales? Little. See advertisements for a Wii U or game? Me either. Even at launch they did little to sell it. Ask people what a Wii U is. They either haven't heard of it or they think it is an add on to Wii. That is pathetic. But that is Nintendo's fault. They need to get a real PR team to save this thing.I just can't recommend the Wii U to anyone right now. Compared to the price and value of the XB1 or PS4 to the already outdated Wii U, it isn't a good deal at all. This console is not looking to do well. Sales stink and with the rise of PS4 and XB1, it is CERTAIN to get worse. I don't get any pleasure in saying these things. I love Nintendo  and they have always been very family friendly and created an incredible amount of  games that I love. But where are these games? Fans say they are coming. But it looks to be too little too late. How is this for pathetic? Want to buy Call of Duty? Well don't waste your money on the Wii U version. For BLOPs 2 and Ghosts, there will be no map packs released for it.  And that is just one example of how the Wii U is treated  by developers. A serious price drop and great original titles are needed to sway the heads of gamers looking for a new console away form XB1 and PS4. I own the Wii U, XB1, and PS4. I am saying this from my experience: Wii U is in trouble and it clearly is out gunned in this generation. If you can't get a PS4 or XB1, it would recommend a PS3 or Xbox 360 over a Wii U. A new console is cheaper and has an enormous amount of games to choose from. If you do decide to get a Wii U, you will enjoy a small selection of games to choose from(and some are simply excellent!) but you risk investing into a dying console and one that gets passed time and time again on new games from other developers. I sadly say I regret buying my Wii U now. It sits collecting dust most if the time. I played it for hours when I bought MArio 3D world, but I hadn't had it on in months prior to that. If Nintendo can get it's act together and prove it is dedicated to making this console stay alive and can bring amazing games, then I can recommend it.", "Before you buy one of these, take $440 (deluxe system + tax + one extra game) out of the bank and sit the stack down.  Look at it.  Smell it.  And then think about what you are getting for that with this system.Basically I bought it for two games. Nintendoland and Super Mario U. I have no interest in sloppy ports for games that I already own or never cared about. The system looks nice, the graphics look nice (on those two games anyway). I don't care about the Netflix, etc. I have a million other devices including my TV that already to all of this. It is cool that you can be watching something on Netflix and browse selection on the gamepad at same time. Other than that, the non-gaming features are meh. The load times are long for anything. Battery life is not good on the gamepad. I don't like the gamepad. I bought a nice tv because I want to look at it not a small screen. I have a 3ds, Vita, Nexus 7. I can look at one of those for that. I was very undecided as to whether or not i wanted one altogether. I decided to buy it from my brother at retail with the future in mind really only for Nintendo exclusives. I also wanted to give him someone to play with online. No one else seems to want one of these that we know.I had a chance to borrow my brother's system for days before deciding to take another new one off his hands. He couldn't use his really because of his girlfriend's kid who was getting one for Xmas. His connected to my network just fine and it stayed connected. no issues. The one that I got though would not connect for the life of me. Of course all of my other stuff worked fine. I found an article that said i should manually assign the IP and use weird DNS IP's. I did this and it then connected. Here is where the fun began. I tried doing the mother of all updates and it would download for a bit then drop connection and spit out an error code. I would then connect, test fine, and it would prompt me to download again and it would die at some point. I did this over and over for many times. Tried resetting network, etc. Nintendo's support page for this error suggested that I try again later, cut down on network traffic, or call support. I wasn't downloading or streaming anything and speedtested fine. I then decided that I would hardwire it.  No ethernet port.  I noticed that my original wii didn't have one either but, I never had issues with it or any other gaming system I have ever owned.  I will also mention that there is no optical audio out.  awesome.  I called support to ask the tech if they were having network issues. He said that they were not. Then I was put on hold while the tech 'researched' the issue. The call was disconnected. I tried to call back and there was just a bunch of static.  That static saved me a bunch of money.  Thank you Nintendo support.This is when I came to my senses that the system in it's current state and price point are not worth the frustration or my time. I could have troubleshot why my other 15 devices have no issue and this one does. I could have called support back.  I could have scoured the forums.  I could have walked upstairs and grabbed one of my old routers and hooked it up to see what happens.  I decided not to.  After returning it to my brother, he could complete the update just fine on his network an hour later. It could have been Nintendo's issue or my network's. All my other devices say the 1st one. Like I said, not worth the effort.I feel that it's a decent system. I also feel that it's overpriced and late to the game. I am certainly not going to give this amount of money AND time just to play 2 games. I could have been playing games on my systems that work better, cost half as much, and have many times the game selection. Remember back when Nintendo made game systems and not gimmicks? Why not just a system that hangs with the competitors with a freaking regular controller?  Why didn't they make the gamepad optional?  I hate the gamepad.  It's dumb and it has a resistive screen.  It reminds me of the early $100 android tabs except with handles.  It weighs considerably more than my Nexus 7 tab.They have THE system for one year.  I hope they take advantage of it and realease some good exclusives.  When they have 5 or more games that I'd like to play and cannot get elsewhere, I'll reconsider.  Until then, I'm going enjoy my stack of cash.  The system went back to the store.  I have never been more excited about getting rid of 'the next big thing'.NOTE: my active router is a D-Link DIR-625.  I work from home and connect to two VPN's.  I have no issues ( save the ones that everyone in my org experiences).  I have a desktop, laptop, work laptop, netbook,  2 tabs, smart phone, wii, 2 Xbox 360's, PS3, LG LM6700, Roku, WDTV player, PsVIta, and a 3DSXL that use this gateway regularly.  That's not counting my girlfriend's tab and laptop.  None of them have an issue at all.  Not the ones upstairs either.  The Wii U was about 8 feet from the router.  I also have a 16Mbps/2Mbps connection speed that is very steady.", "ok so thinks I like/dislikedislike: when you first turn on the wii u, in order to completely set up and be able to use the internet a download is required. This download is sensitive. it keeps disconnecting from server, and is very frustrating...like: The game pad is awesome, and I love that they are using a rechargeable built in battery now so that you don't have to keep replacing the batteries like in the original wii control.like: i like that you can use the game pad anywhere in the house.pre-warning = if you don't have an hdmi port don't get the wii u. it requires an hdmi port instead of the usual avrevision:I have the network figured out I think... if you keep the game pad control perfectly still it will not disconnect, or at least it didn't for me...I am still keeping this as a 4 star review for flimsy network...Revision:I have been told that if you need the hdmi port, there is a av converter cord if you search amazon or somewhere...Also, customer service said the network glitch only happens if your in the country or in an area that doesn't always have secure wi-fi... you can get it to work, but not as good... for me I live out in the country kind of... it's in the country/town part. we have cable internet, but for us to download the first download it literally took 8 hours since it kept disconnecting...I started the download at noon, and it didn't finish until about 9:30. The best thing about it though is if it stops or you turn the system off, it'll pick up were it last left off...if you have secure network you should be fine...Also, customer service told me not to put the system or the game pad around metal objects because the metal interferes with it somehow... I haven't had anything happen to mine and I keep it by my xbox and my old wii, so i don't exactly know what their talking about, but thought I'd mention that.", "\"Whats in it?Wii U 32 GB Black, Wii U tablet controller, Nintendo Land game, tablet charging stand, table regular stand, tablet charging cable, Wii U power cable, HDMI cable, Wii Sensor, Wii U stand, Deluxe Digital PromotionIs it worth the $50 to get the deluxe over the basic?I would say that all the extras more than makeup for the $50.  You'd probably be going out and buying a lot of the extras anyhow and it would cost more in the long run.  I also prefer black over white so that was another deciding factor.Where did you find it?A lot of Target's in my area get regular shipments of them.  I just called one morning and they had one and reserved it for me until I got off of work.  There's a lot of bundles out there too, I don't really think the off-brand extras that are thrown in are really worth the increased price.  Just be patient and you can find one pretty easy, and there's no reason to pay extra to those people that are just trying to price gouge since they got it early.The components themselves:- The console is pretty slick looking, backwards compatible with Wii games.  Something I noticed is there is no ethernet port so you are stuck with wireless (I usually prefer wired connections but I didn't notice any problems).- I like the tablet controller more than I thought I would.  It is very comfortable and lightweight.  The biggest complain I have read is about battery life, I don't play games a really long time and I always put it on the charge stand and haven't had any problems.  My brightness is set to 2.  It is very responsive and I haven't had any problems with it.  On some games you can even play the game solely on the controller so someone else can use the TV.- I do like black consoles over anything else but unfortunately the console and tablet controller are shiny black, being fingerprint and dust magnets.  It doesn't bother me that much but may to some people.- I really like the charging stand, it makes it really convenient to just set your tablet on and let it charge.  I don't use the non-charging stand for the Wii U tablet but I use it for my Nexus 7.  It's also worth noting that your charging stand takes your controller charger cable, so if you want to plug and play you will have to unplug it from the stand.  The Wii U console stands I don't use, I like it laying down, that's also how the logo is written.- You get this slick black console and then the power brick, controller charger, and HDMI cord are this ugly grey.  Why Nintendo why...- Nintendo Land is a decent game that demos out a lot of the ways the new controller can be used.  It's not the same awe effect as Wii Sports but worth playing around with.- Nintendo Digital Deluxe Promotion, 10% back on all digital purchases.  For details see [...]Be warned:Since the console only uses one tablet controller currently you will need your Wii remotes.  Also games like the New Super Mario Bros U (an amazing game) doesn't use the tablet as a \"\"regular\"\" controller for multiplayer.  I had a tablet and Wii remote and the tablet was only used as an overview / create helpful platforms for the other player.  To \"\"truly\"\" play two player you will need two Wii remotes.The game selection:I only have The New Super Mario Bros U and Nintendo Land- The New Super Mario Bros U is an amazing game that lives up to the Mario name.  It is like a HD Super Mario 3, that takes inspiration from every Mario created.  It is amazing and really brings you back to the old days.  I would say the console is worth it solely for this.- There are a lot of game currently out that have gotten mixed reviews or say is it really any better with the new controller.  It will take time for developers to know how to use this technology but there is a lot of promise there.  Also considering things like Xbox SmartGlass are on the horizon I can bet that it will have a similar effect as the Wii U tablet, so I think game developers are already working on new ways to incorporate those technologies.The software:As you probably already know there is a pretty large update for the console when you turn it on if you want access to any of the network functionality.  What you may not know is that each app and game also has a decent wait time while they each get updated.  Right now launching any apps like Netflix or Amazon Instant Video is a little slow.  I think this will easily be fixed with some software updates in the future.  Try not to get too upset and be patient.  I have watched a movie on Netflix and Amazon Instant Video on the Wii U and it plays fine.  The tablet incorporation is a little laggy and can be improved but again, look at any last generation console from what it looked like when it came out and what it looks like now.  That's the beautiful things about the consoles now, they can keep getting updated and be made better as we learn more.Can the Wii U hold out against the upcoming Playstation and Xbox?Nintendo always survives based on its ingenuity and its franchise games.  The truth is with so few details on what's coming it's impossible to say.  If you are a Nintendo fan then you will have no regret getting the Wii U.  Based on the past releases I would also guess that the Playstation and Xbox will be a lot more expensive.Final thoughts:If you are a Nintendo fan and love the games then this is an easy buy.  I love the console, mainly just for New Super Mario Bros U right now.  Look through the launch and if you think it's something that you want then go ahead and try it out.  If you are unsure, are satisfied with your current console, or are not really a Nintendo fan then just wait for more details to come on other new consoles.  I see for all consoles the software getting better and games changing the way we play them, the future of gaming is very exciting.\"", "I can't recommend this system enough.  The gamepad is a game changer and I hope it becomes implemented on the upcoming PS4 & XBox 720.  It truly changes the way you play games.  Beautiful graphics & sound.  Can't wait for Zelda & Metroid to come out for it.", "I really wasn't expecting much more than a Wii HD but the new WiiU has blown me away!The gamepad is awesome, I can play SMBU in my bedroom late at night on the gamepad!Miiverse is very cool and i can easily spend hours reading and replying to posts.I think another hit out of the park for Nintendo!!PS the web browser is excellent and plays videos!The only disappointing app is the  youtube one which does not use the gamepad and is very buggy, typical Google! But the browser does Youtube flawlessly.", "There are millions of American families with Wiis and many will decide to upgrade soon.  If your family loved the Wii,I strongly recommend upgrading to the Wii U when you are ready to upgrade.  Over the past year Xbox has really campaigned to attract the family gaming market; the problem is if your family was used to Nintendo Wii games, you might be disappointed with Xbox 360.  My nephews convinced their parents to upgrade from their Wii to an Xbox, now the problem for them is that the selection of great XBox games that are E or E10+ is very limited and they realized that almost all of their favorite games on the Wii were made by Nintendo.  When they came to visit us last week they fell in love with the Wii U.  We played Mario Bros Wii U and Nintendo Land for hours (these are the only Wii U specific games we own).  They are also bummed that Lego City will not be on Xbox.  I am not saying the Xbox 360 is a bad system (it is not), I am saying it is not near the family gaming system like the Wii was.The Wii U is in it's infancy and over the years Nintendo will make great games for it.  So if your family loved the Wii, when you are ready get the Wii U.", "This was my first launch system. It's also Nintendo's entrance into full HD gaming. There's a lot that could be said about this system and a lot that has already been said about it. It has good graphics, but really, doesn't everything now? It's controller doubles as a web browser so you can jump on the web in the middle of a game to find answers if you need. If anything when considering buying a Wii U, you should consider the bad things. It really is hard to find anything bad about it, though. It has a small hard drive which could turn some off if you planned on downloading all your games. You still can, but you will need an external hard drive that will run close to 100 bucks. That's all I would consider. Nintendo leads innovation. So you can count on them getting more out of the hardware than critics will admit. I don't know what else to say. If you didn't know you can trust Nintendo then I'm guessing you have amnesia or was not old enough when the NES launched and changed the way we saw video games.", "\"With so many good reviews on here already, I will be posting a very different kind of review for the Wii U.It's never easy being the new kid on the block. This is especially true in today's video game console world. Every new thing, from companies releasing their first tablet, to Nintendo releasing it's next home console. Each one gets slammed with all the same comments \"\"there's no apps, no games, it doesn't work right, etc.\"\"With pressures from both the industry and consumers, how can any company release a new product as they are expected to. If you delay the product to ensure that it works properly, you upset everyone, but if you release it early with the intent to iron out the wrinkles later, you still upset everyone.Nintendo had a lot to work on here. Not only did they release a home console with an entirely new way to experience games, but they also stepped up their online presence. MiiVerse now exists, the Wii U is capable of video chat, the eshop was available at launch, friendcodes are history, TVii is going to be awesome, the console has a much better internet browser than the Wii and 3DS, the list goes on.But, the first thing I listed was probably the most important detail of all. Nintendo has given us not just a more powerful console, but has given us a console capable of delivering a gaming experience that just can't be done on current gen hardware (and possibly not even next gen). It remains to be seen if anyone (other than Nintendo, of course) will take advantage of the game pad, or if, like the Wii, this console's potential just unfortunately goes by the wayside.Speaking of the Wii, I feel as though it was ahead of its time. Nintendo gave us a new way to play games, but no one dared touch the system simply because all that matters is GRAPHICS, GRAPHICS, GRAPHICS. Even awesome quality games like Xenoblade were hated on not because their graphics were bad, but simply because they were \"\"not HD.\"\" Never mind that they were fun and obviously had a lot of time and money poured into them.I've been playing video games for over 20 years. I've seen it all. I am bored with just playing prettier and prettier versions of the same games. This was the whole reason behind my purchasing a Wii U. It was Nintendo's next game changer, which will undoubtedly be copied by Sony and Microsoft in one way or another.Somewhere along the line, most of us became spoiled by the industry. We each expect companies to cater to each and every single one of our individual gaming needs. This is just plain unrealistic and is never going to happen. Part of experiencing the Wii U, will be being there as it grows and improves as a home console. Nintendo will undoubtedly patch the long loading times incurred by the OS (UPDATE: they've already released one such patch). They can easily release a newer tablet down the road with a beefier battery life.What a lot of us don't seem to realize is that Nintendo is one of the few video game companies out there that focuses on quality. How many Nintendo games come out that are packed full of bugs and glitches? None. But even when there is an exception, it gets fixed. Look at Skyward Sword. When I found out that the game had a game-breaking bug in it, I knew without a doubt that Nintendo would patch it. Even on a system with limited online capacities (I'm talking about the Wii), Nintendo was able to incorporate a patch into our lives that fixed the game.They will do the same thing with the Wii U. TVii is on its way. I don't doubt that the OS will be patched over time to make it run more efficiently. We just need to be patient and respectful. Trust me, we don't want to force Nintendo to change its ways. Do you really want another system on the market that is plagued with issues for the first 4-5 years of its life? I know I don't.Nintendo has been in the business for a long time. I support their decisions not to add excessive features such as a 500GB HDD or a built-in DVD player. People don't seem to understand that this $350 system would easily become a $500 system. Then people would just complain even more! Do we really need another console with a DVD player? No. Most of us already have 3-4 DVD players in our homes! Plus, you can buy your own HDD for cheaper than Nintendo can include one in the box.Why did I only rate this four stars?It would seem that, although Nintendo learned from the launch of the 3DS, they simply swapped one problem for another with the launch of the Wii U. Here's what I'm talking about:What the 3DS did wrong:-Was overpriced-No eshop at launch-Had to wait months for the first good game to come outThe Wii U fixed all those things, but created new problems:-HUGE day-one update that was required to enjoy core parts of the system-Whereas the eshop was available at launch, there's nothing to buy on it!-It's clear the console's OS could have used some more TLCThese things might not seem like all that big of a deal, but they are enough to alienate some people. Unfortunately, in today's world, it's not what you sell, but how much you sell. So, even though it pains me to admit, Nintendo needs those who don't truly understand their products in order to succeed.On a final note, Nintendo didn't have to give us a built-in Wii with the system. They merely could have said \"\"just keep your Wii's.\"\" This was another thing Nintendo did not have to do. They even gave us a way to transfer all our Wii purchases/data to our new console. Both Sony and Microsoft more or less abandoned backwards compatibility long ago.If you're like me, and you've been a fan of Nintendo since the original NES, then you understand that Nintendo is a type of innovation and quality that we do not want to lose. Trust me. While people are busying fighting over whether the Xbox One or PS4 has better graphics, I will be enjoying the experience I can only get from the Wii U.It should always be about the experience.\"", "Nintendo's next generation system, called the Wii U, is the first of the eight generation systems to release in stores. But is it worth your money? Or should you pass it up for another system?Simply put: No! Do not neglect the Wii U, just because the other systems have more power. The Wii U has so many features and upgrades to it, that you'll definitely want to try it! Let's take an examination of each of the important aspects as to what makes a console a good console:1. HardwareThe Wii U's hardware is pretty much a mixture between a PS3 and a Wii. On one hand, you have the online functionality and graphics of the PS3 and the Nintendo innovation of the Wii. The two mix very well, taking my favorite parts of the last generation's systems. Top that off with an innovative way to play games, the off-TV play, and you've got possibly the best hardware in gaming thus far!The off-TV play is much more useful than you might think. Having the Wii U for about a year now, my family and I have used the off-TV play function about as much as the normal function. It's very useful if someone wants to watch the game or their soap operas or even play another system. When someone wants to play our PS3, I can easily play Wii U while they're playing on the pad, which leads to less frustration. Sony tries to mimic this with the PS Vita, but the PS4 and Vita together cost about $400 more than a Wii U.It also comes with bonus features such as Nintendo TV and Miiverse. I want to talk specifically about Miiverse, because I think it's one of the best additions to the Wii U. Miiverse is an online community where users can talk about any games that are on Wii U. It has a strict policy that doesn't allow vulgar language or anything sexually explicit. This is especially nice for people like me who can't play online due to foul-mouths. However, I should mention that certain communities find it easier to get away with things than others.The battery life has been criticized, but I don't think it's a big deal. Though it is short, it can be plugged in and charged at any time, without it needing the system on (I'm looking at you PS3!).2. GraphicsSimply put, the graphics to the Wii U are beautiful! Their slightly better than the PS3 and Xbox 360's, but with Nintendo's talent, they outshine them significantly. NintendoLand, which comes with the Deluxe bundle, has better graphics than anything I've seen on either PS3 or Xbox 360! What took Sony and Microsoft about six years was accomplished by Nintendo in one try! Now it's true that games such as New Super Mario Bros. U don't really push the hardware's limits, but even still, games like The Wind Waker HD and Sonic Lost World show that this system contains some of the best graphics out there.3. PowerOkay, it's true: the Wii U has the power of the last two systems, while the PS4 and Xbox One have significantly more power. To me though, that doesn't matter. One of my favorite games, LittleBigPlanet 2, had almost infinite possibilities, and that was on a PS3's power. True, there were a few things that could have been improved, but for the most part, it was nearly limitless. Adding as much power as the PS4 and Xbox One does seems to be pointless. Games can't get much better. That is, unless they become more expensive. At the same time, Nintendo has won several game-of-the-year awards on Wii (which has significantly less power than the PS3 and Xbox 360). With the power of the Wii U, Nintendo seems to be even more open to making even higher quality games than before!4. GamesPossibly the most important, the Wii U's game line-up is the best of the three next-gen systems. Though it's launch line-up started a bit slow, the Wii U's line-up has been increasing with some of the most varied games out there. PS4 and Xbox One both focus more on the shooter type genre than anything, while the Wii U features shooters, platformers, racers, kid-friendly, and mature games of the like. Unlike the Wii, the Wii U features great family games like Mario and Wii Party, while also featuring mature games like Assassin's Creed and Batman. Speaking of which, the third-party support is also a lot better than it was on Wii. Not to even mention that the next Smash Bros. and Zelda are coming out soon on Wii U.I should also note that the Wii U is the only next-generation system that has backwards compatibility. I really wish that the PS4 or the Xbox One could play PS3 or Xbox 360 games. Sadly, this isn't the case. I know that the Xbox One can play 360 games if you have the 360 hooked up to it, but I'm referring to without the aid of another system. Thanks to this ability, you could download all your Wii game files into the Wii U and sell your Wii, saving you even more money.The VerdictIf you're trying to decide which of the eighth-generation systems you should get, your first choice should be Wii U. Though it might not have as much power as the other two, the Wii U just has the best amount of content and variety for the cheapest price! I'm not saying that you shouldn't get a PS4 or an Xbox One, but rather that this is probably the best option of the three.", "\"I bought the this along with new super mario u, zombie u and nintendoland. I probablly played with the Wiiu for about a week and it has been collecting dust ever since. I honestly feel like I have wasted my money on this system. I encourage everyone who reads this to not waste your money, wait a year and check back on the game library then to see if you want to buy one.Why do I save done waste your money on a Wiiu? Because every game on it you can play elsewhere. Games like new super mario is the exact same new super mario games on the ds, 3ds and wii. Games like mass effect 3 are the same thing as you probablly already played on other systems. Games like zombieu which being exclusive to wiiu is just another zombie shooting game. I played a few other games at a friends house and those were all very much \"\"been there, done that\"\". Granted it is a new system and good games take awhile to trickle out but at this point there are no must have titles. Third party support is also lacking as there are'nt many third party developers creating a lot of new content exclusive to the wii u and the majority who are seem to just be porting other games to it.I dont like the online aspects of it. Like the friend request process, the lack of universal game invites, and downloadable games being split between the eShop and Wii Channel. It is just all very user unfriendly compared to say the ps3 or a pc's online community. It still feels like nintendo is being dragged kicking and screaming into the online world.The tablet is only good for about 3 or 4 hours before it needs to be recharged. That's a horribly short amount of time considering it is supposed to be the primary draw to the system. I played super Mario for a couple hours, didn't use the system for 2 or 3 days and came back to find the tablet was damned near dead and had to be recharged.It lacks the appeal to older people and non gamers that the wii did. Couple that with the fact the Ps4 was announced it looking rather nice so far and the fact that Microsoft should be announcing their next system soon, Valve is making a steambox and tablets/phones becoming more powerful it is hard to justify buying a wiiu.I cant justify the price for what it is. A upgraded wii. There is'nt a major technological leap here. Some might argue the tablet controller is a huge upgrade but its just a normal controller with a touch screen on it that has far less resolution than most smart phones, a less responsive touch screen and less features. The system itself is in HD now but it still lags behind the much cheaper and much older ps3 and 360 in terms of horsepower. But at it's core it is still just a wii.The wiiu itself is essentially just a slightly upgraded wii and nothing more. I really didnt like holding onto that tablet for very long and since it served me no real purpose aside from a few gimmick features it was pointless to hold on it. I cant imagine playing games on it that require analog stick, it would be like holding a giant ps3 controller. It is a cool concept but no one has implimented anything into their games that makes it worth while. I also didnt care for how the controller is, it feels like its a couple generations behind the curve in its mens and interface.For graphics people its still behind what a ps3 and 360 can deliver in terms of speed and graphics quality. You can buy a ps3 and a library of games for less than the cost of a wiiu system by itself and with the ps4 launching this year I cant even begin to reccomend buying a wiiu. Now good graphics do not equal good game, they never have but if they are important to you then you'll be dissapointed.So my suggestion is if you own a wii then dont buy a wiiu. If you dont own a wii then buy one instead of a wiiu because you can buy a wii and a bunch of really great used wii games and still spend less than you did just buying a wiiu system with no games. The wiiu isnt worth the price right now due to lack of good games, maybe in a year when more have come out and so on but as of now its just lacking too much to be worth paying for a new system plus the cost of games.\"", "I've been looking forward to the Wii U for awhile now.  There's nothing quite like the feel of a new system.  I unboxed my Wii U and had no problems hooking it up.  Definitely glad I bought the Deluxe Set almost immediately because it comes with a cradle for the gamepad.  Unfortunately there is a estimated 5gb update as soon as you connect to the internet.  This will take awhile but you want to get it done.  It adds many features.  This is my first complaint.  Big first day update that took me an hour.  You can't do anything while it does this.  Afterward though I spent a good deal of time just playing around in the menus and testing out the features.  The Wii U has some wonderful potentials and it is quiet fun using the gamepad to navigate.  My second complaint is the load time for menus.  Occasionally this takes 30 seconds or more.  Not really that long, but it can feel like forever.  After I got done with the menus I figured it was time to try out an external hard drive.  It would not work with my usb powered external hard drive, but it did work wonderfully with a 2tb dedicated power source external hard drive.  Then it was time to go the the eshop and download some games.  I purchases a few games from the eshop and it took a good while to download them.  They were saved straight to the external hard drive which was nice.  While waiting I tried out the Wii Mode, which allows the Wii U to pretend it is a Wii.  No Joke.  The Wii U restarts and when it loads up it is exactly the same as a Wii.  This is quite a nice feature as I still have many Wii games I look forward to playing some more.  At the end of the day I feel I have spent my money well.  Many people have complained about the launch line-up but I think Nintendo did their homework well.  There is at least one game forever one.  Each game targets a different genre for the most part.  If you're like me and like many different genres then you're going to have a lot to play.To sum it all up the Wii U is like an upgrade for the Wii.  It does everything the Wii does and much more.  So if you enjoyed a Wii over the last few years, you'll enjoy a Wii you just as much if not more.  Though there are still a few quirks to complain about, the overall experience is rewarding.", "PS Sore & XBox Done...Do yourself a favor and purchase a Nintendo Wii U. Best system I have ever owned in 26 years.", "I own PS3,XBOX360 and the Wii, just got my WiiU and I love its an Amzing Console, cant wait for Zelda, so get it and Show your support for Gaming sake before Apple and Google destroy it for good.", "\"I got the Deluxe Wii U for Christmas, and let me say, it has not failed to amaze me. The Wii U is a wonderful console, very innovative with a revolutionary controller, and a bright future ahead of it. So let me tell you about my Wii U experience and my thoughts on the console so far. Just a warning, this is a long (but detailed) review.*BEFORE YOU SELL YOUR WII*Before you sell your Wii, THINK FOR A MOMENT. To play ANY games on the Wii U in multiplayer, you will need AT LEAST 2 Wiimotes. Yes, you can do it with 1 Wiimote and the GamePad, but that's not really all that fun. I would recommend keeping at least 2 of your Wiimotes before you sell your old Wii, or simply buy new Wiimotes, they're really cheap nowadays.*SETUP*The Wii U was set up on Christmas Eve. My dad set up the console, so I had to get the details on the setup afterwards. From what I was told, the set up went really smoothly, but the day 1 update took a couple of hours to complete. To be honest, I kind of suspected this, probably because Nintendo's servers were overloaded with people receiving Wii U's for Christmas trying to download the update. (On a side-note, my friend that also got a Wii U said that he had to wait until after Christmas Day to do the update, the servers were so loaded.) I had to sync the Wiimotes, and they synced really fast - only about 5 seconds per Wiimote.*THE CONSOLE*The Wii U itself is basically a sleeker version of the Wii. It has rounded corners, it's shinier, and only a tad bit longer and taller than the Wii. It has four USB ports (2 in front and 2 in back), an SD card slot, and all of the necessary ports needed to hook up the console. The console is also a very quiet little bugger. With no disk in it, the console barely makes a sound. And with a disk in, you can't even hear the disk quietly whirring unless you come to a silent part in whatever your doing, but even then the sound is very faint. It's nice that the console is quiet.*THE GAMEPAD*Okay, there is no doubt about it - the GamePad is revolutionary. It's exceptionally light for how big it is and although it looks clunky, it is very comfortable to hold. The controller looks very well-built. I have three younger siblings. It's been dropped. The screen, analog sticks, and buttons have been slapped out of frustration. Not a scratch has appeared on the thing yet. The GamePad was built to last. All of the buttons are firm. People claim that the analog sticks wobble around when you shake the GamePad but it's really just the stylus jiggling around in it's spot. The analog sticks are much better than the 3DS's Circle Pad, and they are clickable, although I haven't played a game that uses this function yet. The touch screen is very responsive and typing on it is quite easy (the keys are just the right size for my fingers). Don't feel like using your fingers? Whip out the stylus. The TV button on the controller is AWESOME. Simply by pressing the button, you can turn on your Wii U, TV, Cable/Satellite box, change the input, volume, and channel all from the GamePad. This is one universal remote that actually works. Nintendo TVii does have a similar remote but it has more options, however, the TV button is what you have to use to initially turn on your TV if the Wii U is not already on. That comment being said, the Wii U does NOT need to be turned on to use the TV button features. Pressing the button will simply wake the GamePad, and pressing it again will put it back to sleep. The GamePad screen, although not HD, is still very high quality (better than the 3DS). There is absolutely ZERO lag between the TV and the GamePad, and it's really quite amazing how that works. With some games (New Super Mario Bros. U, Scribblenauts, Netflix, Amazon, to name a few), it is really revolutionary how you can simply take what is being displayed on the TV and put it on the GamePad. It's just so darn simple it's amazing. I can play Mario while say one of my siblings watches a DVD. The GamePad's battery life is not stellar, but it really depends what brightness level it's at. I'd say the battery life is about equal to the 3DS's.*WII U MENU (WARAWARA PLAZA)*When you turn on the Wii U and select your user (I'll come back to this), you are greeted by all of the registered Miis on your console. The \"\"camera,\"\" so to speak, will then zoom out and you will be greeted by a horde of Miis from all around the world rushing into your WaraWara Plaza and they will all gather around a tile representing an app or game they are playing (NSMBU and Netflix are ALWAYS there). From the WaraWara Plaza, you can see the various Miiverse posts each of these Miis have posted. It's really cool how the Miis interact, such as them having a look of surprise when someone pushes past them, or the way they appear to be talking. While the TV displays the WaraWara Plaza, the GamePad displays the actual menu with all of the options. However, these two can be switched quite easily. Imagine the bottom half of the 3DS Menu on the GamePad screen with something similar to the StreetPass Plaza on the TV. Just one small detail that I really love about the Wii U.*MIIVERSE*For the first time ever, Nintendo has an online social network, called Miiverse (a pun of Mii and universe). When I explain Miiverse to a friend, I say it's \"\"Facebook for video games but better.\"\" On Miiverse, there is a different community for each game/app there is, and you can \"\"favorite\"\" a community (similar to liking a page). Within each community, you can post something regarding that game/app using the GamePad. However, using the GamePad screen and the stylus, you can draw a picture and post it to Miiverse. There are some REALLY amazing pictures on Miiverse...it's hard to believe how they can make these awesome pictures on the screen. If you go to Miiverse while you have a game suspended, you can put a screenshot of the game into your Miiverse post. I have seen this often with NSMBU - somebody will write \"\"Where is the x star coin?\"\" with a picture of them standing next to the level on the world map. Miiverse is simply revolutionary...it's a way to connect to your fellow Wii U owners, it's a way to show your love towards Nintendo, it's a good place to get help with games, the possibilities are limitless.*NINTENDO NETWORK AND USERS*In order to use the functionalities of Miiverse, you need to set up a Nintendo Network ID...sorta like your \"\"Miiverse Username.\"\" It's not a very hard process...you just have to enter the basic information that you're asked every time you register for something. YOU WILL NEED A NINTENDO NETWORK ID TO USE MIIVERSE. The Wii U is also Nintendo's first console to offer different users, similar to computer accounts. The console can have up to 12 users (which is reasonable, not many people have more than 12 people using the same exact console) and you can even password protect your user. This feature is quite useful if you have younger siblings like me and you don't want them messing around with your game data and such.*BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY*The Wii U is completely backwards compatible with ALL Wii games and accessories. When you want to play a Wii game, insert the disk and click on the \"\"Wii Menu\"\" option on the Wii U Menu. The system will then reboot as a Wii emulator. Something to keep in mind is that your Miis that you made on Mii Maker can NOT be used in Wii mode. If you plan on playing a game that requires Miis, you must make new Miis on the Mii Channel on the Wii Menu. Wii games are actually slightly up-scaled in quality when played on the Wii U...the graphics are slightly crisper and a little bit higher quality (the Galaxy games and Mario Kart Wii have never looked so good).*RANDOM OVERALL THOUGHTS*The HD is glorious. It's amazing to play Nintendo games in fully rendered HD graphics. For the first time in a long time, Mario is not pixelated at all in NSMBU. Everything is crisp and the colors are bright. The console can't play DVDs, but I'm quite sure most people out there have at least one DVD player in the house. My only (yes, ONLY) concern with this system is the slow loading times. Yes, the rumors are true - the Wii U is slow. However, some people are claiming these atrocious loading times such as 30 seconds to load a game...that is not true. It typically only takes AT MOST 10-15 seconds to launch a game. Netflix actually loads faster on the Wii U than it ever did on the original Wii. I'd say the worst offenders are Amazon Instant Video and Nintendo TVii. Amazon takes an eternity to start up (always at least 25 seconds), and the same can be said for TVii. However, Nintendo plans to release 2 system updates in spring and summer to fix the load times, so I will update this review once that happens to talk about the difference. Also, the YouTube app is absolutely pointless. You can only use it to watch videos. You can't view channels, comments, like videos, POST COMMENTS, for that matter...you can only watch videos. Might as well sacrifice the high quality on the YouTube app and watch it on the Internet Browser. My Wii U has frozen up a few times, and unfortunately the only way to unfreeze it is to unplug the system. Most of the times the system froze it was entirely the system's fault, although one time it was my fault...I confused the system in the Internet Browser. Hopefully the upcoming updates will also improve the system's stability.*FINAL THOUGHTS*Overall, the Wii U is a wonderful system. The GamePad is amazing, the graphics are top notch, but at the current time it is slow and can freeze up. But these problems are definitely going to be fixed. It has a very reasonable price for what you get ($350 for an HD console, a giant tablet controller, Nintendo Land, the charging cradle, that's a good deal!). The deluxe is definitely the better way to go but beware - black GamePad equals fingerprint and dust magnet! To conclude, the Wii U is a must-have for any Nintendo fan, and it currently has a decent lineup with more great games coming. The Wii U has a bright future ahead of it.\"", "Shortly before Christmas, I decided to take the plunge and purchase a Wii U Deluxe set.  Here, I'll discuss my experience setting the console up for the first time and follow it up with my likes and (very few) dislikes with the new Nintendo system.The night I brought my system home, I knew to expect a lengthy update and install process.  So I took my time setting the system up and I let the Wii U GamePad fully charge before the first-time setup and update.  After 2.5 hours of charge time, I proceeded with the first-time set-up, but for one reason or another I couldn't get the Wii U to connect to my home network.  It was relatively late at this time (around 10:30PM) so I gave up trying and played some Nintendo Land until I got tired.The next morning, I attempted connecting again to no avail.  So I contacted Nintendo, whom was very helpful but couldn't solve my issue.  After contacting my Internet provider and tweaking my firewall settings, the Wii U finally connected to my network and the update began downloading.Now, about the update itself... I've read all over the place all sorts of nightmare stories about the first-time update, with stories ranging from long update/install times to systems crashing or bricking.  I'm happy to say that I probably had the rare case of the update not being nearly as bad.  Not only did the update download AND install within an hour, but not once did the console freeze or crash during the process.  Hope for the best but prepare for the worst, I guess.  After the main update, there were no more connection issues, and I was able to update the on-board apps such as Netflix and YouTube.  The Nintendo Land update was sorta obnoxious to wait for, but I can't complain because unlike its predecessor, at least Wii U has patching in the first place.Console Pros/ConsPROS:-FINALLY, an HD Nintendo system!-Smoother menu interface-Ability to swap between screens;  One screen can have the menu while the other shows your MiiVerse.-Still quieter than every console available-Four USB ports, perfect for charging controllers and utilizing external hard drives-Speaking of, memory expandable with external hard drives-Compatible with all your Wii games and accessories-Transferring from Wii to Wii U is surprisingly easy-Most titles available via downloadCONS:-Slow OS (which Nintendo has said will be fixed through patches)-Not compatible with GameCube games, CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, etc.-The eShop looks boring, like it's begging for an overhaul-Dismal amount of storage space; an external hard drive is necessary if you want to download many full retail titlesGamePad Pros/ConsPROS:-Despite its looks, is very comfortable in the hands-Does not require a TV for most of the basic functionality, and even with a good amount of the games-The screen looks just as good as an HDTV-The speakers are surprisingly loud and detailed-Built-in microphone and camera-Can be used as a universal remote for your TV and cable/satellite receiver, and is arguably the best one out there-The buttons never feel out of reachCONS:-Not every game can be played with ONLY the GamePad-Battery life is obnoxiously short; third-party battery recommended when available-You'll need a second power outlet available to charge the GamePad((I'd point out the Pros and Cons of Nintendo Land, but I'll save that for a separate game review.))The Deluxe set also comes with an HDMI cable, a GamePad stand, a charging cradle, and an exclusive Deluxe Digital Promotion.  This promotion gives you 10% back (in points, of course) for every game you purchase on the Wii U eShop.  If you have an external hard drive, this is an amazing opportunity to rack up some free eShop cash.If you're looking to jump into the next generation of games with Nintendo, the Wii U is definitely an awesome console to have.  You might want to hold off if you're looking for some new games to play, but for gamers like me that have been excited about this console since its initial announcement, it's totally worth the hype.  I currently log more hours on my Wii U than my PS3.Thanks for checking out my review!", "I am a Nintendo fan, infact I love all game consoles out there, I was super excited when I got my wii u. the first one wouldn't work he next day due to the gamepad bricking. so I ordered another one. the other one works great but I only have one major problem, barely any games except first party titles are coming, Nintendo has announced a couple games for this year, like Zelda, Mario and pikmin. I will get these games but don't get any hopes for third party support. the wii u is too underpowered to play any of the 8th gen games. that means no CoD ghosts and no battle field 4 etc. only buy if your a die hard Nintendo fan and you only play games like Mario and pikmin. don't get me wrong, I love Nintendo and there games. im no Microsoft fanboy. im just a bit disappointed in Nintendo.", "\"Okay, I have this console and I really do like it. I also have an xbox 360 as well, but I am still using my xbox more than my new wii u. You could say that there aren't too many games out, or you can say this console sucks. Personally, I think this console is good, but it could have been so much better.My only real problem with this console is the gamepad. The gamepad is a cool idea for certain games (nintendo land's luigi's mansion mini game, lots of fun) but it kind of makes the tv pointless sometimes. When you turn on the wii u, you have to browse the dashboard with the gamepad, which really annoys me. I hate having to look down at this small screen when I could just look at my 52 inch hd tv.Also, I wish they had better options for controllers, yes I know the wii u pro controller is an option, but the thumb sticks on that controller is very awkward. I tried to use it for shooter games, but I just don't feel comfortable. I am a nintendo fan, always will be. But I just hate how nintendo thinks sometimes. Why release a clunky game pad controller? Can't you just make a comfortable controller like how you made the amazing gamecube controller? Those little things make me sad, but the games somewhat cancel that out for me.The first party games will be really really good. Super smash bros, and legend of zelda are the games I really love, and I know Nintendo will release quality games, reason being, they are not like Ubisoft or Activision, these two companies release games every year for profit and not for creating games that are amazing and memorable. Yes Zelda games have to bring a profit as well, but at least Zelda games are amazing in story and gameplay.Unfortunately, the third party games are weak. I know for a fact that Bethesda will not release any games for the Wii U due to the weak hardware. Xbox one and Ps4 are just plain out better consoles for 3rd party games, and you can thank Nintendo for that.If only I was there when Nintendo created the Wii U. I would have told them to make it a powerful console with at least 100gb of memory and include a controller similar to the gamecube instead of the gamepad. Sell the console for 400 instead of the 350 they started off with.  And bam they would wipe out the playstation and xbox. Nintendo would have the third party support, and the best 1st party games, but no, they went down the \"\"innovative path\"\". Ah, whatever. I recommend this console though nonetheless. It's definitely no xbox or ps4, but it is a worth console. Buy it.\"", "I got the Wii U because I started to seen games that my attention. The graphics are awesome, the gamepad is so cool and the interation level is great. I have Zombie U, Darksider 2, Super Mario HD, Nintendo Land, Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate, Just Dance 4, Lego Undercover, COD Black Ops 2, Injustice, and pretty much all the exclusive from the E-Shop and don't regret it. I also preorder all the games that where anounce at the E3 including third parties (Batman Origins, AC4, Splinter Cell, Rayman and more)This is how hooked I am with the Wii U. About space I added a 1 TB Hard drive from amazon that cost like 80 dollars so there is plenty of space. All my all downloads from the Wii where transfer and I had no issues. I recommend the Wii U to anyone, trusth me, it is a great system.", "For me, there is enough good to outweigh the bad.  Overall I really like my Wi U.  It is great to finally see Nintendo games in HD and despite having less raw power than the upcoming next gen systems I firmly believe the graphical differences will be much less than people are being led to believe.  Playing games like Trine 2 I have really been impressed with what the Wii U can do graphically.  I think that once developers hone in on the systems strengths we will see some really impressive looking games.My two biggest hang ups about the system are the lack of a Blueray player and the very small amount of on board storage.  I almost passed on the system because of this (I am glad I didn't).  I would have been more than willing to shell out a higher price tag for a Wii U that offered these features.  32GB is really pathetic, yes I can run an external HDD but I don't want to, it's messy and really clutters up my entertainment center.  One of the things I loved about the Wii U was how compact it was but after cluttering up the entertainment center with an external HDD and the gigantic controller it really isn't very compact anymore.Ultimately I purchased the Wii U to play 1st party Nintendo games in hope of a few of the better 3rd party ports making it over too (so far that's exactly what I got); although the selection may not be huge right now there are a number of great titles on the way this fall\\winter from 1st and 3rd parties and I am sure by mid 2014 I won't be able to keep up with them all.Nintendo is a company that cares about making great games and trying to bring something new to the market with the gamepad.  No it isn't perfect but it is actually pretty cool when used correctly in a game.  I like that the online play (although limited in comparison to other consoles) will be free, Miiverse is free, You do not have to pay any monthly fees or subscriptions  just to use the full system features or unlock apps.  If you're a Nintendo fan on the fence I say pick it up, Nintendo has been taking a lot of unwarranted heat in the media and online forums, yes they have made some mistakes but not enough to justify all the hate.  Mark my words, not supporting Nintendo will ultimately be a very bad thing for the gaming industry as a whole.", "This is 2012, and I spent $350 for something that is marginally more powerful than the 6 or 7 years old ps3 and xbox360.  It is a significant upgrade to the wii however.Nintendoland plays fine though, and is quite fun.  And I guess in 2 or 3 years, when there are a half dozen great Nintendo games, the wii u will be worth owning.  As it is now, I feel that I've spend $530 (wii u  + games + pro controller) for two games (nintendoland + mario).  It looks like it won't be until next christmas before there are more cool games.  :frowny face:So you really should either wait a bit to buy the wii u if you love Nintendo games, or just skip it if you don't.", "Got the console for Christmas because I loved the Wii and thought the Wii u looked intriguing. Needlessly to say this was my favorite gift by far. The numerous functions and channels will keep anyone entertained for hours. Linking itself to the TV through TVii is something I never could have imagined. The gamepad feels great and is high quality. The console is sleek and runs real well. There are a lot of great games to play on the console like Batman and Nintendoland and Assassins Creed III. The potential for future games is very high. Despite a long update time there is so much here to make any gamer happy that it holds very little weight in the long run. Highly recommend for any gamer. Nintendo does it again.", "\"I got my Wii U in the mail the day before Thanksgiving.  I was super excited.  I had read some bad things online.  I had read that the update takes around 4 hours and the battery life of the controller is short among other things.  I will tell you what I got from using the new Wii U for a bit.First, the dreaded update.  Being someone of at least average intelligence, I knew that the time in which it takes to download something on any system all comes down to the speed at which the server lets you download it, the speed at which you can download it and the size of the file.  When I read people saying 4 hours, I thought the file must be very large.  Then I read that it was 1gb.  Come on, iTunes songs are larger than that.  So, I started the download at 12:58pm and went out to do some stuff.  There were people here still, I would not leave it on if no one was home.  Anyway, I got back and looked at my clock and it was exactly 2pm.  The download had finished.  Now I can not say exactly it had taken, but I know for a fact that it was less than 3 hours.  I saw the bar before I left and it was a little bit full.  I would guess that it took 1 - 2 hours to download.  So there's that.  Anyway, if you must download the update, you either do it or you don't use the system.  People need patience.  Now I read in a review that every game you play you have to download an update.  I have Mario Bros. U and Nintendoland.  They both started downloading an update when I started.  Mario took 9 - 10 minutes.  But, I saw something on the bottom of the screen that said play game.  I was to nervous to hit it.  Later I was playing Nintendoland with my step sister and I just hit the play game button, it was just as the update had started downloading.  It told me I could install the update later.  So, while some updates may take a bit of time, it seems as though you can continue to play your game while it does so.  I thought that was a good thing.You do need to set your system up after the update.  You need to put things like your age, name and email.  This took a while.  I started at 2pm and actually did not finish until about 5:30.  This had to do with a system transfer that stopped.  More on that in a bit though.The system software.  Ok, this seems exactly like the Wii software to me.  Everything looks the same as far as image goes.  I did go to the store and it may have looked a little different.  I have not really spent much time with it yet though.  I will update when I use it more.  But everything seems to work, feel and look great.  Some were saying the new store is like Xbox 360s store or Playstation 3s.  I say \"\"so what?\"\"  I am happy with what I've seen so far.The new controller.  The new controller feels freaking great in my hands.  Everything fits and my hands did not feel cramped at all.  My step sister and I would share the controller and her hands are half the size of mine, she did not complain at all.  The screen seems to work very well.  It never missed when I hit something on the screen.  The buttons all respond fast as well.  When Nintendoland started and the character was talking to me, I actually got tears.  It is something new and exciting.  I actually found myself forgetting to even look at my TV.  Also, it told me I could set the controller up as a remote for my TV and cable box.  Normally this is a pain.  You have to look for model numbers and try again and again.  This though was the easiest it has ever been for me.  I hit the first letter of the company who makes my remote.  It is Verizon, so I hit V.  I scrolled down and hit Verizon and I could turn my cable box on and off.  As easy as that.  Same for my TV.  Took less than 20 seconds.  I was so happy with that.  You can charge your controller while you are playing games.  Just like that of the 360 or PS3.  It did not take away from the experience for me at all.  It's not like you have to move around the room when playing.Have a Wii?  Well you may want to transfer your files from it to your new Wii U.  It took a bit, but here is what you have to do.  First you have to download the transfer software on your Wii U.  Then you must but the software on an SD card with at least 512mb of space.  Then you put that card in your Wii.  You then download the software on your old Wii system.  Then you put the memory card in your Wii and it transfers everything that can be transferred onto the card, thus erasing it from your Wii.  When finished, you put the card into your Wii U and everything is put from the card onto your Wii U.  The things that took the longest while I was home in front of the TV was this.  I had saves and games on the card.  I just did other things while it was in progress.  It actually said error once and told me to re do the transfer.  I did so and the second time it worked fine.  This is why it took so long.  You do get to watch a cool animation while it happens and the music or sound coming from the controller is very zen.  So if you want to put stuff from your Wii to Wii U, no worry.  It is very simple and only requires you to follow simple on screen instructions.  You can not transfer the thing that allows you to take polls though.  There were some other things I could not transfer over as well.  It's alright, I can just go back to my Wii for that.Speaking of Wii, have some Wii games?  The ones I tried play on the Wii U worked fine.  I am not sure if they all will, but mine have.  What you have to do is switch from the Wii U, to the Wii software.  You do this by tapping on the Wii icon on the main screen.  It turns the system off, and when it comes back on, it looks like the Wii menu.  Though the Wii U menu looks like that as well.  It is very easy to switch games.Saving your game.  Well, I got the 32 gig system.  When I read online about how the Wii U would allow an external HD up to 2 tb, I was excited.  I emailed Nintendo and they told me that they recommend an external HD with a usb cable and a A/C adapter.  So I got a Western Digital 2tb drive.  I plugged it in and it formatted for the Wii U.  It took less than 15 seconds.  Now it is part of my Wii U.  You must plus it in before your plug your Wii U in and can not unplug it.  I have not seen anything on the games I've played that says saving.  But the saves are there.  Very cool.  I am not sure the size of all the games, movies or whatever else.  But I am almost positive 2tb of space will be all I need for the Wii U.  The drive cost me $149.99.  I had $20 credit to best buy so that was good.  I know some may be saying that that adds to the cost of the Wii U and they would be right.  But, external hard drives are so inexpensive now.  you could get a 250 gig drive for a very low price.  Even if you know nothing about computers, I do not believe you will have a problem setting the drive up.Ending thoughts.  I am very happy with and excited about the Nintendo Wii U.  I can see so many great things that could happen with it.  Imagine a game that could teach kids math.  They could watch the screen to take the lessons, then actually take tests using the gamepad.  Very cool.  I want to try Rockband with the thing.  I think it would be cool to have a racing game or a flying game.  You could have the TV screen just with the action and use the new Wii controller as your hud or your mirror.  That is exciting to me.  RPGs, puzzles, shooters, action and survival horror.  There seems to be so much more you can do with something like the Wii U.  I am happy the other systems will be a few years off so I get time to really enjoy the Wii U.  I look forward to the updates and features that will be available as well as the already great games that I own.  Whether you want the 8gig or 32 gig system, and no matter what size HD you get, I believe the Wii U will offer fun, excitement and something new for the entire family to enjoy.  It is one of the best purchases I have ever made.  Now please excuse me why I go actually play Mario for the first time.A couple things I thought I would add.  First, the 32 gig system comes with a stand.  The stand is great.  You can only put the two pieces in the spots meant for them.  The feel solid and safe.  Second, I have had the system on for a couple hours.  It does not feel hot at all.  The back left may feel a little different than the rest, but the system is not hot at all.\"", "Having been a student for many years, the Wii U is the first console that I've ever pre-ordered.  Now I've got a job that has something resembling a salary.  Having gotten so many years of fun and excitement out of my first-gen Wii, I decided to roll the dice on the Wii U by pre-ordering the 32 GB black deluxe set.  So far, I'm glad that I did.  This is a review of the Deluxe set that I've ordered specifically, however you can compare the two sets and fill in the blanks concerning what you may be missing with the basic setWhat is (and isn't) included:The black deluxe set comes with (almost) everything that you need to get started.  It comes with the black console, power brick, sensor bar, HDMI cable (if you need component you'll have to pick it up separately), stand, tablet, tablet charger and dock, a plastic stand for the tablet, and the packaged-in game NintendoLand.  What the game does not come with is one or more wii remotes.  If you already have a Wii, you'll be able to use your current remotes.  If you don't have wii motion plus enabled remotes, you will need to pick up a set of wii motion plus dongles in order to use them (at least for the game I've tried, which I will get into later).Setup:Set up is pretty easy, although you may have to wait a bit (at least close to release day).  Setting up the tablet controller, wires, internet, etc. was a breeze.  Internet setup was standard.  The system recognized the HDMI connection and selected the correct resolution and aspect ratio immediately.  Yes, you now have the ability to play the new Wii games in HD like the rest of the world ; )  I understand the cost reasons related to the SD choice on the Wii, but for most Nintendo fans these days I suspect that the upgrade is going to be a nice change of pace.Before playing any games I can tell that I'm going to like the tablet a bit.  Even during set-up you can tell that the tablet is well integrated with the overall use of the system.  At times the tablet display mirrors the TV content, and at others you see something different on the tablet screen while you are working.  The resolution, colors, and refresh rate of the tablet are all rather pleasing on the eyes.  The screen is touch sensitive, allowing you to interact with the tablet and games with both a press of the screen and the press of a button.  Hidden away in the back is a stylus, which is a nice touch.  I like being able to keep the screen clean while I'm playing with it.One word of warning: You may want to bring a book along (at least at first)--the initial setup required two downloads to be made over the internet.  The first was for the system itself, and the second was after I inserted the first game.  The tablet showed the progress bar while the initial update was downloading, and it took at least 15 minutes for me to see any real progress.  I switched to another activity for a while and eventually came back when the tablet alerted me that the download was finished.  This is most likely going to be an early adopter problem--I suspect since today is the release date that Nintendo's servers are getting slammed.Once setup is complete you're greeted by the Wii U main screen.  While the 3D organization is different from the Wii, you should figure out navigation fairly quickly.  One of the options is a standard Wii view, which appears to give you access to the original Wii OS for navigation and applications (very cool, I look forward to figuring out how to port over my apps and data from my old Wii).Just like the original Wii, you create Mii avatars.  This time you can use the tablet controller's built-in camera to create them for you.  After selecting hair and eye color, you can snap a shot of yourself.  The system configures several miis for you to choose from.  It automatically recognized my glasses, and gave me an option to add my full beard to my mii (making avatar selection much quicker than before).If you choose, you can also set up the tablet as a RF remote that controls all of the other devices in your media center.  This is a nice feature, and is quick to configure.  I selected my TV brand (Vizio), and the first remote configuration that I tried worked right out of the box.In order to use many of the Wii U's features you'll need to create an ID for the new Nintendo Network.  This in turn requires you to configure (among other things) a unique ID (that it says you cannot change), regional info, birthdate, etc.  If you are uncomfortable providing this information you may have to limit the features that you're able to use.  Personally, I don't care so it isn't a problem (they don't need phone, SSN, or anything that I felt was terribly invasive).NintendoLand & first impressions of gaming experience:The packaged-in disc for NintendoLand seems to serve the same purpose as Wii Sports did for the original Wii--to demonstrate how to use the features of the new system and show the user how to use the system's hardware and software.  While Sports was ultimately very simplistic in graphics and purpose, it ended up being a lot of fun for most Wii users.  Despite its relative simplicity, NintendoLand has a very similar feel, and it may be enjoyable for some time to come.In NintendoLand you are greeted by Monita, a floating screen with a single arm.  Monita shows you around the NintendoLand system, and introduces you to the tablet's controls as well as the mini games that are available to you.  Mini games include fan favorites such as Metroid, Link, Mario, Yoshi, Pikmin, and several others.  Despite the fact that I've already picked up two other games (which I will review later) my wife and I have been playing NintendoLand for several hours.  It is a lot of fun.  The interaction with the wii plus remote and nun chuck are (not surprisingly) very similar to the predecessor system, so I'm not going to go to deep into those features here.The tablet provides a real gem here.  Various games have different requirements--at least one tablet, at least one remote, just remotes, remotes and tablet, etc.  Multiplayer games that include both remote and tablet (for at least two users, of course) are a lot of fun.  No longer are you restricted to just one view on the TV or a split-screened view used in previous systems.  Now one user can use the TV as a primary display while the other user can use the mobile screen of the tablet as well as the larger display of their TV.  Simply put, the table offers exactly what you would expect--a combination of the benefits of a handheld with the benefits of a full console experience.  It is simultaneously interesting and difficult to describe without trying it.I've got to say, NintendoLand's combination of remote and tablet make me excited for future games.  I have a feeling that we're just scratching the surface of what the combo can do.  Hopefully game makers use their imagination and provide a new and unique gaming experience the same way that the Wii remotes changed the way that we view console I/O in the previous generation.As a whole, NintendoLand is a great game offering firsts person shooter, puzzles, and more.As a media center:One of the things that Nintendo seems to be trying to do with the new system is tie together the media center the same way that the Wii did seemingly by accident.  The tablet serves as a remote for your devices, the system gives you the ability to play games, and the system also comes preloaded with the biggest streaming players: Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu. I have currently tested the Netflix application and it seems to work quite well.  Otherwise, they do exactly what you would expect.  As a streaming player, the Wii U works just fine and the tablet controller (again) makes for a great remote.Overall:If my 5 star rating doesn't speak for itself, I am definitely excited by the prospects of this new system.  As far as I can tell with my initial interactions, Nintendo may have hit another home run.  This last statement is worth qualifying, because as far as I can see all of the potential of the predecessor is here--it will just be a matter of Nintendo and other game makers living up to that promise.  I can't wait to see what else the WIi U has in store for the future.  (Especially the not-yet-deployed TVii feature.)", "\"As I progress in playing the Wii U I will update my review so it might lose stars or not.  So I just picked mine up a few hours ago since I had it on preorder from Best Buy.  Don't get me wrong I kinda went through the motions of cancelling my preorder since I had no intention of really getting the console, but just in cast I did decide to preorder.  Its odd a lot of people I tell I have a Wii U most people don't know what it is.  They ask if its a add on to the Wii.  I have noticed that the reviews on Amazon aren't really flooding in like most popular items do.Now a little back story and explanation of myself.  I will justify my purchase to you the consumers.  All these comments are to help you become engrossed and in love with my review.  Is it gonna be worth that $350 clams I payed or in my case over five hundred for everything such as games and controllers.  If I have learned anything when it comes from consoles I have started opting for the accidental protection plans or whatever its called I just put on my bill.  All that considering I have been through 3 PS3's and 3 360's.Personally I am still happy with my Wii and so are my kids.  I have always had a soft spot for Nintendo since I grew up in the 80's.  Though lately I do feel they have become almost Disney in appearance but the substance is a bunch of business men in suits.  Of course their is nothing wrong with that but as I have gotten older the magic has disappeared.  I no longer think Shigeru Miyamoto is a fantasy character created by Nintendo.  In my thirties now with my own kids I started thinking about the games that would probably come like Zelda, Mario, Mario Kart, Kirby and all those games Nintendo is known for and it really helped influence me.  I remember being small and opening those Nintendo packages starting with NES World Class Track Meet bundle.  Of course I had an Atari and Sega but always had a Nintendo for better or ill sometimes.  Playing Nintendo kind of takes me back to when games were just games and made you wanna smash the controller but it was all in fun and innocence.First off I think this is not that big of a leap from what I have seen and in my mind its probably a four year or so life cycle maybe less.  I think the HD should of been in the Wii but that's o.k. since I enjoyed it with my kids in SD.  I am not some childish fanboy by the way I play PC, 360, PS3, Solar Eclipses and Eggo Waffles so I enjoy it all and love the experience each bring.  My kids though are who will love this the most since they kept the Wii going and from collecting dust.  I have read some reviews on here and I roll my eyes like a teenage girl with two sentence reviews or the obvious people.  As far as me by myself I don't think I would buy it this quick if I didn't have kids.  My kids didn't ask for it but that goes to my Nintendo side of always owning a Nintendo something console.  I think people my age understand that spot in their hearts for Nintendo.  I am gonna review this objectionable as I can since I don't really hate Nintendo but I am not their biggest fan.So to the system itself the aethetics on it are pleasing to the eye though its just a big black rectangle and about the same size as the Wii but a little wider.  Personally its not that great looking but the game pad is the real draw and I think it looks fantastic.  It does fit weird in my hands but nonetheless its a eye pleaser.  That's just my eye and good god (no offense) it has so many finger prints on it right now and I have only had it for a couple of hours.  Everything about this black model just collects it like it was at a petting zoo.  Set up is a cinch and I had it all connected in about five minutes or less.  Syncing was no problem at all either and it recognized the handset almost immediately so as far as I can tell its been smooth.  It does come with HDMI which is great instead of me getting home with component or s video cables and becoming Hulk like in anger.  I did notice the controller is pretty light and does feel somewhat like it could withstand a drop.  That is probably the one thing that worries me is my kids having it on their laps and forgetting its there than having it hit the floor as they stand up.  For some reason it reminded me of a lighter version of a Sega Game Gear though as far as size.  I might be remembering wrong though.  Time will tell if it will be a hindrance or a welcome addition to gameplay.  It does have the sensation of having something new and special to play with.  That really didn't sound right but it does.As far as memory I don't think I need as much as whats in this system but its welcome.  I have a 8gb 360 from awhile back and only recently filled that up.  Since I don't have a good internet connection all those extras don't matter much to me such as the apps like Netflix and the such.  Considering my others do that I don't really feel that I need it anyways.  I do enjoy playing older games though so I am interested what is gonna be offered on here.  50 bucks wasn't much for the upgrade to the bigger system so that also swayed me a little plus it came with a game.  If you plan on quite a bit such as streaming or downloading a bunch of stuff opt for this model.  I think a lot of people will be happy with the 8.Now this is the rub and this will show me who actually read my review with all the unhelpful votes and all the comments saying \"\"wait you reviewed it without playing it\"\".  Most these helpful and unhelpful numbers are irrelevant to the review since its obvious most people don't read them completely.  Oh and console wars cause console erections so they all come out of the wood work with their input.  Anyways as I said this will be a progression probably over a week for me to get a good review so I wanted to get it started while it was fresh on my mind.  Because reviews tend to get buried here on Amazon.  Right now it is updating that behemoth update and I hope this is the big one.  I don't have a hard line internet connection and am using a tethered VZ Wireless Droid Razr Maxx with 4g.  Its been going about two hours and is almost half way there.  I have read about peoples power cutting off mid or so through and bricking the console so my hopes are that won't happen.  My internet did cut out and it started back where it left off no problems and no starting over.  You can skip the update but eventually if you are connected to the internet you might as well do it.  I could of waited for the update to finish to write my review but I wanna make sure everything is up and running when I finish this long winded, horrendously drawn out, absolutely unnecessary, brain numbing review, big and stuff, kaboom.Though I know most people have not read this far since as of now it says 2 of 9 found it helpful and no one stopped to criticize.  I think people need to stop just look at stars and actually taste the substance.  Dip your finger in and give it a taste since no ones looking at this dinner party.  Don't be afraid to peek at the writing it aint gonna get you. Reviews are usually personal unless its those ridiculous fake ones from fanboys or the non.  Don't worry my review isn't gonna come back and get you in your dreams.  Anyways if you have questions or anything you want me to look into for you I will have no problem doing it so just let me know.So after my update is now finished I finally got to play the new Mario Wii U but of course after a update and I can tell it will be a family favorite.  The graphics really shine on this and its great to see Mario in HD and my kids are fighting with each other.  Nintendo you've done it again not only to bring families together but rip them apart.  I am enjoying using the handheld (honestly I have no clue what its called, maybe a tablet) as being the god hand in games like Mario.  We have yet to try Nintendo Land which is the game it came with.  We just couldn't resist Mario.One thing I noticed that the release titles I have pretty much played besides a couple already on other systems.  The first party games are usually what I think of the most when I think of Nintendo.  That's also a failing for me since I game on other systems, what third party support is gonna be here for me and why pick it over other systems.  Honestly other than family enjoyment I don't think I would own this console.  When my kids go to sleep odds are I will be burning up my other consoles playing more adult games.  Hopefully there will be many in the future of this console.  Another thing I did notice was they didn't go with any achievements which I find disappointing but freeing in a way.  I like them since it gives you something to earn for playing and getting points for no reason except to show off.As far as speed I noticed there were long load times such as when you are loading a game or changing menus on the Wii menu.  If you are use to blazing fast speeds from a iPad or a PC you may be in for some disappointment.  Its really not that noticeable but if you are into specs you will notice.  When you have to change menus there is also a pause for a few seconds.  My old Wiimotes synced with no problems at all and I haven't read the instruction manual yet so starting is relatively easy.  So far I am sticking to five stars with the console as is since I have yet to have a big problem and it really is fun.Next I will go into detail of my transferring my old Wii data to this U.  It is quite simple to do and it just involves a few steps of swapping your SD card back and forth and getting the transfer utility from the Wii Store.  Honestly its easy and all you have to do is consult your user manual or the internet since its got a wealth of info.  Really some of these reviews on here also have details.  I am disappointed that though I have money in my wallet I can't use it for my Wii U purchases.  I think its because I no longer have my subscription id or whatever its called for my Wii.  I tried to remember it all and the only offer they have is to find your password after you put in your user i.d. which I have no clue what it is.  So no usage of my Wii profile on the U just yet but hopefully I'll figure it out.The Nintendo Land game that's included is an absolute joy for the kids to play.  Usually I am holding the gamepad in my hand and my kids are the ones using the controllers.  There are around six muliplayer mini games and six or so single.  As far as enjoyment for me it really came from my kids playing the Mario hide and seek type game or the Luigis Mansion.  The game itself I probably would only rent but since it came with the console it shows off some potential for the gamepad.  I do recommend playing it since it does show off what opportunities come from playing with family.  These mini games will no doubt keep children entertained for hours on end I think.  Nice addition to come with the black console.I will update this review as I progress and the Wii U  grows on me.  I am wondering how multiplayer, third party, voice communication and other console norms will progress on this system.  Third party was very weak on the Wii which worries me.Though I am gonna go ahead and write my concluding sentence and it will sound like this that in conclusion the Wii U is a very enjoyable console and like its predecessor it will bring hours of fun.  Hopefully there will a larger following of the hardcore gaming crowd.  The price point is hefty but consoles don't really come out often so its up to the individual to decide whether this system will serve its purpose with them.  Put away that purchase of 350 dollars in shrimp and get this if you are convinced that its the next best thing to Skynet.  Personally its very intuitive to look at and use which leaves me to wonder what the future will hold for this system.  You can have confidence in buying this if you are into the first party games since Nintendo will in time unleash those.If your family was all about the Wii than there's really nothing wrong with this purchase.  If you are a hardcore elite gamer or whatever you call yourselves you may not find much here currently.  So wait if you want to see how the future pans out or get it now and start enjoying it for Christmas.  As for me the three stars is what I stick by for now and will change as the console progresses.  I don't really see how you can write a one time definitive review at the start of a console anyways.  Believe me five stars for fun but to me the console will have to be seen to whether or not its future shines bright for the almighty five stars overall.\"", "\"Great News.  Today (4/30/2013) Nintendo released an update that resolved a lot of the problems that the Wii U had.  My personal favorite is that you can now download and install games in the background and fully automatically.  Yes, it should have been like that since the beginning.  Three cheers! I've updated my review to reflect this new information.-----------------Original review (edited due to improvements by Nintendo):I remember that Nintendo came under a lot of criticism for not having an HD version of the Wii.  HD was around when the first Wii came out, and a lot of people were a bit skeptical that they stuck to the lower resolution.  As HD became common, Nintendo told fans that they had to do something \"\"more\"\" than just come out with an HD version of the Wii.Well, thats just what Nintendo did.  The Wii U is more than \"\"just Wii HD\"\".  But Nintendo hasn't changed the Wii experience very much.  You still use Wii remotes every time you play.  The Wii U is not \"\"completely different\"\" like the Wii was when it came out.  The Wii U is the Wii's younger, smarter brother.  And if you liked the Wii, you'll like the Wii U.The 3 main features of the Wii U are:1) Its HD, which brings it (finally) up to speed with the Xbox and Playstation ... and everything else out there.2) The Wii U has a single video controller.  The video controller opens up new game experiences.  Whoever is playing on the video controller sees something different than the other players.  For generations people have wanted multiplayer games that didn't use a \"\"split TV screen\"\", and the Wii U gives you that in one console.  This is a really big deal.  The video controller is also a touchscreen which you use to flick something at the screen, or move things on screen.  The new video controller allows for new control options ... just like the \"\"Wii balance board\"\" allowed Nintendo to sell yoga and ski games.3) Videos, videos, videos.  Netflix, youtube, TiVo, amazon instant video.  It will keep track of the TV shows you want to watch, and when they will be on.  You'll also be able to use the Wii U as a social outlet to chat about TV shows and movies.  Nintendo calls this Wii TVii, and it would be a revolution in TV watching... if only all the features were available now.  So you can use the Wii U as a control for all your Video experiences with your TV.  The video controller will act like \"\"PIP Picture in Picture in the palm of your hand\"\".  I use the Wii U with Amazon Video to watch movies for free, and the Wii remote lets me see information about the movie on IMDB WHILE the movie is playing.  For sports, you'll be able to watch instant replays on the small screen... while the rest of your buddies continue to watch the big game on the main screen.  So its going to be a remote controller on steroids.  To be honest, this is going to be a really big big deal but since not all the features roll until \"\"later\"\" I can't give the WIi U a star for it yet.  Maybe it will change your life, maybe not.  Time will tell.And that concludes the main appeal of the Wii U.  We finally get HD, the video controller adds a new dimension to the usual Wii gaming, and it also serves as a \"\"TV command center\"\".FAQ:::Some people have asked me about the Wii U, and the short answers are:1) No, you don't have to own a Wii to have a Wii U.2) You can only use ONE video controller with your Wii U.  All other players use the old Wii remote.3) 5 people can play at once, making it even more of a \"\"game party\"\" console than before.4) You can't play DVDs or Blu Ray discs.  Blue Ray is Sony Playstation territory, as you probably know.5) You can surf the internet on it (why would you want to?  I don't know)6) Should I get the deluxe?  Probably.  You get 32gb of memory, which will become more important the longer you have the console, and the more you do with it.  You get the Nintendo Land game.  You get the cradle for charging the video gamepad.  And until 2014 they will give you a store credit of 10% every time you make a purchase of digital content (games).  If you buy digital content regularly, you might \"\"earn back\"\" the extra $50 you pay for the deluxe Wii U.  (I tried this yesterday, read below for more info on the credit)NintendoLAND:Nintendo Land has a nice set of games that introduce you to life with the video controller:1) Some of the games are a lot of fun.  The most popular minigames in our house are the game where one player pretends to be a ghost and scares other players.  This is accomplished by having two screens, the ghost can see everyone, but nobody else knows where the ghost is.  This is always a howling good time at our house.  The Mario hide and seek works the same way and is also popular with us. (update: after a month of play, the Kids now play Zelda and Metroid the most)2) Some of the games would be worth about $1 in an \"\"app store\"\". (race game, balloon game, and yoshi game: I'm talking to you!)3) Some games have more than one control scheme.  The Pikmin game is enjoyed by my 4 year old because he can use a stylus to direct \"\"Captain Olimar\"\" instead of the joysticks/d-pads.  He just points at what he wants to do.  So for the first time even my youngest can join in on at least some of the action.4) Metroid and Zelda show off what the Wii U can do for multiplayer combat/FPS. In Metroid, the player with the video controller operates a \"\"helicopter\"\" while everyone else are \"\"ground troops\"\".  The two screens allow for different perspectives in battle.NintendoLand has satisfied my kids for a whole month, but its really starting to wear off now.  NintendoLand is particularly good if you have a lot of friends come over to your house.  But, its just a variety game and not very deep.  You'll probably want to buy another game shortly after buying the Wii U.  (PS I bought Trine2 from the Nintendo eShop for $20, but, I think it was worth about $10.)Other games: since I wrote my original review, I have bought a lot of other wii U games.  However, I'm generally disappointed in the use of the video controller.  In many games, the video controller either shows you a map of the area, or, shows a version of whats on the big TV screen.  Party games, like the Rabbids game and Nintendo Land, make the best use of the video controller.  Single player games tend to make the worst use of it.  I don't have all the games for the Wii U, but, thats been my general experience.The Wii U has a host of \"\"lesser\"\" features:1) A person can play the Wii U without having the TV on.  Expect a smack on your head if you want to play ZombiU while your wife watches a movie.2) Its backwards compatible with all older Wii games (but maybe not dance pads!), which is nice if you bought Zelda Skyward Sword this summer.3) Just as with the old Wii, you can download games from the Nintendo store.  If you buy online content for your iPhone, Xbox, or PS3, you know that this is a big deal.  I used to buy songs for guitar hero to add to the songs that came in the box.  If you buy this DELUXE version, you get a 10% credit back for all online purchases, see more about this credit in \"\"The Bad\"\" below.4) The Wii U video controller is like a universal remote.  You can turn on your TV and change the volume from the gamepad which is a convenience.5) Most of the old Wii hardware is compatible too, which is nice, EXCEPT that round \"\"gamecube style\"\" connector is not present on the Wii U.  Games that use a mat like \"\"outdoor challenge\"\" and \"\"Dance Dance Revolution\"\" become history in your house.6) There is a big, easy to find \"\"download again\"\" button for all digital content, so if your Wii U got fried by a power surge you wouldn't lose your purchases.  That's always nice.The bad:1) The menus aren't intuitive.  There are two menus... the Wii U menu and the Home menu.  The Home menu is found by pressing the Home button.  Note that now that downloads are automatic, the unintuitive menus aren't so bad.  But they still seem redundant.2) Transferring data from the Wii to the Wii U should be easier.  In particular I didn't like that when I imported my Miis, I had to do a separate step on the Wii U before I could actually use them in the games.  The day I got it the patch took way too long to download and install, and after I transferred my data from my Wii I felt like I had spent 2 hours on the whole thing.  But, since then, there has been no problem.3) Freezing.  I did have a problem with NintendoLand locking up, but, that went away after one day.  This will be something they fix and becomes a thing of the past.  I wouldn't sweat it.4) Long updates.  I feel that the time that it takes to download stuff and install it has improved over time.5) Installing downloaded content.  I wrote a long rant about how annoying this was, but as of the most recent update you can buy items in the store and they download and install automatically, as they should.6) Digital Content 10% back has a $50 minimum, and I feel that its high.  For every $50 in digital content you get a $5 credit.  If you spend $65 on digital content, then you still get $5, until you spend another $35 to get it to $100.  You go to a separate website using your computer, and log in, and then copy the code onto a piece of paper.  Then you go to your wii u and put in the code.  I've become accustomed to the process and I've decided its not very restrictive, but I still wish that credits just \"\"appeared\"\" in your account 24-48 hours later.  The codes are good until 2015.  The codes remain on that website even after you've used them, they don't disappear.  When you add the codes to the eShop there is no expiration date.Ok now that I'm done complaining...Your decision matrix:1) If you still like playing on your Wii, and you have the money to spend, buy a Wii U and sell your Wii.  You'll enjoy it.2) If you are considering between an Xbox+Kinect and a Wii U, I think its a tough call.  I really like the \"\"second screen\"\" gaming, it really opens up a lot of possibilities.  But most of the wii U stuff looks really juvenile.  The kid down the street told me he still wanted an Xbox because the Xbox has games for teenagers.  I said \"\"whatev.\"\"3) As a side note, every kid who has seen and played our Wii U in the last two weeks has put this as the top item on the Christmas list.  Its the \"\"next big thing\"\" for them and you can be sure that the little things that I complain about in this review won't matter to them.  Not at all.Games:  Nintendo now has decent amount of digital content to buy online.  I paid .35 for \"\"kirby's great adventure\"\" or something like that.  Its a grainy looking old game, but it was only thirty five cents.  Nintendo has started offering games at the $2, $5, and $8 price points as well.  I'm VERY pleased to see this, because I want to be able to log into the shop and grab a game for cheap when I want to.I rate this item 3 stars out of 5 because three stars means \"\"it's ok\"\".  Nintendo has made a lot of improvements in 6 months, and while they have fixed most of the problems with the system, I find myself reluctant to raise the review to 4 stars until some more exclusive games are released.  Pikmin 3 has been delayed until August, for example.1 month UPDATE:We've become \"\"heavy users\"\" of the Wii U.  My wife, who always preferred the Kinect, has started to warm up to the Wii U.  But I think its because my son is converting her, I sure couldn't.Big negative: CRADLE and battery have limitations: The battery on the video controller can't hold up to extended play.  I picked up one of these cables:Global Game Gear GGG0040 Deluxe Split Extension Cable for Wii U Video Controllerwhich resolved my problems.  Now its easier to keep the video controller charged.  I've removed my rant about the video controller battery not lasting.DOWNLOADS:  I removed my rant about problems with downloads because its been fixed.The Wii U is getting better.  I think it may turn into my favorite console of all time, if they can just get some good exclusive games out, and improve the use of the video controller in those games.  I really don't want another game where the Wii U video controller shows a map.  Gimmie a break.\"", "I'm a huge Nintendo fan. With that out of the way I will admit that they had a rough start.Even when the 3DS went through a drought I still turned it on almost every day to play. Lots of built in software and a great streetpass feature.The WiiU has been a different story. The web browser is by far my most used feature as of today.The browser is top notch and faster than my phone, computer and maybe even a tablet. It's smooth and just a great experience plus it plays Youtube bids and you can put them on the tv while you surf the net on the pad.The Wii backwards compatibility is mostly great with some bad.Most games look better than they ever have before. Nintendo says they aren't upscaled but the fact that the signal is going through HDMI means that you get the imagine digital not analog.No loss of quality, plus it's not stretched to fit a fake widescreen and the colors just pop off the screen. Mario Galaxy has a almost HD look on the WiiU with it's amazing colors, sharpness and clarity.On the bad side most game don't fit the widescreen completely and a few games have weird scan lines or just don't show any improvement at all.Another great feature is Miiverse. It's Nintendos version of facebook. It's a really cool feature. Each game has it's own section and even communities for games like Zelda and Mario. Lots of great fan art and comments and it's pretty well monitored as well. Once it's available on the computer and phone i'll be even better.Face chat is neat but less useful for me at least. Google maps and neat and fun to play around with.It comes with Netflix, Amazon, and Youtube. Netflix is actually great. A resent update did wonders for the black and whites and colors. It doesn't look wash out like it did at launch. Plus the WiiU is super quite. My PS3 sounds like a jet engine which is really really annoying.Amazon Video has great picture quality but it's really really slow to move around using the pad since it loads all the info on the pad and there is a delay. netflix does this as well but it's much faster.Youtube app sucks. Luckily you can use youtube on the browser and works great.The Nitendo shop is great. Loads fast, background loading and so far the shop has a lot of hidden gems that just aren't getting enough attention. Demos are starting to roll in at a nice clip too. Big big big improvement from the wiiware stuff. Lots of sales too. Virtual console games like Fzero and punchout for 30 cents lately. Good stuff.Menus are painfully slow but will be updated. The 3DS was slow too and the xbox blades at launch were terrible as well. Who remembers that now? So yes its a negative and yes i'm going through it right now but in a years time no one will care once it's updated.The biggest issue right now is just the lack of games.Technically it has great games. Batman, Assassins creed, Mass Effect, Call of Duty*, Need for Speed, Mario U, ZombieU, etc.I mean the system has games but the problem is most of those games are ports. I had already bought them on the 360 or they can be found cheaper there. If you never owned a 360/PS3 or got around to buying them then it's great for you.The system it's a lot of fun and packed with potential but games is the gas that makes it go and right now it's on E. I'm hoping the drought is like the 3DS where the games start rolling and it's off to the races from there.", "first of all even though this console may not be as technically or graphicly advanced or whatever compared to the ps3 or xbox, this system is very fun and in time it will have many incredible games and sell very well just like the nintendo 3ds is, Just be patient. Also i doubt that the next gen playstation and xbox consoles that are about to come out will be successful any time soon due to the fact both consoles will very likely be too damn exspensive for many people to be able to buy anytime soon. not many people can afford to pay 600 or 700 dollars or more to buy a video game console and dish out another 60 or 70 dollars or more to buy a game along with the console. those new next gen consoles will fail upon release because of that. So sony and microsoft trolls need to get off of thier high horse and stop bashing nintendo so much because the joke will be on them when the wii u starts to outsell thier new and beloved playstation and xbox consoles just like the 3ds continues to outsell the vita. Nuff said", "I love my WiiU, I love seeing it mature as a platform as well. Im looking forward to the next 6 years.It's really got everything I need from a gaming standpoint. Well almost. I'd love to see it become Japan's go to device for console gaming like the 3DS is.", "First off, I'm not a gamer, my husband and my daughter are extreme and extreme wanna-be, respectively, gamers. At best, I'm a casual, once in a while, pull my teethe out and step on my toes gamer. I generally have very little patience for video games. However, this system is just amazing. My daughter can play her games while I watch Judge Judy...amazing. I even played Nintendo Land with them and I actually had a blast. The whole family had so much fun. We played Scribblenauts, and I didn't have a controller, again, not a gamer, but I had so much fun just calling out items to add to the game. We created a purple fire breathing dragon and a super baby. I'm rambling because I love this console and would not hesitate to recommend it to others. We have 3 x-boxes, a PS3, Wii and various other entertainment devices, but the Wii u is my new favorite."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.030691079795360565, 0.04695981368422508, 0.001246191095560789, 0.016533365473151207, 0.0836658775806427, 0.017101803794503212, 0.06003565341234207, 0.023815341293811798, 0.0007350284140557051, 0.0036518911365419626, 0.04410071671009064, 0.0008491835906170309, 0.026489749550819397, 0.04556195065379143, 0.05243741720914841, 0.05206315219402313, 0.012471608817577362, 0.016026422381401062, 0.00897107645869255, 0.0009062861208803952, 0.025648344308137894, 0.033888548612594604, 0.04038657993078232, 0.02400316298007965, 0.01221732422709465, 0.0067525277845561504, 0.05577272176742554, 0.03455999866127968, 0.10455731302499771, 0.04831431806087494, 0.0295404102653265, 0.04004509374499321]]}
