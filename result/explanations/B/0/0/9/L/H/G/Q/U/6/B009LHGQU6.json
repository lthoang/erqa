"], "reviews": ["This coffee was real good. Medium blend and not bitter after it sits for awhile.The zip lock packaging is great , more coffee company's should take note of this packaging.", "\"This coffee says that it is Arabica beans and I have always liked coffee made from these beans.  Maybe it is because I have been drinking Illy coffee for a while but I found this coffee lacking something.  It has a sort of wine-like after taste but not the type of wine that one would want to drink.  I even made this coffee in my French Pot which usually gives the coffee a stronger, more fragrant taste and even this did not help.  If I did not know better, I would think I was drinking a decaf. There is just no \"\"umph\"\" to it.  Illy is smooth but has a nice kick in the after taste which this coffee definitely lacked.  I was really disappointed.\"", "I was impressed when I saw the bag this Costa Rican Eco Coffee coffee came in, it  is a nice bright green and I really looked forward to my first brew. I  set my grinder at a medium grind and.....found my first pot was a complete disappointment! The usual waft of coffee all the way to my bedroom was almost non-existent and I found the taste was really below par! I have tasted instant coffee with better taste.The next morning, I set the grinder at medium fine and found  a slight improvement but really, this coffee is a real let down, same lack of aroma, same lack of taste. I also noticed I did not get much of a pick-up from these beans and wonder if this is an old batch...there is no expiration date to so it could well be!I really don't care about the packaging, though it looks really impressive, the coffee is very disappointing!", "There's a hint of fruitiness in this coffee.  It's quite mild and does not have any unpleasant or bitter aftertaste.  It's a lighter roast and is quite smooth.  I prefer a darker roast, but if you enjoy a light to medium roasted coffee, it's quite pleasant.I also like the fact that it is fair trade, which help to promote fair treatment of those who pick the coffee beans.It's a very good coffee and comes recommended.", "Full of flavor and aroma, a cup of this fair trade coffee is an excellent choice.  Reasonably priced, it is no more expensive than many of the choices found on the grocery store shelf and is more than competitive with niche roasters.  It is not always easy to live in a socially responsible way in this consumer oriented world so it seems important to take every opportunity to help provide a better future for everyone. Definitely recommended for its flavor and for its mission.", "I am not a coffee snob at all, and my regular go-to coffee is Jacobs Kronung ground coffee--sue me for buying it ground, but we like it just fine.  Anyway, I expected Eco Cafe to be a bit lighter in flavor but I actually had to finely grind it and use about 50% more to get the brew to taste good to me.  I really like the idea of fair trade coffee and will probably try it from Amazon already ground since the price isn't exorbitant, but I'm not ready to give up my Jacobs Kronung.", "By crispy I mean it had a bite, somewhere between bitter and smooth. Not too much of either one, but enough to enjoy it in a pleasant, frank manner. The fact of the story is that I have found out, through trials and errors, that coffee in bean form renders a more acceptable cup. Might not be by much, but it certainly shows it each time the decision to brew is made.Costa Rica is a lot of jungle, plenty of vegetation, and since I do not know the perfect weather in which each coffee finds an ideal medium, I can only attest to the brewing and drinking moments of the Eco Cafe Whole Bean, Tarrazu, 12 Ounce, which the tribe found very acceptable each time it was dispensed. Coffee drinkers all of them! Bags fly off the shelves!Usually I prefer a mix of several beans, that might work in concert to provide the ultimate, punchy, delectable cup of strong coffee (everyone here seems to be loosing steam at critical parts of the day, the coffee seems to elevate the desire to want to do something). From where I stand I give this coffee 4 good Stars, and from the bottom of our yearning hearts we thank amazon for the chance to try this Costa Rica original.In the world of international coffee, many contenders participate in their goal to be labeled the best, or the most expensive, which sometimes add up to the same thing. How about that coffee that monkeys poop down yonder in Indonesia way. What's up with that? Monkey poop at astronomical prices. A rarity, really, a true find. They eat the coffee berries, and later, skillful hands dig out the prized crop.  $20 an LB?Anypoop, I mean, anywhoo, the Eco Cafe Whole Bean, stood its own, and for how long it lasted, it was rather enjoyable. 4 Stars.", "If you like big, bold, dark, rich coffee, this coffee is not for you. It's called medium roast, but to me it tasted more like a light to medium roast, but you can adjust the taste by using more or less coffee. The whole beans are lovely and smell delicious. There are no instructions on the package about how much ground coffee to use per cup, so you have to guesstimate. The first time I made it too weak, but the next time I added more coffee and it was perfect. It has a super smooth, non-bitter taste that is great for a morning coffee. The packing is pretty and I like that it's a Fair Trade Coffee. If you like light/medium, smooth tasting coffees with zero bitterness, you will enjoy this.", "\"I normally like a dark/Italian roast (Peets) so was a little worried about this medium roast, thinking it might be too weak for me.  I found this coffee to have a great flavor - full-bodied, and it made a nice \"\"crema\"\" as it came out of our Miele coffee maker.  We served it at a dinner party and guests were very complimentary.I also like the zip lock packaging... why don't ALL coffee companies use these?  Great idea.So what else can I say... good coffee, try it, you'll probably like it!Hope this helps.\"", "\"Eco Cafe Tarrazu is a medium roast, medium body Costa Rican varietal coffee comprised of the arabica bean. When properly brewed, there is no bitter aftertaste. This is an enjoyable coffee with subtle earth tones. Nice to know it is also \"\"fair trade\"\" (you want a good salary, so do coffee plantation workers.)  The only real down side is the beans appear to be drier than most. This means extreme static when grinding the beans. You can end up with grinds everywhere. Otherwise, no complaints, just a good Costa Rican coffee.\"", "I LOVE Good coffee and this is exactly that.For several years I was a subscriber to the Gevalia Limited Edition Coffee Club and once a year I would receive 4 boxes of Tarrazu coffee and that's how I fell in love with this Costa Rica delight.While the Gevalia LTD club is no longer around, I now have a way with Eco Cafe to get this delightful coffee.This is a mild, but a very tasty & delicious coffee that I have back on my coffee list, now that I've found it again.Very SMOOTH, a True Delight.", "I really appreciate that the Eco Cafe Tarrazu coffee is fair trade and I understand that can bump the price up. However, I found the taste to be weak - a very light roast. It is described as a medium roast so I was surprised by how weak it was. I had to double up on the quantity of this in order to get a decent flavor. So not only is it a premium price for the 12 ounces of beans the package contains but I had to double what I would have of my normal coffee. It would be an expensive coffee to drink on a regular basis and for me the taste does not warrant it.", "\"The Eco Cafe Whole Bean Tarrazu coffee is an all-around excellent fair trade coffee.  It's actually my favorite type of beans, consisting of a medium roast and a darker roast.  This creates a well rounded and extremely smooth taste.  The beans have a slight oil sheen to them, and the aroma is exquisite!  I made a regular pot o' coffee and tasted both black and with half and half.  I love really good black coffee, but oddly enough I find many coffees a little too bitter by themselves, so I often add half and half to \"\"smooth\"\" it out.  This coffee is delicious black and with a little something added.  I don't sweeten my coffee, as that is much too blasphemous in my opinion &lt;g>, so someone else will have to provide feedback on how this tastes with their chosen sweetener. I plan on trying some espresso-type shots with this tomorrow.I'm not crazy about the packaging.  There's a notched tear strip across the top of the foil bag to open it, and the bag does reclose (like a zip loc), but the opening is very awkward and small.  The sides are pleated and the opening is actually on just one side of the bag's pleats, so the bag doesn't actually open up across the whole of the bag.  Other than that, I'm happy that the bag is truly resealable. And the bag is quite pretty.  :o)The price is very reasonable to me for the type of coffee that this is, so I would definitely buy this again in future.\"", "\"Eco-Cafe coffee is tasty.  While I wouldn't necessarily think of it as a gourmet coffee, it is definitely a good, high-quality coffee.  It is a whole bean, and in a medium roast.  As another reviewer mentioned, it's a touch on the oily side, for better or worse - I don't know if that's good or bad, but it did stick a little bit in my grinder.It's not a light \"\"breakfast blend\"\", nor is it an almost burnt French Roast - it is solidly in the medium part of the spectrum; a nice balance of flavor, roast, depth.  It really is a tasty, middle-of-the-road, all purpose coffee - and it is quite successful in that role.It's not among the \"\"best few I've ever had\"\", so not five stars; but it is a good quality product, and I would happily get this again, so it definitely earns four stars from me.\"", "Prep method: freshly ground at home to super fine, keurig reusable cup, largest cup settingI am a 2-cream, 2-sugar coffee drinker.  I took a few sips without anything just to see how it would go down.  I was really surprised!  This coffee brewed very dark, so I was REALLY surprised at how little bite there was! I put in 2 small scoops of powdered creamer, skipped the sugar, and enjoyed my cup!  It has a very strong flavor, but there's no bitterness to cover up with the sugar.  This is quickly becoming a favorite for my husband, as well, and he doesn't put anything in it!  Yummy!", "The packaging of the Eco Cafe coffee is very eye catching with its bright green bag.  When I opened the bag I was hopeful that the taste would be outstanding.  I set my grinder to the medium fine that I typically use for my ground coffee, brewed a pot and as my husband and I both sat at the kitchen table on Sunday morning sipping it we began to wrinkle our noses a little.  The first couple sips were not bad, but not great either.  Then it seemed to just starting tasting worse.This coffee just was not for us.  I would not buy, but everyone has different tastes and preferences when it comes to coffee.  (We typically buy the original Eight O'Clock beans - they are our favorite)", "These are good coffee beans. Excellent packaging, They are vacuum packed to promote freshness.Blended these with other , more robust beans (Columbia Supremo, darker Brazilan Santos) as Tarrazu Beans are lighter, mellower, have a great taste but do not stand alone so well in the stronger cup that most of us would like to have in the morning.Don't be intimated by blending take a few of those beans, a few of those, etc., put  them in your grinder and taste.Record your percentages so you can repeat the blend you like!Store beans well sealed in the freezer to promote freshness.", "Ever since I visited Costa Rica I've been a fan of their coffee. Costa Rican coffee is almost always a great daily drinker. Eco Cafe Tarrazu doesn't disappoint in that regard. It's the type of coffee that should please almost all coffee drinkers. It's medium roast and it truly is right in the middle on the coffee palate. It's not too dark and not too light. It thankfully doesn't have that taste that so many medium or light roast coffees have. In other words, it tastes nothing like the famous Dunkin Donuts coffee. I typically drink darker coffees but I love the Eco Cafe Tarrazu. It's the sort of coffee that I could drink all day.", "It is dark and rich like a well known coffee, but much more flavorful. This is what coffee should taste like. The fact that it is a fair trade product enhances purchasing this. This made one of the best cups of coffee that I ever had. I cannot recommend it highly enough.", "\"I've nearly emptied this bag of beans now, and am not really impressed. I drink one large cup of coffee a day (morning) and really like a bright strong cup. I know this is medium roast, but I have had many \"\"medium\"\" that deliver the goods in the morning. This is not one. I have to use a LOT of coffee to get any cup with some semblance of flavor that I yearn for. I found the beans to be hard too, tough to grind in comparison to others I typically use. I am anxious to move on to my next beans! There are some redeeming qualities for those that might appreciate the \"\"delicate\"\" flavor of this bean/roast: fair traded and eco-coffee. I know what fair-traded means and look for that in all coffees that I buy. But eco-coffee? Is this organically grown? Shade-grown? Unclear...\"", "I appreciate a wide variety of coffees, and coffee grown in the high altitude Tarrazu region is certainly one of them. This Fair Trade Costa Rican coffee is packaged in a beautiful green vacuum sealed pouch. The flavor is less acidic and more mild tasting than darker roast coffees like Columbian Supremo or French Roast, but still very delicious and fresh tasting. It is more similar to a Starbucks Blonde Roast, but more mild.  Be also mindful that this is whole bean coffee, so you'll need your own grinder (which is good if you like the superior taste of fresh ground coffee). Overall, Eco Cafe makes great mild coffee at a very competitive price.", "\"Pre-ground coffee is all well and good, and great for convenience, but when it comes to flavor and savoring the coffee experience, it's hard to beat whole bean. This fair trade coffee isn't a very dark roast and it doesn't have that super strong coffee aroma, so it may not be your go-to early morning wake up call, but it definitely ranks up there among the best for overall flavor.The description on the side of the bag calls it \"\"fruity,\"\" but I wouldn't actually go that far. Rather I'd call it \"\"balanced\"\" and \"\"smooth.\"\" It's not too light, not too dark, and hits the perfect balance between earthy flavor and that acidic tang. It works well either in the coffee maker or with a French press, although if you like your coffee dark you'll want to use a little more than normal in the press.As far as non-flavored whole bean coffee goes, this is a great one, and definitely worth trying for those always on the hunt for more delicious java any time of day.\"", "These coffee beans yield a lovely, complex cup of coffee. I think if your taste buds are used to espresso, you might find it a bit bland, but it's delicious for people who don't like that dark-roasted flavor, or for those who like something different once in a while. Very nice as a dessert coffee with a less-sugary dessert, or an afternoon break coffee with cookies (vs. espresso with a sweeter, heavier pastry). It also packs a punch as a breakfast brew. The taste may be mild, but the caffeine is there. In fact, medium roasted coffee beans retain more of the caffeine than dark roasts -- the roasting destroys some of the caffeine. Espressos make up for this by using twice as much coffee as brewed-style coffees. I recommend this especially for people who don't like that dark-roasted taste.", "I'm not a coffee puritan, enjoying mine heavily sweetened and creamed. I rough-ground two batches of beans in an electric grinder and made enough coffee in a French press for two eight-ounce cups. The result was smooth, mellow, and delicious.", "I got this coffee on the recommendation of my neighbors (who are from Spain). They make Greek style coffee and always use this brand. I love this coffee for it's strong, rich, nutty taste which remains smooth with mild after-taste. I have used it in both my drip style coffer maker and in my new K-Cup maker using a re-useable filter. It's whole bean with I like given I can do a fresh grind with each cup. If you like a bold coffee with the added bonus of a smooth finish (low acid) profile then you should give this a try.", "\"This whole bean coffee from Costa Rica makes a solid cup of coffee but it's not really anything distinct or special. The flavor is a little lighter than expected (seems lighter than a medium roast), necessitating raising the strength of the coffee on our coffee maker (or putting more grounds in if you grind it manually before you put it in). The eco and fair trade aspect of this coffee is nice to think about but there's not enough flavor to really make it a coffee to rave about. That being said, it's true that it offers a \"\"balanced acidity\"\" - there's no bad or bitter aftertaste.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.04112619534134865, 0.0382857471704483, 0.04431469738483429, 0.035604964941740036, 0.042259179055690765, 0.04334116727113724, 0.04262148588895798, 0.025690343230962753, 0.0415625236928463, 0.030030742287635803, 0.0344199612736702, 0.03728432208299637, 0.03449000418186188, 0.04365123435854912, 0.033006828278303146, 0.03552580624818802, 0.04256273806095123, 0.03189365938305855, 0.03701792284846306, 0.038804929703474045, 0.04035317152738571, 0.04556893929839134, 0.04070166498422623, 0.0413193516433239, 0.03840789571404457, 0.04015451669692993]]}
