"], "reviews": ["If you are looking at the Singolo espresso machine you might have already decided the convenience of the capsule outweighs the price. I have done several internet searches and the average price of a capsule works out to about 124 dollars per pound, according to MSN money. However, I do not ding a star for that because none of the capsule machines claim to be money savers unless they are being compared to coffee shops. So money aside let's talk machine.I have a Nespresso and I love it. I really liked my Delonghi espresso machine, but the ease and convenience of a capsule machine seduced me over to the capsule side.Both the Nespresso machines and the Singolo work with 19 bars of pressure. The nespresso offers several machines at various price points, from the esenza I own to the more expensive machines that have milk tanks. As of now the Singolo is the only machine I have found in the line and comes in white or black.The Singolo is programmed for large and small cups. Various Nespresso machines come programmed, mine is manual.Both machines work in basically the same manner, open lever, put in the capsule, close the lever, push the button. Some nespresso machines can take larger cups so the milk can be added first, mine is not adjustable. Taking the catch tray off the bottom of the Singolo allows a larger coffee cup to be used. Nespresso also makes adjustable tray machines.Nespresso used to be made in Switzerland but now appears to be made in China according to what I can find on with internet research.The Singolo states several times it is designed in Italy, however, according to the box it is made in china.The Nespresso has a wide variety of capsules, the Singolo has four, one is decaf.The Nespresso takes 1 minute 12 seconds to get ready (mine is the least expensive machines, I have seen reviews where higher end machines like the pixie take less time) The Singolo took 1 minute 10 seconds.The Singolo came out at around 170 degrees, the Nespresso at 165.The nespresso took 22 seconds to pull a cup of espresso. The Singolo took 1 minute for one pull, 38 seconds the next.The automatic turn off is not really something I care about as I can stand there for a whole 40 seconds to a minute.The Singolo is large, weighing in at 15 pounds. The top lever barely fits under our cabinet and there isn't enough clearance to get our hand up to pull it down.The Singolo is a counter eater:Front to back measures 15 inches. Width is 6 3/4 inches. From top to bottom with the lever up is 15 inches, closed is 12 inches.There are four capsules at this time:Decaf which is described as Dense and intense,Toscano - strong character that stands up beautifully in milk,Vigore- dense, intense, and very creamy,Verita-a mellow roast with fruit finish.I tried all four varieties. I drink my espresso black, Jim drinks his with sugar. I must say the espresso I was drawing simply wasn't good. Jim said they tasted like cheap beans and I thought everything had a plastic taste. We emptied the tank and put fresh water in to try again, at which point Jim discovered the valve on the bottom of the tank doesn't seal and it drips if there is water in it, but you can fill the tank without taking it off the machine. We tried again. Each time the various shots just didn't taste good. The espresso tasted either sour or bitter and over extracted. With more established machines you have a much larger choice of coffee.I don't know what the price point on amazon is going to be. The machine is for sell already on the net and you can see what they have it listed for.Because of the lack of variety in the cups, the counter space and cabinet clearance issues, the unknowns as in will there be more varieties eventually? And finally the taste of the espresso offered at this time, I cannot recommend the Singolo machine. There are better more established capsule machines already on the market with really good espresso.My machine came with the capsules out of the box, they were still in their foil sealed, but they were put around the machine while the boxes were flat and laying on top. I wasn't sure if I was sent a box each of all four capsules because I'm vine or if a regular buyer would get them like that. I called customer service and had to leave a message. A very nice woman called back within the hour, but she didn't know and said she'd have to check. 5 hours later and I still don't know. The product page doesn't mention getting sample capsules.*edited to add The rep called back and the machine does NOT ship with capsules, that was only so Vine members could review and evaluate the machine.", "Terrible packaging kills my review for this product. The product was so poorly packaged that the plastic water tank arrived busted. For this reason, I have been unable to use the product. I immediately contacted the company, and they were quite friendly and *seemed* willing to help me by sending me a new tank (hence my 2 stars instead of 1). However, that was at least a month ago and, as of yet, they have not kept that promise. From what I can gather by reading the product manual, this product does not have a steamer, and it brews by capsules that are similar to k-cups but not identical. Since the water tank is necessary for operation, until it comes, I am unable to actually rate the product on its operation and performance.", "This machine is a compact espresso machine that has a modernist look to it.  It's tall but narrow.  It's easy to use once it's been allowed to warm up.  The brewing process is similar to a Keurig coffee maker.  The espresso coffee is decent, although not as robust as other brands I have tried.I knew when ordering this that it did not come with a steam frother.  Understanding how capsule coffee is brewed, I can now understand why a wand is not included.  My biggest complaint about the machine is not the quality of coffee it brews, but the inability to buy more coffee capsules! I feel like this machine was introduced to American espresso drinkers without providing for enough sources for resupply.  So buyer beware.", "\"Simply put: not Singolo.When I first saw this machine, I was pretty excited to see that there would be some competition for pod-based espresso machines. Don't get me wrong, I love my Nespresso Espresso maker, but I ASSUMED that if someone were to go against the the crowd-pleasing Nespresso line, that they'd have found a few places to make it better.As I read about the Singolo, I was surprised not to see any features or benefits that would make it out-perform or out-simplify the Nespresso. In fact, the verbiage in the description seems to make it sound like it's the first machine to make espresso easily vs. traditional espresso machines. I don't know if they have Nespresso in Italy, but we do - and it's been simplifying tasty espresso for quite a while over here in America.Even through all this, I thought that perhaps the espresso would be so incredible that I would think, \"\"Oh! I see!\"\"Here's my take:The machine is too big - about the size of two shoeboxes stacked on top of each other. It's also white and plasticky. The handle is metal, but the trip and other \"\"metallic-looking\"\" parts are plastic. In fact, it looks just like the humidifier we use in my kids bedroom.The lid on the water reservoir just sits on the top. The reservoir has holes on the top sides as well. This means that you can't fill it up to the top. It also means that your water sitting there isn't sealed.To insert a pod you must open the bar at the top (similar to a Nespresso Citiz) and then open a little hatch. This looks and feels a little cheap to me.The drip catcher disassembles in an unusual manner. The top grate is metal, and just pops off - nothing to grab it with, other than the center hole. Then there's the plastic cup below, and then below that is a ledge to hold the two.The unit has a red light-up power switch (like an old-school coffee maker), a power button, and two espresso buttons to make a regular pull and a \"\"lungo\"\". The unit also has quite a bit of lights around it. The front bar lights up red, the buttons light up, and there is some kind of digital read out that shows through the plastic as well.Opening the pods, my first reaction was that the coffee smelled like the Foldgers crystals my Gramps used to drink.The instructions stated something about adding a water-softener packet to the water, so I searched for it but found nothing. Then I saw that it wasn't necessary as I read further. Weird.Making my first espresso, I was surprised at how much it glub-glubbed as it was made. I'm used to my Nespresso machine that just pours out evenly. This varied so much I had my daughter stand back because when I ran water through it the first few times to clean it, some splashed out. In fact, I later read in the instructions that the makers even suggest you stand back because of this splashing.One interesting feature that the unit has is that you can raise or lower the temperature of the espresso being made. This sounds great - I like mine hot, but I have always been under the impression that there is a correct temperature espresso (and good coffee for that matter) needs to be made at.---And finally, here's my opinion of the espresso itself:It was good. Not better than my Nespresso, not worse. Just about the same. If you're wondering, I drink my espresso black with nothing added.---So, after all that, here's my opinion:The Nespresso is significantly cheaper, smaller, nicer looking, has way more espresso flavor choices, the pods are more easily available in retail outlets and online, and the company that makes it is well-established and has excellent customer service.Sorry Singolo!\"", "\"The Singolo Espresso machine is a nice looking , slim streamlined (capsule) system for making single serve espresso.  It operates much like a KeurigKeurig B70 Platinum Brewing Systembut is slimmer, occupying less counter space.  The singolo uses as capsule systrem; similar to the ominipresent \"\"pods\"\" but a different shape and size (requiring you to buy refills from Singolo).  The machine ships with 60 capsules in 4 flavors:Vigore: \"\"Dense, intense, aromatic and very creamy. A classic blend of Central and South American coffee. As Italian as suits on scooters. \"\"  Manufacturer's description, which I personally find sa litt5le humorous... what could be more Italian than South American coffee?)Toscano: \"\"Strong character that stands up beautifully in milk. A rich, complex, medium roast blend from Peru, Mexico, and Sumatra. \"\"Verita: \"\"Fair-trade and organic. A mellow roast with a smooth fruit finish. Passport stamps from Peru, Brazil, Ethiopia, Sumatra, and Nicaragua.\"\"Decaf: \"\"Dense, intense, aromatic and very creamy. A classic blend of Central and South American coffee. As Italian as suits on scooters. \"\"The machine is very simple to use.  Fill the resevoir (about once a week) turn the machine on, lift the lever and drop in a capsule, press a button (don't forget a put a cup under the dispenser ;) and you've got espresso in a minute.  There's no clean up (on a daily basis).  The bin needs to be emptied after 10 uses.  All that said, it is simple and fast enough to make espresso on weekday mornings!Thus far I like the machine.  It occupies less counter space than a traditional espresso machine, has a good solid build, is attractive, easy to use and easy to clean.  However, the most important thing to me is taste.  I have tried 3 of the 4 coffees from singolo, all but the decaf.  I have to say that they looked very nice but, personally I did not find them as good as the espresso I get from my Krups machine (too old a machine to link as it is no longer in production).  It is, however, considerably better than the Keurig, in my opinion.  To provide some context for my opinion/ review... I am more than a bit of a coffee fiend, one could even say a fanatic ;)  I routinely drink Ethiopian Yergacheffe, Kenya AA or Java estate, fresh ground with a burr grinder and brewed in a KrupsKRUPS KM9008 Cup on Request Programmable 12-Cup Coffee Maker with removable build-in Stainless Steel Coffee Tank, Black(which makes very good drip coffee!)  In short, I am a pretty tough customer ;) with fairly well defined tastes.  (I like African coffee a lot!) and, for espresso, I use Intelligencia \"\"Black cat Intarsia\"\" when I can get it, or a dark roast Sumatra or occasionally, an Italian dark roast when I can't.  I am not, by & large, an off the shelf kind of gal ;) My feeling, this will not satisfy people who really like espresso , i.e. permanently replace your espresso machine, *However* for more casual coffee drinkers (most people) it is reasonably good, fast, easy and clean and does provide a simple way to make espresso if you have hectic weekday mornings.  The one caveat that I will add is that it is fairly loud (something I am quite sure my husband will not like at 5 Am).My assessment of the various flavors offered: I personally liked the Toscano the best of the lot.  It was creamy and dark, but a little bitter.  The next best, to my taste, and closest to traditional espresso was the Vigore, which I found similar in consistency, nice and creamy, but also a bit bitter.  I had expected the Verita to be a lighter coffee from the description.  It was also dark and creamy, but I found it a bit too bitter, tasted overexpressed.Why a description of coffees in a review of a coffee machine?  ll of these system coffees limit your range somewhat as you have to purchase units which fit the machine.  The manual for the Singolo specifies that Singolo capsules must be used (and I have not seen any other \"\"capsules\"\" of this shape on offer).  That said, you are not buying a coffee machine so much as a system.  It is very well and good to like the machine (and I do) but, if you do not like the coffee... Well, I think it is good as an alternative for harried week days.  It will not replace my espresso machine.  I do however find it much better than the Keurig.It looks like Amazon does not have the capsules in stock at the moment, so note that a better price may be available (as Amazonm generally provides the best pricing) but direct from the manufacturer, a box of 15 capsules (150 grams, or roughly 6 oz of coffee) costs $9.99, and a 4 pack (650 capsules, or about 24 oz of coffee) costs $36.99.  Compare that to the cost of single origin beansCoffee Masters Gourmet Coffee, Ethiopian Yirgacheffe, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)and you will see that the capsules cost 50% more, to double the cost of some of the best coffee around (and most costly).This issue carries over to any \"\"system\"\" coffee.  I personally like choice, LOVE African coffee, and am not too fond of paying twice as much... particularly for coffee I like , not as well.  There are trade-offs everywhere; such is the cost of convenience.I think it is nice to be able to have espresso as I am dashing out the door on a busy day, but when I have the time, on weekends, I will be using my old espresso machine with my (freshly ground) beans of choice.5 stars for the machine: Nice streamlined look, small countertop footprint, easy to use, easy to clean.2 stars for the cost of replacement capsules.1 star for the variety, available choices.Edited to note that I referred to pictures which I have not yet been able to post.  When that option becomes available, I will post them so that you can get a glimpse of the product (coffee).  It actually does make a nice looking cup of espresso.\"", "\"It's common for me to start the morning with a beverage made with coffee beans.  Years ago, we considered pod based espresso/coffee machines as well as automatic machines.  We finally decided against using pods and chose theSaeco Automatic Espresso Machine.  Even with a decent variety of roasts, we thought the pods were too limiting, and didn't like the associated waste.  Will the Singolo espresso machine with its biodegradable pods change my mind?The Singolo single serve espresso capsule system, made in China, was designed in Italy with an elegant and modern combination of high quality plastics, solid metals, and stylish aluminum trim.  An Italian made 18 bar pressure boiler to produce espresso quickly and quietly.  The minimalisticly designed espresso machine measures 6.75 inches wide, 14 inches deep, and 11.75 inches tall with the handle down or 15 inches tall with the handle in the upright position.  Alerts and measurements are provided by lights illuminating from behind the plastic outer shell.Making a cup of espresso is as simple as pulling the machine out to the edge of the counter unless you have an area without overhead cabinets, filling the reservoir with water, turning the machine on, waiting for the machine to warm up by watching the red light turn sky blue, pulling the capsule loading lever up, sliding the capsule insertion door open, inserting a capsule, closing the capsule door, pulling the capsule loading lever back down, and pressing either the small or large beverage buttons.The default amount of espresso produced by the small beverage button is about a 1 oz pour, and the large beverage or Americano button is a 2 oz pour.  The Singolo single serve espresso capsule system can be programmed, using a backlit display, to adjust the pour amounts by adjusting the number of CCs from a minimum of 20 cc to a maximum of 240 cc.  The results from the small beverage button is a steaming hot cup of espresso, with the large beverage button being mostly the same diluted with extra heated water.When the Singolo single serve espresso capsule system starts to brew, the capsule is punctured and the pump can be heard as heated water is being sent through the capsule and is thinly streamed through the coffee dispenser nozzle into your pre-warmed espresso cup where a nice even crema forms on the top.  I don't drink decaf, but the other three blends have distinct flavor profiles.  All three have a bitter twang in the flavor profile; I don't get this from the Saeco espresso machine.  Maybe sugar would help, however I don't use sugar in espresso or coffee.  Once ten capsules are dumped in the used capsule receptacle, a backlit display indicates the receptacle needs to be emptied.The BPA free 100% biodegradable capsules comes in recyclable packaging and the capsules themselves can be tossed into the recycling bin after use.  Measuring 25mm tall x 28mm at the base x 36mm at the top, the eco-friendly biodegradable capsules are about half the size of k-cups and currently only come in four varieties.  Verita, a fair trade and organic mellow roast with a smooth fruit finish, includes beans from Peru, Brazil, Ethiopia, Sumatra, and Nicaragua.  Toscano, a rich and complex medium roast blend from Peru, Mexico, and Sumatra with strong character to stand up beautifully with milk.  Vigor&eacute;, an Italian style blend of Central and South American coffee beans, is described as dense, intense, aromatic, and very creamy.  Plus what appears to be a decaf version of the Vigor&eacute; blend.I've used and enjoyed coffee from aKeurig coffee brewing system, and would not consider the Singolo single serve espresso capsule system a comparable device.  The concepts are similar, however the Keurig produces coffee, while the Singolo makes espresso.  Even the \"\"Americano\"\" option doesn't compare to the coffee produced by a Keurig system.  The only comparable machine I have experience with is our simple to use and maintain Saeco automatic espresso machine, a more expensive unit with much greater variety.The Singolo single serve espresso capsule system is an attractive, sleek, and modern appearing espresso machine.  The espresso produced is consistent, hot, and forms a good crema, however the resulting espresso has an unpleasant bitter twang.  I don't know if the bitter twang is from the coffee blends or a direct result of the espresso machine.  The limited variety of coffee blends combined with limited availability makes this espresso machine undesirable to me.  While Saeco espresso machines are more expensive, they also allow greater beverage and coffee blend variety.  After trying out the Singolo single serve espresso capsule system, I would still recommend Saeco over Singolo for the variety and espresso quality.PROS:Eco-friendly biodegradable capsulesItalian made 18 bar pressure boilerNo need for continuous recalibrationAdjustable temperatureOne touch operationEasy to cleanCONS:Slow and noisyAmericano short poured and just watered downCoffee capsules lack variety and availabilityHas to warm up again after period of non-use\"", "The single serve espresso machines are getting really popular because of its simplicity and convenience. I tried two machines before, Keurig and Nespresso. I liked the both for their simplicity and convenience. I liked Nespresso Pixie better than Keurig because of the design and integrity of the shot taste.Now I've tried this new machine from Canada (designed in Italy, made in China), and I still think Nespresso's Pixie is better. First, let's discuss the design. This Singolo machine is about same size as my traditional Capresso 10 cup brewer with milk frother. I wouldn't say this machine is terribly big, but it is noticeably bigger than Nespresso's pixie and about same size as bigger Keurig machines. Why can't this be small like Pixie? Because the water can is bigger. I remember when my friend had to serve coffees to the 20+ guests with his Nespresso machine; he had to refill the water can frequently. Singolo's water can holds 1.5L and it's enough to extract 20 shots straight without refilling. This is nice when I host dinner party for around 10+ adults. The design of this machine, compared to Pixie, is not cute, but rather bold. I had the impression that the Pixie was designed smart to save space and minimize a user's operating actions by making the product compact without losing its functionality. The Singolo machine also serves its functions, yet I think the drip catcher and capsule dispenser could have been incorporated to the main machine in a smarter way. For instance, with Pixie, I can fold the cup tray in for the bigger sized cup (for americano) without taking anything off or out. With the Singolo, I have to remove the whole drip catcher to use bigger sized cup. It is not a big deal at all and maybe it's even easier than the other method, but removing it from the machine is not always greatest way.Secondly, the usability is worth a mention. Out the box, I rinsed the water can and prepared the dripping tray for the first espresso. I filled the tank with spring water (instruction paper shows putting a water softener in the can, but I thought it would be OK without it as long as water's filtered or is spring water). Then, I ran the machine without a capsule for a couple of times to get rid of the `brand new machine smell/taste'. There's nothing complicated about the buttons or programmings, and it's just easy to use this machine, but I always recommend reading the manual before first use. I like the fact this machine has a main power button and secondary power button. It feels safer with two power buttons somehow. Then there are two buttons on the top, one for the espresso shot, and the other for americano. Before the machine is `ready' to pull, it took about a minute and a half for warming up from cold, and then, 45 seconds to pull one espresso shot. It took about two + minutes for americano though. After the brewing, it easily dispensed the used capsule into the tray that was part of the dripping tray that was inserted. By the way, I did not feel guilty about making so much plastic waste from the machine because the capsules are biodegradable plastic(Nespresso capsules are aluminum, also environment friendly material, fyi.). And again, compared to Pixie, this machine takes longer to pull and is somewhat louder.Next, the built quality is OK. Most of the outer parts are made of plastic, but the most important part of the machine, the boiler and the lever, are all-metal. Mine is white with silver and that goes well with my other while appliances in the kitchen, but this has too much of a 'plasticky' feel. There is also a black and silver one, and I think that will look a little better. Although the outer part is plastic, the machine is actually heavy. The plastic of the capsules seemed rather thick plastic as well, but they are biodegradable, which is important for me.Lastly, the taste of the coffee is certainly necessary to discuss. For each shot, I got around 60 ml. Sometimes much less, but most of the time, it pulls about same amount of espresso. I tried four different flavors, Vigore, Toscano, Verita, and decaf, which were all produced and packed in Italy. My favorite was Vigore. The other flavors are rather flat and felt as if flavor was missing, but the Vigore one was the one that was sort of integrated and creamy on top and somewhat bold after. All four flavors got good crema from the machine, yet, still I didn't get that sophisticated and wonderfulness of espresso that I get from the Nespresso machine. Of course not all coffees taste same, but I have to say Nespresso makes really great taste espresso shots compared to this one.One box of Singolo has 15 capsules and they cost about $10 per box, plus shipping. Due to the wide availability and popularity of the Nespresso machine, their capsules are cheaper and have variety of flavor choices currently.Overall, I have been using this espresso machine for about a month now, and I am feel it needs some improvements. Getting a shot of espresso is simple using this machine: it's easy, quick, and neat, but quick and easy are not the only two important components to make a nice shot. The shots are OK for me, and I wouldn't mind that for a while, but I might be having a hard time finding the right capsules. Also, the initial cost is rather high, in my opinion, and there are many comparable espresso machines out at competitive price range. So, yes, this is a decent machine, but do not expect the quality than that of Nespresso. My rating for now is 3.5 stars.", "The Singolo Espresso Machine is adequate for making espresso.  It doesn't have a frother and will only make 1 shot at a time.  It uses coffee pods that are only available from a single source, Costa Rica Coffee Export (CRCX).  The cost per capsule is about .78 each if you buy the 4 pack (60 capsules)for $36.99 plus $9.99 shipping.  They sell a package of 15 for 9.99 with 4.99 for shipping which makes the cost per capsule 1.00.  The cost per capsule/pod for other machines (Keurig, Nespresso, DeLonghi)range from .58 to .97 so the cost for 60 capsules is right in line with the others.It takes about 1 minute for the machine to heat up, and then about 1 minute for the large size to dispense and about 40 seconds for the small cup.Several reviewers have stated that the machine is too tall to put on the counter under their upper cabinets, but I have no problem with that.  It fits nicely on the counter, back against the wall.  It is about the same height and width as my Mr. Coffee coffeemaker. The water reservoir is a nice size, but as other reviewers have noted, the lid to the reservoir is not fastened in any way, but simply rests on top.  However, I have never had an issue with the lid coming off, even when I have picked the machine up and moved it to another place, so I don't consider that a big issue.As far as I can tell, there will not be a way to use your own coffee in a reusable container, like you can get with the Keurig or the DeLonghi ( I don't know about Nespresso) so you are stuck with their coffee varieties.  Some of the others that have reviewed this product haven't liked the flavor of the coffee, but I find it quite good.  The decaf is by far the best tasting decaf I have ever had.The machine is quite loud, but my daughter has the DeLonghi and they are both equally loud.  It's not scary loud, but you wouldn't want to make it while someone was sleeping because it definitely isn't quiet.The crema on the espresso is quite good, which is important to good tasting coffee.There are 2 settings for cup sizes, Large and Small.  They both come preset with the size (cc), but they can be programmed to put out more cc's or less, depending on your taste.  The capsules are quite small and so the coffee becomes weak if you use too much water.  The temperature can also be increased or decreased from the factory presets.It is important to know that this machine makes ONLY espresso.  At $299, it seems too expensive for just a single shot espresso machine.  The Nespresso Citiz w/Aeroccino frother is $295 and that seems to be a better buy for me because you can choose to have just espresso or can froth milk for lattes.Until the coffee becomes available from other sources, such as Amazon or locally, I would not advise purchasing this machine.  Having only 1 source for purchasing coffee makes me nervous (what if the supplier went out of business or stopped carrying the product?).Overall, it is a nice looking machine that makes decent espresso.  However, it is way too expensive for a machine that does only that and with the coffee being hard to get and limited in variety, I cannot recommend this machine.", "\"Update July 2013: What the heck? After all these months, this machine never went up for sale to the general public and capsules are impossible to find other than eBay and from a place in Canada, where I refuse to pay shipping.************************************I'm unimpressed with this machine. Compared to my CBTL Kaldi that I have owned almost 2 years and costs much less, I would only consider this Singolo to be a value if the price-point was under $150. (Amazon's price is unknown at this review date, but it's $299 on Singolo's site). And the CBTL machines also make tea and regular coffee, too, not espresso only.The Singolo is built too tall for American-style cabinets; to be able to pull the handle back it needs to be moved out near the counter's edge (although the styling does look nice/sleek). Maybe Italian kitchens are different (this is designed by Italians, but manufactured in China).As far as the espresso: Good crema; the espresso flavors are \"\"ok\"\" --there are only 4 flavors for now. I like the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf (CBTL) better (more choice, better flavor) and those capsules are easy to purchase here at Amazon, Target, or Bed Bath and Beyond.If you are concerned with used capsules taking up space in landfills, the Singolo may be a better choice, as these capsules are 100% biodegradable, the CBTL capsules are not.\""], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.1093398928642273, 0.12073089927434921, 0.13730022311210632, 0.10877075046300888, 0.11131297051906586, 0.11257985979318619, 0.057465098798274994, 0.11158298701047897, 0.13091731071472168]]}
