It is really easy to pair (connect) using Bluetooth with either iPad or iPhone and once you connect, it reconnects as soon as you turn the speaker back on. The rubberized exterior makes it durable and compact size (Size: 6.2\"\" wide, 2.5\"\" tall, 1.6\"\" deep) makes it easy to throw in your bag and take with you. I found the sound quality to be good considering it's compact size, but a bit on the flat side. I also have a Sound Blaster speakerCreative Sound BlasterAxx SBX8 Audio Speaker with Microphone(although non-bluetooth), and when comparing the two the Sound Blaster wins hands down.There's 3 buttons on top: a negative sign (-) to turn volumn down, a postive sign (+) to turn volumn up, and a dot (.) to pair. Pairing is easy, just hold the button down till the side light starts blinking and then go into your iPad or iPhone settings and click on the Blue-Tooth setting. You will see SP1 come up on the list, then click to connect. You can move the speaker up to 30 feet away before it disconnects. Another reviewer said 'Bluetooth connectivity needs direct line of sight so audio is not disrupted', but I did not find that so; I was able to move around into various rooms of my house without it disconnecting.The power switch is on the side and doubles as a status light. It flashes depending on the status:Flashing Red means low batteryAlternating Red and White means it's chargingSolid white means it's on and fully chargedFlashing white means it's in pairing mode and trying to connect, goes solid white once connected.Below the power switch is the headphone jack (which I never use) and the power plug in. You get a 3.5 stereo headphone connection cable (if you don't want to use bluetooth). You also get a USB power cable, but you have to supply your own wall USB plug or use a computer USB port to charge it. Both cables are kind-of cheesy, thin cables, so I'm concerned that they won't withstand long-term use. The speaker uses an internal lithium-ion batter to recharge. The battery is not replaceable, so this unit has a limited life once the battery goes bad! It took about 3 hours to charge..but no way to know how much charge is left. The manufacturer says it has 10 hour playback time, but I found that it lost power soon than that.I marked down by 1 star for these three reasons.Flat sound compared to my Sound Blaster Speaker.Thin USB and speaker jack cables.Non-replaceable battery.Other than that, I love the unit. It works well and love the design! For the price, this is an awesome, easy-to-use, decent quality speaker!\"", "\"First, this is a very small mono speaker and I think it needs to be judged like that. It's not going to replace larger stereo speakers, but to me it sounds far better than most stereo laptop speakers and is lightweight enough that you won't mind carrying it around.Though it's designed for smarphones I think, I have used it with my laptop when I'm doing a presentation for a small group. It works well for that. It works fine for music and the lack of stereo in a device this small isn't (to me) an issue.At the time I'm writing this, the price hovers around $70 and that seems to be a very good price given that similar speakers are usually close to $200. Are they better? I've only head others a couple of times, but they don't sound better to me.Other reviewers have commented on the lack of a 'wall wart' charging system for this, so that you have to plug it into your computer. That's true if you don't already have a USB charger. For me that wasn't an issue as I've collected several usb wall chargers over the last few years and I find that they usually work faster (the good ones) than the USB port on my computers, so I'm find with it.I'm a vine reviewer, and the white one was provided for me for review and I didn't have a choice of colors. I don't mind the white, though I wish the front didn't have the pink color. Were I to buy this I'd get one of the other colors, but that's not a criticism. I just wanted to mention that if you're wondering if in \"\"real life\"\" the pink is as pink as in the photos, the answer is yes.\"", "pros: sounds good,(it is mono)was cheaper than most options when i bought itlooks coolCons: batter is getting flaky (this almost one year of use and certainly not heavy use) so i't not so happy about thatThere are others now in this price range but i haven't looked at any personally because even though the batter is not as good at holding a charge it still work when it's plugged in and i'm generally near power so its not a total loss yet", "\"The a.m.p (antec mobile products) SP1 Portable Bluetooth Speaker is one of those electronic devices that I can't live without.  First, it was easy to pair with my Apple iPhone 4.  I simply followed the instructions in the SP1 Speaker's user manual.  I pressed and held the center button on the top of the speaker for six to eight seconds and \"\"SP1\"\" automatically appeared in the iPhone's list of devices under Settings/Bluetooth.  Now, whenever I switch the speaker to the \"\"on\"\" position, my iPhone immediately recognizes it.  I can listen to my music and movies while I am cleaning my apartment, eating, exercising, etc.The SP1 Speaker is extremely portable.  It arrived in a transparent, plastic container and I keep it in this for added protection whenever I take it to the clubhouse at my apartment complex, my church, or to the shipyard where I work.  The speaker fits easily inside my JanSport backpack (JanSport Spring Break Classics Series Daypack).  The speaker is too big to carry inside the pocket of my pants or jacket.  (Sometimes I hold it tightly in my hand when I am walking short distances.)  I can't wait until the weather is warm and I can take it to the clubhouse's swimming pool.The sound is wonderful.  It is clear indoors and outdoors and has a range of thirty feet.  I have listened to the SP1 Speaker while I was reading and relaxing inside the gazebo behind my apartment building.  It never stuttered or faltered like some wireless headphones do when you wear them outdoors while exercising.  You can turn the volume up or down by pressing the \"\"+\"\" or \"\"-\"\" buttons.  For optimum sound, the speaker should be fully charged and the iPhone placed close to it.  If someone calls while I am listening to my music, the music will stop playing; I simply press the center button and lean in close to the speaker in order to clearly understand what my caller is saying to me.  Pressing the center button again will end the call and the music will resume.The LED indicator on the power switch, when turned to the \"\"On\"\" position, will indicate by its color the status of the speaker's battery and operation: (1) Flashing Red: Low Battery; (2) Alternating Red and White: Charging; (3) Solid White: Fully Charged; and (4) Flashing White: Pairing Mode.  All this is explained in the user manual.  If the manual becomes lost, don't worry. You can download a copy from the Antec Store website.  Google or Yahoo \"\"Antec Store\"\" and do a search for \"\"SP1.\"\"  There is also a fun video on the website that depicts its various usages indoors.I have been using my a.m.p SP1 Portable Bluetooth Speaker nearly every day for almost four months. I have a habit of charging it every second or third day.  It hasn't given me any problems.  The color of my SP1 Speaker is white but it comes in two other colors: forest green and magma black.  (I like the black best.)  Because of its ease of use and portability and the high quality of its sound, I strongly recommend the SP1 Speaker for those who travel extensively, enjoy relaxing outdoors, or simply want a portable speaker for listening to music while having a romantic dinner.  It is also great to have around for an impromptu party.Note:  I received conflicting instructions about the initial charging of the SP1 Speaker.  The user manual states that the speaker ships pre-charged; initial charging is recommended but not necessary.  A separate slip of paper, with the diagram of a battery, require the user to fully charge the speaker prior to initial usage.  To be on the safe side, I fully charged the speaker before I paired it with my Apple iPhone 4.  In fact, I have made it a habit of charging ALL my electronic devices before using them for the first time.Joseph B. Hoyos\"", "\"I was quite favorably impressed when I tested these speakers. I was not sure what to expect, since so many of this type of item are badly done.That is certainly not the case here. The speaker is heavy and solid, and its case has enough \"\"stickiness\"\" to it that it stays put even on smooth surfaces.The biggest surprise for me was how good it sounds. Let's face it, it is really difficult for a speaker this small to sound very good, but these folks have managed to do a good job of that. Obviously, the bass response is not very strong (you have to have a certain size and mass for that), but it is much better than I expected.Mids and treble are handled very well, and the speaker is clear and tight in its reproduction of sound.Operation is easy and straightforward. I had no trouble in using either the Bluetooth or cabled connection with my devices. Audio quality was pretty good either way, which also pleasantly surprised me. It was fun to walk from one end of my small apartment to the other and not lose signal to the speaker.One failing is the microphone. I tired using it as a speakerphone for my mobile, and while I could hear quite well, others could not hear me well at all. Don't get this for a Bluetooth speakerphone, you will be disappointed in the mic quality and volume.It came with enough charge to let me experiment a bit, and recharging did not take too long at all.If you have a use for a Bluetooth speaker that is rechargeable, then definitely consider this. I don't think you will be disappointed in it as a speaker.\"", "I've experimented with several alternative parts, some cheap, some not-so-cheap. I picked up the Monster offering for a song ($39!!) some months ago, but my wife took it, so I was off on another search. I'd previously liked the Jawbone Jambox quite a bit, but honestly, in a/b, I think this one sounds  much better, and is half the price. Battery lasts a long time, and it's plenty loud. It's very solid, and feels durable.When you put it on a flat surface, the bass can get a little boomy, and the midrange a little overdriven. Try putting it on something (like, say, sitting on top of a Coke can) or standing it on end (it's not stereo, but with only a couple inches of separation, that's not meaningful). It sounds MUCH better on the table standing vertically, the side with the switch up.If you're looking for a small bluetooth speaker to carry from room to room with you, this is a great choice. Go for it.", "\"UPDATE: 21 Nov 2012The company responded to my inquiry about the speaker and told me that the speaker is a monaural and not stereo speaker.  While I presumed that, I was not sure and wanted to be able to post the correct information here.  Inspite of that, the speaker provides amazing sound.  One other piece of information, while there is not a serial number on the unit, there is apparently a serial number on the packaging that the speaker comes in.  So, DO NOT DISCARD your packaging before copying down the serial number of the unit!!REVIEW:I asked for this item because I thought it would be nice to see how far wireless speakers have come with Bluetooth capability.  I was not really expecting much from the speakers, just hoped for high enough quality to be able to listen to podcasts while in the garage.The speaker arrived and it both impressed and frustrated me with the packaging and the weight.  The packing is heavy weight plastic and is a bit of a pain to open.  The speaker is solid and felt like a brick in weight.  Actually, it is only 13 ounces, but it sure feels heavy to compared to most electronics that size.  The instructions tell you to charge it first and they do not include a charger.  They do, however, include a short cable with a plug for the unit and a USB termination.  Since I have a 3.1A USB charger, I connected it to that and waited the two hours for the red light to go out on the speaker (the light is red when it is charging).  As a point of interest, that same light is used to show when the unit is connected (glows a solid white) when it is not connected (does a slow blink) and when it is in search mode (rapid blink).Once the unit had charged (two hours) and the light had gone out, I turned the unit on.  I guess they wanted you to know it was working since they have a short music piece they play when it powers up and also when it powers down.  While a bit of an annoyance, it is not too bad  It would be nice if you could turn it off though.Ok, now on to the important part, how does it work?  I first tried it out using a Kindle Fire HD.  I turned on Bluetooth in the Kindle and then turned on the speaker and held down the center button (puts the unit into search mode--NOTE: ensure you hold it down for a few seconds to get it into search mode, you will know it is there if the light goes to a rapid blink).  The Kindle found the speaker and added it without issue.Once paired, I played several different types of music with everything from string instruments, to singing, to orchestra, to country, to swing, to ragtime and it all sounded great!  I was VERY impressed with the volume and lack of distortion.  It easily filled two rooms with sound that was quite loud and with no distortion.  The frequency range appears to be from about 75 hz to around 20,000 hz based upon the sound reproduction with the pieces that I played.  While the base is not phenominal, it is very good.I was able to seperate the speaker from the Kindle by more that 30 feet.  It connected and stayed connected even when I went upstairs and placed two walls between it and the Kindle.  At the third wall it started dropping out.  I was able to take the speaker outside onto my back deck with the Kindle left in the front room and it still continued to play without problems.I do not know if this unit is actually stereo and I am not sure it would make any difference since there is little seperation distance, but it does sound very good and I am very pleased with it.I also connected this unit to my IPAD and to my ITOUCH as well as to three different computers and it continued to work well.  NOTE:  I did not try to connect to all of them at the same time!  I turned off the bluetooth connection on each one before trying to make a connection on another device.If you are looking for an exceptional speaker that produces very good sound from a Bluetooth connection, I would highly recommend that you consider this speaker.One quick comment about support for this unit, going to the company's website to ask for assistance (I wanted to know if this was actually stereo or not) you needed to enter in the product name and serial number.  The product name is NOT on the website and there is NO serial number on my unit.  So, not sure how well this unit will be supported and how you can obtain service as those are required fields and you cannot go anywhere without that information.  I just put in \"\"N/A\"\" for both fields and have not, as of yet, received a response.  I will update this when I hear back from them.\"", "This speaker is loud and clear and lasts for 8-9 hours for each charge, which is plenty and for less than $100 this is really a great buy. The speaker can also be used with a mobile phone and it is easy to carry. The only reason I gave it a four stars is because I don't quite like the white/pink color.", "a.m.p. took a page from Apple in their aesthetics, design, and packaging. The portable speaker comes beautifully packaged in a white cardboard and clear plastic and would present nicely as a gift. It does have that plastic-y, slightly chemical smell when first taken out of the box, but it quickly dissipates after opening unless you hold the speaker right up to your nose (which I totally did).The speaker can connect to devices either via Bluetooth or the included cable to connect via a headphone jack. The included USB cable feels thin and flimsy, but then again, that might be an asset since the entire idea of this item is its portability. It's definitely small enough and feels sturdy enough to toss in my bag and go. The non-speaker faces of the speaker are coated in silicone which should provide some level of protection.It charges via a USB cable (included) but does not have a wall charger so I'm still waiting for this to fully charge up. I was able to turn it on and it makes a weird video game noise when turning on and turning off. The documentation that comes with the speaker is sparse and doesn't mention any ability to change the noise it makes when turning off and on. (Think about a Samsung TV and the noise it makes when turning off and on and make it louder and more annoying.)Overall I think the device is nice but I've taken off one star for the funny smell and one star for the lack of a wall charger. Once it's done charging I'll put it through its paces and update my review, however so far I'm pleased with the device compared to other speakers, portable and other-wise that I've owned. I'm definitely impressed with how sturdy it feels. Hefty enough to not get damaged, but light enough to still remain easily portable."], "Gamma": [0.2494911253452301, 0.24948923289775848, 0.24948923289775848, 0.25153040885925293], "Beta": [[0.003168136579915881, 0.5825742483139038, 0.0025383031461387873, 0.0023030543234199286, 0.005579950287938118, 0.31208574771881104, 0.0005023293197154999, 0.08898080885410309, 0.0022674223873764277], [0.0031681295949965715, 0.5825743675231934, 0.0025382989551872015, 0.0023030503652989864, 0.005579943303018808, 0.31208571791648865, 0.0005023282719776034, 0.08898074924945831, 0.002267420757561922], [0.0031681295949965715, 0.5825743675231934, 0.0025382989551872015, 0.0023030503652989864, 0.005579943303018808, 0.31208571791648865, 0.0005023282719776034, 0.08898074924945831, 0.002267420757561922], [0.0031866049394011497, 0.5817327499389648, 0.0025567305274307728, 0.0023426073603332043, 0.005609535146504641, 0.31263428926467896, 0.0005138703272677958, 0.08911483734846115, 0.0023087002336978912]]}
