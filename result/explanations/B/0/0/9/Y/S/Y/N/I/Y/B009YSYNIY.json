"], "reviews": ["My wife uses this iron and says that she likes it.  It works well and the design is attractive.  Orange is her favorite color, so it was a hit.", "I have thick long frizzcurly hair so regularly use a hot iron to style my hair.  I wanted a change from the stick straight look and thought I'd try a curling iron. The Andis Tangerine Twist 1 inch is an acceptable styling tool for the money. The best feature is the speed with which it heats up - plug it in and in seconds you are ready to go.  And the temperature adjusts so you can control the softness of the curl.  However, the on off button is in an awkward position so I found myself hitting the off button while I was twisting my hair in place.  There's also a blinking light feature, which presumably tells you that your curl is ready, but more often than not it was faced in a direction I couldn't see so rendered useless.  However, for the price, you can pretend it never came with these features, make do and have a perfectly serviceable curling iron.", "This curling iron is notable for its versatility, particularly in the wide range of heat settings. I am far from being adept with such products, yet enjoyed using this, and was successful in arranging my (very curly) hair in new styles. Highly recommended.", "My girlfriend has been using this to style her hair.From her perspective it doesn't dry out hair excessively. The curls are smooth and not frizzy. She would have preferred the larger barrel, but this is good for smaller, tighter curls.She has no complaints for the device or the effects of using it. She thinks the price is great and affordable.She would recommend this to a friend.", "I received this curling iron by mistake, but I'm thrilled with it!What it does:It gives my very long hair a smooth finish.  None of the obvious curling iron twists and turns.It heats up FAST!  By the time I've gotten the tangles out, it's ready to go.  I like the wide spectrum of heat settings, though I've never dared go beyond the mid to low range for my fine, color treated locks,  This would be the bomb for coarse, curly hair.Did I mention how smooth it makes my hair?What it doesn't do:The control is exactly where my index finger goes when using the iron.  This means it gets turned off frequently.  Not a huge issue; it's very easy to turn back on.As with any heated curling device, it's easy to damage hair when seeking an extreme effect.  If you, like I, try for natural looking, great hair, this is your gadget.", "This is my 3rd curling iron and by far it's the best, especially since it was 20.00 less than the last iron I purchased.What I love about it...* Heats up VERY quickly.  You basically plug it in and its ready in less than 30 seconds.* 20 heat settings.  This is important as the first time I had it on too high and when turning it down, it immediately dials down to that temp.* Comes with a stand which neither of my irons did.* Auto shut off.  It is pretty much standard now, but one of my irons does not have this feature.* Lastly, it seems to make my hair shinier, perhaps it is the titanium.The only negative I had was that I turned it off accidentally a few times.For the price this is an excellent curling iron, and the color is cool too.  Highly recommend.", "Like another reviewer said, I had the worse time trying to curl my hair with this curling iron. I kept hitting the off button by accident. That was really annoying. But, once I got going, it was a little easier to avoid. It curled my hair really well and it does get some major heat!Overall, I liked it, I just wish the design was a little better."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.12875181436538696, 0.13160687685012817, 0.15158432722091675, 0.14635568857192993, 0.13259592652320862, 0.16227059066295624, 0.14683479070663452]]}
