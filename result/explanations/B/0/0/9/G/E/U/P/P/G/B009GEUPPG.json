Satin Finish Lotion on my forehead and eyebrows. Anywhere else and it will give me pimples. If you have oily skin, this is NOT the product for you!", "This is a really nice, light-weight facial moisturizer. It has a soft, silky feeling to it. The fragrance is subtle and pleasant.My skin felt oft after using it. It is oil-free and non-comedogenic and, so far, I have not had any breakouts with it.", "This lotion is a little pricey when you consider that it's only 1.7 fl oz. However you only need to use a very small amount of it. I usually only use a tiny little squirt about a third the size of a pea. So at this rate this lotion will last me at least a few months even with daily use. I am usually not a big lotion person because I can't stand the way it makes your hands feel but this lotion doesn't give the same feel. It immediately smooth's your hands and makes them feel very silky without feeling like you have lotion on your hands. I also like that it really doesn't have a scent so both women or men will like it. Plus sometimes my hands will crack during the winter months and scented lotions will burn but this doesn't burn either. I have used a lot of different lotions but this is my new favorite without a doubt. I would highly recommend this one!", "\"My skin can get dry very easily in the winter time so I need to use lotion every day to prevent excessive dryness. This Olay lotion does the trick.It's advertised as having a \"\"satin finish\"\" and it certainly does! It goes on so easily and makes my skin feel instantly smooth and soft. It's not greasy in the slightest. The feeling lasts for a long time as well. My only problem with the lotion is that the smell is noticeable and may bother those are sensitive to smells. But other than that, this lotion is perfect!\"", "Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! Satin Finish Lotion is a different kind of moisturizer than I'm used to seeing from Olay. It applies easily and dries to what I would call a matte not satin finish. It's not greasy at all and feels like a powdery finish when it dries on my face.I have to say that I don't like this moisturizer, not for my skin type. I have dry skin and am over 40 so I need a different type of moisture than this provides. I need a more moisturizing moisturizer. My skin looks even drier after applying it.It reminds me of an oil-control lotion. Gives that exact same effect, feel and look on my skin as does the ones that are made to control oil from the acne control brands.I think if you need an oil control moisturizer then this would be a good choice.", "This is a wonderful moisturizer but not quite enough for my very dry winter face! I might like it better in the summer when there is more humidity and I don't need the intense hydration that I need at this time of year. I do love how smoothly the satin finish lotion glides on and the feel of it on my skin, but I had to keep reapplying it after washing my face in order to get rid of the tightness. It has a light, pleasant fragrance. It is supposed to be oil-free and non-comedogenic so it shouldn't clog pores or cause any breakouts.I think anyone who wants just a light moisturizer will find this very appealing.", "\"One note I would like to make on this moisturizer is I don't feel \"\"light\"\" connotates the correct nature, for this is a product that succeeds in its aim to moisturize.  I wouldn't consider this a fault, but a person looking for only the barest bit of moisture for their skin might want to look elsewhere.The rest of us looking for a good moisturizer, however, will rejoice in this one.I haven't used an Olay moisturizer since my college days and for the life of me I don't know why I quit. I don't recall just which one it was, but it was wonderful and Olay has always been a brand I trusted.  I consider this to be another product that simply lives up to the Olay standard.The lotion/gel combo description is certainly an apt one, for I can't think of another way to describe the consistency.  It's not so watery as to make you wonder \"\"what the devil is in this stuff?\"\" nor is it so thick and creamy you fear an afternoon break-out or at least that heavy sensation of some moist layer upon the skin.I found that a little went a long way, and believe this is the kind of product where the individual can decide on an amount depending on the skin needs (though I would recommend this for normal skin).  It absorbed fairly quickly and did not leave a greasy look-who-just-moisturized impression.  Within about ten minutes I could put on a powder foundation just fine.  The moisture?  Great.  My skin feels clean and soft and sufficiently hydrated.  It suggests to put it on as needed, but for me the once-a-day application is perfect.  As for the whole fresh effects thing, yes, this has a fresh and clean aroma that also applies to the sensation.In conclusion, a great little moisturizer for those really needing it. Skin feels great and looks great without the greasy blob sensation.\"", "Really loved this product. I put it on my hands, neck, and face and found that it blended in nicely and didn't leave a greasy residue behind. I put it over sunscreen and under makeup, and it seemed to work out really well that way.", "Olay Long Live Moisture comes in a pressurized pump that dispenses the lotion easily and accurately.  This is good, because you don't need much to cover your skin.  The lotion has a light, silky feel that is very pleasant.  I don't know if it has brightened my skin, as some people have mentioned, but has definitely made it feel nicer and smoother.  I am a person who is quite sensitive to fragrance, to the point that I avoid certain aisles in stores where strong smelling items are shelved.  While this lotion does have a fragrance that I don't exactly find pleasant, it isn't unpleasant and it isn't strong enough to bother me.  I also have break-out prone skin and I did not experience any break-outs while using this product.  The only possible downside is the lack of SPF.  However, I have other products for that, and there are times I might use this, in the evening for example, where it wouldn't matter anyway.  I received this through the Vine Program, but I will seriously consider buying it in the future.", "After 2 weeks of using Olay Fresh Effects Long Live Moisture! I have noticed it doing a substantially better job than many other moisturizers.  Many moisturizers feel great for a little while but end up drying out your skin more than helping it in the long run.  This lotion seemed to leave my skin visibly healthier long after it was applied.  It doesn't feel the best going on, slightly slick and oily, but I don't mind.", "\"I liked this product from the moment I saw the box. I was a little disappointed that I didn't see an spf listed, although a scan of the ingredients did show titanium dioxide (but pretty far down the list) which I know is a sunscreen. I liked that it didn't promise a thousand incredible things that it couldn't possibly deliver on. It just said it gives you a satin finish, with the hydration of a lotion but the lightweight feel of a gel. One pump on the top of the bottle produced just the right amount to cover my face. It had a nice opalescent sheen to it on my fingers and felt good on my skin. In the past I've liked Olay products except for the smell, but this product has a rather pleasant smell.Then I started reading the ingredients. I wasn't familiar with most of them, but my boyfriend is a chemist so I thought maybe he could help me. He looked at me like I was crazy when I pulled out the box in the middle of a busy, crowded restaurant.\"\"Why are you showing this to me?\"\"\"\"Because you have a degree in chemistry. You're a polymer chemist and some of these ingredients say polymer.\"\"\"\"This is all chemicals!\"\"I was a bit frustrated by him saying this. Yes, I KNOW it's all chemicals. If you go to the facial moisturizing section of the drug store, it IS mostly all chemicals on all the boxes, and some of them have a much longer ingredient list than this!\"\"Well, this is antifreeze. Google it. You're putting antifreeze on your face.\"\"\"\"So, don't let my cats lick my face? I mean, what does that mean? Is that bad?\"\"\"\"It's all chemicals!\"\"\"\"Yeah I know but...some of them are silicones...don't a lot of those evaporate?\"\"\"\"Yes, but not antifreeze...\"\"(What followed here was a long science-y diatribe on how antifreeze works.)\"\"Okay...\"\" (eyes glazing over)\"\"See this one? You know California's Prop 65? That was created because of this ingredient. It's a known carcinogen.\"\"\"\"Okay...that sounds bad...but don't you have a warning sign outside your business about carcinogens on the premises?\"\"\"\"Yes, but you have more of it right here in this bottle than I do in my whole business. Google it. Google these ingredients!\"\"Yikes!So, now I have spent some time googling the ingredients and also researching Olay. It IS a lot of chemicals, but on the other hand it's that whole genre of products, not just Olay. I'm reevaluating whether I should be seeking out something more natural and simple, not whether I should use Olay specifically. Ultimately, my primary disappointment with this moisturizer is the lack of SPF. I burn easily and need some protection.\"", "This moisturizer has a really nice gel-like feel and spreads nicely, leaving my face feeling supple and smooth. It has a slight matte-satin effect which minimizes fine lines and skin roughness. Really lovely and I like it much better than a tinted foundation for improving the appearance of my skin. It has a very light scent... I don't care for scented products on my face but this isn't too bad, though I think I'll look for an unscented version next time.", "\"Age: 55skin type: slightly sensitive with occasional redness from RosaceaFirst off, the pump bottle is great! I just tried another product (not Olay) that was $60 for this tiny tube and the pump bottle, in a word: sucked like the suckest sucker in suckland. Now here's this Olay product that kicks the ass of the expensive one and doesn't spit expensive product all over my walls, blouse, hair, mirror. yeah.It doesn't take much of this moisturizer to be effective - which is nice, since I am sick of spending lots-o-cash on expensive facial cleansers and moisturizers. Sometimes expensive is better, and sometimes expensive is just that: more money, not any better results.This is what I love about Olay products - they try to find effective products without digging their paws into our wallets until we beg for mercy.When I pump a bit of this product (and you don't need a lot!), it has a luminescent look to it, and that I like. Maybe I'm fooling myself, but I feel that luminescence will be on my face as well, and it does seem to transfer in that way. I spread a bit on my clean dry face and it feels wonderful - so good on my skin, very silky smooth-ahhhhh. I don't care what it has it in, honestly. Just because it feels so good, that's enough for me. It's not expensive, so why not? Leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean - and there's a slight fragrance that I enjoy -- it's not heavy, but just adds to my \"\"mmmmmm\"\" experience. And, as well, there is no irritation for my slightly sensitive skin and Rocasea - no redness, no stinging. It's not greasy, so there's no clogged pores to create blemishes, either.This is one I'll buy.\"", "I'm a fan of this product.  It's much like the serums in consistency and makes my skin feel smooth and moisturized without feeling greasy or clogged. I put this on every morning prior to putting on my other makeup.  I let it soak in a bit while I dry my hair and then put on my makeup..but there is no dry time required at all.  You can and I have put my makeup on right over top. In fact I think when I do that, it helps my makeup glide on and smooth over my skin nicely.  But it doesn't matter if you wait or don't wait.  There is no smell and the texture is smooth and creamy like serums and it is also clear like the serums.Love it!  I also love this closed top cap lid design better than the other serum bottles that come with an easily lost cap.", "I have been a user of Olay products for years and years. My favorite was the original moisturizer that came first in glass bottles and then in plastic jars. Now a wonderfully new improved moisturizer in a slim pump that can be easily put in your purse and used for those times when you need a little bit more moisturizer on the go. I really like the satin finish. I used to use olay as a base and then a satin finish cream on top before applying make up, NOW I can skip the satin finish expensive product and use this one for an all in one application. It makes my skin feel smooth and the satin finish keeps the make up from caking during the day.The pump is a super idea because you can regulate how much you use at a time compared to the jars and also the whole product is not exposed to getting any particles in it from your dressing table. Sometimes with the jar moisturizer you can get flicks of make up or other residue. With this you are assured that the product is clean coming out every time with just the right amount With Olay products a little goes a long way. With the jar I sometimes would get too much on my fingers and would apply the extra to my hands. With this new design there is no extra product to wipe off. I love the way it makes my face feel as I have super dry sensitive skin and Olay has never let me down. I will definitely buy this product from now on.", "PROS: I liked the smell. For regular users of Olay, this fragrance will be familiar. It's very moisturizing and my skin felt wonderfully soft after each use.CONS: I don't know if you can really call it light. It's light in comparison to regular Olay facial lotion but still not the lightest I've ever experienced. (That accolade would go to Neutrogena with sunscreen.) I found myself sweating a little after I'd applied this.4 STARS: I really liked this lotion. I felt like it gave my skin a healthy glow.", "I've used Oil of Olay for dry skin many times. It helps but never seems to finish the job even after weeks of daily use. So I wanted to try this version. It leaves my skin feeling soft but I seem to be back where I started by the next day. So this is a temporary solution for me. I think it works best when you are going out for the evening or to an appointment where you need to look your best. It does have a strong fragrance.", "\"My general feeling about moisturizers and hydrators is that they should be inexpensive.  After all, their primary function is to keep your skin supple, ideally without blocking your pores and causing an allergic reaction.  Many high quality lotions exist that perform exactly this function, and they do so quite well for a moderate price.  Thus, every time I see a new, relatively expensive lotion, I tend to roll my eyes.  Just what phenomenal value does this new product bring that justifies its price?This lotion actually has one significant advantage over all other lotions I have used.  This lotion has a really excellent feel to it, unlike any other lotion I have ever used.  Indeed, I want to keep putting it on because it feels, to me, unique.  The lotion has a kind of gel feeling to it, yet it is not oily.  Olay claims that the lotion leaves your skin with a satiny feel, and I can attest to that.  Rarely to do I find myself fascinated by the way a lotion feels on my skin, but in the case of this lotion, I am fascinated.  It appears that Olay's marketing department was dead on with their description of this product.The odor of this product is quite mild, to me.  However, as I have noticed many times, some people find some odors quite intense, and others do not.  Just because I think the odor of this lotion is mild, apparently some people find the odor so intense as to be obnoxious.  I can only assume there is some chemical in this lotion, of which there are many, to which some people are sensitive.  Unfortunately, the only way to know whether you find this lotion annoying is to try it yourself.I found it amusing that this lotion does not have any advertised capability to block ultraviolet rays.  However, I believe an SPF for most lotions is a waste of money and leads to a false sense of security.  In order for sun blocks to be effective, the sun block needs to be put on thickly, and most people do not leave thick lotion on their skin; they rub it in.  Once the lotion has been spread to the point where it is no longer visible to the naked eye, the SPF value is usually so miniscule that you may as well not have had any SPF value in the first place.  Please do not be misled by SPF in any product that is not a sunblock, appropriately applied.  Most people will not find much SPF value in any product that is primarily a lotion, with a sunblock as a side benefit.  Of course, many people do not apply and maintain sunblock appropriately anyway, so even a high SPF sunblock may be ineffective.One problem with any product that you put on your skin that contains chemicals, and this product contains a lengthy list of chemicals, is that the product can cause irritation or breaking out.  Unfortunately, it appears that this product does cause irritation for some people.  As with the odor, the only way to know whether you are sensitive to this product is to try it.I only know of two drawbacks to this product (overlooking possible objections to odor and irritation, neither of which affects me).  First, it seems that the \"\"satiny\"\" feel is so addictive that I have a tendency to want to keep applying it.  I consider that a drawback because of the second drawback, which is the price.  I try to avoid putting prices into a review because prices are subject to constant change, and prices are thus meaningless.  However, I can point out that dollars per ounce of lotion makes any lotion so priced relatively expensive in comparison to the alternatives.  So this lotion provides a perfect conjunction from a seller's perspective:  the product is addictive, to me, and the product is expensive.  However, considering the cost, I suspect that my addiction to this product is one that I will break quickly.Olay makes many fine products, and I think this product is a perfect fit with Olay.  This lotion is high quality, and it seems to do exactly what Olay claims it will do.  Now Olay needs to figure out how to sell this product in larger quantities for a lower price.  Once they do these things, they will not have a good product; they will have a great product.Enjoy!\"", "I've never been a big fan of Olay products.  There is nothing that completely turns me off about this product but there is also nothing that excites me.Did not irritate my sensitive skins but...  did not feel like it did a lot for me either.  I only used it a couple of days but I don't know if I would trust it for long term use given my skin.I would be happier if it would lose the smell.If you are looking for a moistener that is unscented I would highly recommendSimple Hydrating Light Moisturizer, 4.2 Ounce.  Both products don't have sun protection which is a draw back for the Simple moisturizer however I've been using the Simple products for about two weeks and have been THRILLED with how my skin looks and feels.", "I am a big fan of Olay and have been happy with almost every product I bought from them - at least two dozen different kinds.This time my skin had a bit of an issue.First of all, the good:- Long lasting- Light feel- Matte finish which can cover up a bit with out looking fake.The neutral:- The scent is pretty strong, although pleasant.The bad:- I broke out a little with this, maybe due to what ever &#34;matte finish&#34; they used.", "I am enjoying this Lotion from Olay.  I've long been a fan of their products and this lotion is soft and leaves my skin feeling incredibly smooth.  It's getting rid of my winter dry skin.The scent is a little strong - almost overpowering - and is not so great for my allergies when I use it on my face.  As a result, even though it's supposed to be for your face and neck, I've been using it on my ashy (no longer ashy!) elbows this winter.It does feel more like a gel than a traditional lotion, but once it's on, it's just soft and smooth.So, though I won't personally be using it on my face (again, the scent is too much), a little is going a long way on my arms and elbows.", "Oh my, another Olay moisturizer with a strong fragrance.  From using other Olay moisturizers over the last few years, I had the notion in my head that they all were fragrance free.  But in one month, I have encountered two Olay moisturizers with fragrances.  One was so strong, it gave me a horrid sinus headache.  This Fresh Effects' fragrance is not that strong and it does dissipate.  I use it at night.  It works fabulously on my skin, as many of the Olay moisturizers do.  My skin instantly absorbs it and feels very soft.  I noticed right away, too, after using it for just a couple of nights, that my skin during the day looks smoother and . . . brighter!", "If you typically utilize Olay products and have no issues, you likely can use this product.  However, my sensitive skin broke out after a few days of use of this product.  Those few days I used the satin finish lotion, I did notice that it goes on smoothly and really does seem to give me a nice smooth look. It really reminds me of some silicone based stuff I used to use.  It works well under make-up. I simply cannot use this product because it made me break out so profoundly. Historically speaking, I have had the same result with just about any Olay product I have tried.", "I like Olay products and do like this one but it leaves just a slight greasy feel after application.  The fragrance is wonderful and it does a great job at making your skin feel soft and smooth.  It lasts quite a long time so no need to replace every couple of hours like you need to do with some other lotions.  I will be using this more this summer after laying out in the sun to help keep my skin from peeling.  Gotta have me a nice tan and I think this will help quite a bit."], "Gamma": [1.0], "Beta": [[0.03934480622410774, 0.043381545692682266, 0.043258827179670334, 0.041138917207717896, 0.03717260807752609, 0.044340986758470535, 0.05054376646876335, 0.04467625543475151, 0.040529511868953705, 0.04290232062339783, 0.04368066415190697, 0.04087606817483902, 0.041458819061517715, 0.03870239481329918, 0.039653751999139786, 0.03929311782121658, 0.040715038776397705, 0.04189557954668999, 0.040123894810676575, 0.04333262890577316, 0.03952478989958763, 0.039281681180000305, 0.04265543445944786, 0.041516609489917755]]}
