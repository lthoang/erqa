"], "reviews": ["Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream Skin Perfecting Tinted Moisturizer with Sunscreen is a great multitasker!  It moisturizes my skin, protects it with SPF, and evens out my skintone so my foundation doesn't need to work as hard.  I really like that Olay offers a few different shades for their Bb Cream, because I have very fair skin, especially here in the wintertime, and those brands that go for a one-shade-suits-all approach can sometimes be just dark enough that I have that telltale Oopma-Loompa line at the jaw.  That doesn't happen with this product.I think this Bb Cream performs beautifully.  It has a pleasant scent, and is gentle enough for my skin.  This is a winner, in my book!", "Contact dermatitis is not a good thing.I chose Olay Fresh Effects Bb Cream! Skin Perfecting Moisturizer with Sunscreen-Light to Medium because beauty balms (BBs) are the new big thing in skin creams, or so the magazines would have us believe.  So, when I was offered the opportunity to try the BB from Olay, I jumped at the chance.  Let's just say it i may have made a mistake, albeit one that is not life-threatening.The cream is a light beige-ish color, and is fairly thick but smooth.  The smell is noticeable, but not overpowering to my nose, but may be off-putting to some individuals.  The active ingredients on the tube are sunscreens, and the instructions say to reapply every two hours-which, to me, defeats the purpose of a 24 hour moisturizing cream.  Of course it will provide 24 hour moisture if you reapply it every two hours!Anyway, I washed and toned my skin, then squeezed out some of the bb cream onto my fingertips.  It was very nice feeling, almost silky, which is good, right?  I mean it is touted as being able to smooth your skin.  I apply the cream to my face, and blend it into my skin.  This takes a little work, as I am not particularly dark complected, nor am I particularly fair-I am generally in the light-medium category, but this cream was not a good match at all for my skin tone.  I had to really blend blend blend so I didn't look like I was wearing foundation three shades to pale.Once I got the color minimized, I relaxed a bit before checking if my skin felt smooth and looked brighter and refreshed.  It did look brighter-actually reddish in color, but I chalked that up to overenthusiastic blending.  Then my skin started to tingle-refreshing!  Then it began to burn- uh oh.  I look in the mirror, and I see the reddened skin (from the blending, you know), and little bumps.  All over my face.  This is not good, I think to myself, so I wash my face, thereby removing the skin benefiting cream, and take some generic Benedryl.When I awoke the next morning, my face looked fairly normal, so I decide to give the cream another go.  I wash my face and use toner, then I craftily wait fifteen or twenty minutes before applying the BB (maybe my toner irritated my skin the previous day).  I use a small amount of the BB, and don't blend as much (so I looked a bit blotchy-I wasn't going anywhere anytime soon).  Once again, the redness and tingling sensation begins, and the bumps appear in greater quantity than before.  Once more I wash my face, removing all traces of the BB cream, and pop another antihistamine.In conclusion, this BB cream is not for me.  Bumpy blotchy uneven skin is supposed to be reduced by judicious application of cosmetic creams, not caused by them.  Other than the unpleasant skin reaction, I like the way the cream felt on my fingers, and the smell was tolerable.  It may work for others, but not for me or my not so sensitive skin.", "I've tried several different brands of BB cream in the past. I really like the minimal makeup affect and the fact that it gives your complexion an even-glowing tone. But not all BB creams are alike. I had high hopes for the new Olay BB cream. First of all the smell is kind of medicinal-which is not to my liking. The consistency of the cream is good; not too thick or thin, spreads well on face. I compared the light/medium color to Garnier version and Olay is much lighter. So much lighter that I would wear it in winter, rather then summer. All BB creams make my combination skin a little shiny, but when I use a primer it works much better. Overall, this isn't the worst BB cream I've tried or the best, but at $20 a pop I would rather get Garnier version. Garnier smells better, has better color and is cheaper.", "I didn't like this product the first time I tried it.  I've been using a mineral foundation base that goes on very silky.  This cream is thicker, and is almost a bit sticky as I smooth it over my face.  I didn't like this initial impression.But I did like the level of coverage.  It's very sheer coverage, that evens out color variation but isn't a coat of paint.  I have some freckles and small age spots, and they are visible through the cream, but the contrast has been reduced significantly.  I think this is a much more natural appearance than a foundation that makes your whole face the exact same color, from hairline to chin.I also really like the moisturizing.  My skin is noticeably softer at the end of the day when I've worn this cream, rather than my normal moisturizer plus foundation routine.  The moisturizer helps with the fine lines, and the color doesn't sink into the larger wrinkles like some foundations well.This cream has 'grown on me', and now it's what I use most days, even though I didn't love it at first.", "\"This product is your typical - you get what you pay for... While I don't love this product as much as department store brands (i.e. Clinique), this BB cream is not bad and is a fraction of the cost of those bigger name brands.  The ones I have tried in the department store have more coverage - which I need - and therefore I use those under my regular foundation on days that I need a little bit more camouflage than usual.  The Olay brand's does not have the coverage that I would like, but then again it lives up to it's name as a \"\"tinted moisturizer\"\".  I would say it does well on the moisturizing level and it does not break out my face or cause it to sting like some brands do (I have very sensitive skin and usually do not fair well with cheaper brands).  It has added sunscreen, so that is a plus for most.  I also have very fair skin, and because this is only slightly tinted, it does not show up as orange or pink on my face like some do - it blends very well into my skin tone.  I also have huge pores on my nose - it helps very little in this area - I have to use other pore-minimizing products for that problem.SUMMARY:Pros - good moisturizer, contains sunscreen, ok for my sensitive skin, blends well into my fair skin toneCons - doesn't do much to cover problem areas such as acne, enlarged poresI wouldn't call this a \"\"BB cream\"\" as most I have used cover all the areas of concern for me, but I would say it is a good \"\"moisturizer\"\" that I may purchase again only for that reason alone.\"", "\"I was really hoping this Olay BB Cream would be a great product since it is much cheaper than my current BB cream. Unfortunately, it does not live up to my expectations. I knew that it wouldn't be as good when I saw that you are supposed to apply it every 2 hours and 15 minutes before sun exposure. Most BB Creams are designed to last all day.I have oily skin and as a result I am not a huge fan of a lot of tinted moisturizers. I know that the description of this product says BB Cream AND Tinted Moisturizer (which a product should be one or the other, not both), but I wanted to try it anyhow. I was hoping that it was not greasy. The second I put it on my skin, I felt oily and gross. I continued to apply it just to see if it made my skin look any better. It didn't. It made it look as oily as it felt and it didn't really do much for my uneven skin. I had to wash it off 15 minutes later and my face still felt gross.The supposed benefits of Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream and my results:*Refreshes- It did not refresh for me since it made me feel dirty and oily*Brightens- If by \"\"Brightens\"\" they mean shiny, then it did do this*Evens Tone- definitely not. My skin was still uneven looking*Hydrates- It did hydrate my skin into an oil slick*Smoothes- It made all of my skin oily, I guess technically it did smooth it*Protects- With only SPF 15 and directions to apply every 2 hours, I could not trust this alone to protect my pale skin.This product may work for some people with dry skin. It just did not work for me. If you want a BB cream that will truly do all of these things, has a higher spf and you only have to apply ONCE a day; trySmashbox Camera Ready BB Cream SPF 35 Light/Medium(warning: Smashbox BB Cream is expensive, but it works great for oily skin).\"", "\"I love BB creams.Stila Stay All Day 10-in-1 HD Beauty Balmis a perfect example of a BB that really lives up to the hype.Dr. Jart+ Black Label Detox BB Beauty Balmis a relatively new one, but, WOW it has really gorgeous results.BB creams are supposed to hydrate but this left my skin really, really shiny ... \"\"greasy\"\" looking. And, even though I used a small amount, when the wind blew, my hair literally stuck to my face. Ick. And, the smell is strong (floral? grandmotherly?) and totally unnecessary.I thought this would be a nice, inexpensive addition to the collection (maybe for days when I'm just running errands), but I cannot think of a single positive aspect to using it.If you have a chance, pop over to Sephora or Ulta and try a few BB cremes from a few different cosmetic companies. Then, return here to make your purchase. (You will often get a better deal here).\"", "\"This is my first experience with a \"\"BB\"\" product.  The texture of the lotion is satiny smooth.  It has a tint to it, which is pretty sheer.  If you're looking for foundation-level coverage, this isn't it.  It does, however, blend in nicely and even out skin tone to some degree, with basic coverage.  I use it as a base and then touch up with concealer where needed.  I usually finish with a light dusting of a mineral foundation powder.  I would describe my skin as a light medium, so this color was fine for me.  There is a fragrance to this product.  I wouldn't exactly call it a pleasant fragrance, but it isn't terribly strong or long-lasting.  I have break-out prone skin but I did not experience any break-outs while using Skin Perfecting Tinted Moisturizer.  The lotion has sunscreen, SPF 15, which is minimal but probably adequate.  Overall, I liked the look and feel of this product and will certainly consider purchasing it.\"", "This cream is light and airy, and smells great! Most tinted moisturizers that I've used feel more like make-up than face cream but not this one. The scent is sweet, without a trace of make-up smell to it. It doesn't clog my pores with the tint, but rather blends effortlessly across my skin with no streaking.I love that it moisturizes my skin at the same time as providing me with a smooth-looking complexion. I have fair skin, and I found that this light to medium color was perfect for me--not too dark where it shows a line between my face and neck.I am very pleased with this product!", "I have to wonder if the formula has been changed since some of these reviews were written because it seems like we're reviewing two different products. I've tried several BB creams, and this is by far my favorite. Some reviewers say it is thin and greasy, but this is the thickest BB cream I've used yet with the most coverage, and while other BB creams left my face very shiny (to the point I had to either use mattifier underneath or powder over top), this one does not. It is a bit tacky after first putting it on (so put your eye makeup on first), but once it sets, it stays put. It's the longest-lasting BB cream I've used. When I have it on, my skin looks smooth and even and luminous, and my pores are noticeably minimized. The color also suits me perfectly. I have sensitive skin prone to break-outs (still, at age 38!) and I have yet to have a problem with this or any other Olay product. I love the concept of BB creams and the ease of use, and I am so glad I finally found the perfect one for me!", "Overall, this is a good product.  It has a nice consistency as it goes on, and does moisturize, not simply tint the skin.  There is a light fragrance to it that is pleasant - not overpowering, nor is it medicinal/clinical in nature.Another positive aspect is that it evens out skin tone/complexion - but as expected, not as thoroughly as a true base/foundation would.  However, it therefore has a potentially more natural look.The one aspect that is not ideal is that I am very fair, and this is a bit too dark.  There is a noted contrast between my face when I'm wearing this, and my neck - which somewhat defeats the purpose of a tinted moisturizer.If they were to add a lighter shade to their product selection, then I would seek this out for sure - but would not buy it again in this formulation.", "I have fair skin, dry in the winter and oily in the summer and prone to breakouts with a lot of products, so I'm picky about what I put on my face.  I gave this a try since I trust Oil of olay products and I wanted some coverage without using foundation since most foundations just feel too heavy to me.  When I first put it on I was worried about the fragrance, I usually buy fragrance free just so I don't break out, however, after a week of use I have not broken out.  I also always have little flakes of dry skin on my forehead in the winter, but after a couple days of using this they are gone!  It felt really light to me and was easy to blend into the skin.  It does seem to offer a bit of coverage while still feeling natural.  I just put a bit of powder over it.  I really like the way this makes my skin look and feel, I'm not sure if that will change in the summer when my skin gets greasier, but until then I'll continue to use this product.", "After having used a few of the Olay Fresh Effects, I am in love with this collection. However, of all the products, I have to say the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is probably the worst.With the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream, a little goes a long way. So, first of all, be careful how much you use. The first time I tried this product, I got a little zealous with my application, and wasted more than I should have.Greasy. Unlike with the moisturizer that glides on silky, and absorbs into the skin quickly, the BB cream has an almost greasy feel. Sadly, that feeling did not go away in a minutes like I had hoped.As far as coverage, the Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream does as well as some of the other products I have used.All in all, I didn't love this BB Cream.", "\"Because I have a 50+ year history having acne rosacea, I am always on the hunt for a product which will moisturize or cover up problems without aggravating my skin.  According to Amazon's product page, Fresh Effects promises to \"\"perfect\"\" in these ways:  \"\"Refreshes, Brightens, Evens Tone, Hydrates, Smoothes, Protects.  All-in-one solution for instantly brighter-looking, smoother-feeling, more even skin tone.\"\"  The shade I have is Light to Medium, and I have very light skin.This is my experience with Fresh Effects in using it daily for the past week and a half.The good:  Even though there is a definite tint to the lotion, it blends right in with my fair skin completely, not leaving any discernible color cast or lines on my skin, meaning I can just \"\"spot\"\" places on my face or use it all over without looking as if I have applied makeup.  My skin does feel smoother and hydrated.  With SPF 15, I can wear this in the garden (with a hat, of course) and have protection from the sun.  There is a very light, pleasant, flowery fragrance.  Most importantly to me, with daily use, Fresh Effects has not caused any acne outbreaks.The not-so-good:  In my case, as far as \"\"instantly brighter-looking\"\" and \"\"more even skin tone\"\" are concerned, these claims are overreaching.  Because of the rosacea, my skin tends to be blotchy and red in various places.  Full application of Fresh Effects did absolutely nothing to tone down, or smooth out, or blend these color disparities, to my disappointment.  What Fresh Effects does do is lightly cover up some of my skin breakouts, but know that by no means is this a full cover-up of the blemish(es).  A side benefit is that covering up the existing acne problems with this product does not lengthen or obstruct the healing process the way some stick cover-ups can do.  Second, and frankly, I really do not know what \"\"brighter-looking\"\" skin looks like, but to me, my skin does not look any different as a result of using this product.In sum, Fresh Effects is of value to me because of the sun protection, moisturization, and the fact that it will not set off my acne condition.  Insofar as toning down the rosacea, or showing me any other type of \"\"skin perfection\"\" my answer is:  not really, making this product way too pricey at $20.  Actually, the packaging concentrates primarily on the moisturizing and sunscreen aspects anyway.\"", "\"As with nearly all Oil of Olay products, I love this one.  This is a non-greasy foundation-esque moisturizer.  I have worn this and a bit of powder and skipped foundation entirely.  It's especially nice because it has a clean scent, and when I say scent it's not overpowering or highly noticeable but yet it's pleasant, far more pleasant then any other foundation of any type.  I did not find this product to be greasy or unappealing.  It feels like a thinner version of Oil of Olay's serums with tint.  This is not a little bit of tint in my opinion.  I have swapped out my foundation for this.  Technically BB cream stands for \"\"blemish balm, blemish base\"\" so anyone expecting this to be like a tinted lotion is just incorrect, that is not what it is.I do not have acne, but like most women I do have uneven skin tone and some days I just want a lighter foundation or base.  This is the ticket.  I live in Florida where spf is a must.  I love this product and hope BB creams catch on and stay.  This item has the quality I've come to expect and respect from Oil of Olay.  The description states \"\"mix, match and layer\"\" for your own personal perfection and this is correct.  This may not be for everyone but I love it.  It's clean feeling, soaks into my skin and keeps it soft and smooth all day and is protecting my skin as well.  Some day's my skin feels blah and I layer over this with my powder foundation, but some day's this is all I need.  Even on my down day's my skin is getting moisturized and protected from the brutal sun in Florida.If you have a question that hasn't been answered, ask it. I'll be happy to respond.\"", "Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is a very good product.  As soon as I opened the box I noticed that the tube is double the size of designer department store brands.  This BB cream has an SPF 15 compared to the SPF 50 of the designer brands but otherwise it does a good job.  It has a nice light weight, is non-irritating (even around the eyes), and the color looks good too.  My skin tone did look better, and it had a bit of a glow after applying this product.  I also love that it is a light weight foundation, SPF, and moisturizer all in one.", "I wanted to really love Olay's fresh effects BB cream. The product is a tinted moisturizer that is supposed to be used for extra sun protection. I am fair, and always wear sunscreen under my makeup foundation ( I freckle easily, and find this evens out my skin tone). I was looking forward to receiving this product, and using it with my regular makeup as a base.I really liked some parts of this product.  It is a good moisturizer, and went on easily, with no clumping.  It did not cause any type of irritation to my eyes.  However, when it comes to tinting-the product does not have enough of a tint for me to ever wear this as a foundation.  I found that it did not even out my skin tone, and that I had to use base in addition to this product to even out my skin tone.  As I have previously said I do have freckles, and freckle easily, and I am always in search of a base that makes my skin light and even in tone.  This simply was not it.  I would use this as a sunscreen at the beach, if I wanted a little tinting as well, but I am not sure if it is even good for that as it is only spf 15 ( I prefer at least an spf 45 on my face at the beach).  This is something that I was given as a free sample, and not something that I would buy.", "\"This tinted moisturizer works great.  I don't need much makeup on my face, so this is ideal.  I can also use it as a foundation, then add a little make up over it if I want to look a little more flawless.  It's got a sunscreen, so will help ward off those aging effects.  I also have been using it on the tops of my almost 60 year old hands.  It softens the skin and gives them a bit of a dewy look.  I'm getting the age spots on my hands, so the sun screen will help stop that, or slow it down a bit.I really like the feel  and look on my face and the tops of my hands.  A great product, if you're not looking for made up make up look.  The effects are subtle, but nice.  I like the smell and can only say one negative thing.  I have olive skin, that more on the dark side of medium.  I should have probably got something darker than the \"\"light to medium\"\".\"", "This light sunscreen with tint provides a lot of coverage with a little product.  I found that I can use this almost as a primer underneath my mineral powder for full coverage.  I love the way it feels and smells.  This is going to be an awesome product for the hotter summer months, but for the dryer winter, I think I need something with a bit more moisture.  I found this very easy to apply and it melts right into your skin and provides the right amount of coverage even for *older* skin. I think if you have oily skin this product will be a perfect match since it doesn't seem greasy at all.  I can't wait until the weather warms up to try it them since I know it will be perfect for summer coverage.", "I was really excited to try this new BB cream from Olay, but the fragrance in it was a little too strong for my skin. It did give a nice dewy finish to my face and made it look smoother and more even-toned. It didn't cake, it blended easily and the moisture was just right. The instructions on it were those for a sunscreen, so I take it there's heavy SPF in it and it needs to be applied and reapplied accordingly.  The color I received was called Light to Medium, though I think calling it Light would be more accurate. It made me look a little pastey. I hope they make a fragrance-free BB in their Regenerist line, too. I'd recommend this for younger users with normal to dry, not too sensitive skin.", "As a woman of a certain age, I am constantly on the hunt for a foundation that provides coverage without exacerbating the laugh lines I have earned over the years. Olay Fresh Effects is a tinted moisturizer, which made me a little hesitant at first. My experience in the past has been that this type of product is heavy on the moisturizer, light on the tinted, leaving me looking like a greasy mess a few hours after application.Olay Fresh Effects has a little less in the coverage area than I would like to have, but on the positive side, it blends well, doesn't collect in the wrinkly areas and doesn't leave my face looking and feeling like an oil slick. As an added bonus, my skin feels softer, and the product has a nice scent, not overly sunscreenish smelling. I am hoping the Skin Perfecting part of the program will negate the need for a little bit stronger coverage.I really like the way the product goes on, and how my skin feels after a week of use. I will continue to use it, combined with a little concealer here and there.", "If you typically utilize Olay products and have no issues, you likely can use this product.  However, my sensitive skin broke out after a few days of use of this product.  Those few days I used the bb cream, I did notice that the coverage was good and created a pretty flawless look.  I simply cannot use this product because it made me break out so profoundly. Historically speaking, I have had the same result with just about any Olay product I have tried.", "This cream does an excellent job of moisturing your skin. It goes on smooth and is quickly absorbed without being greasy or sticky. It has a sunscreen so it's good for every day use, and has a slight tint to balance out imperfections in your complexion I would have given it a higher score but it is very expensive, and that is why I cannot give it 5 stars.", "As much as I love Oil of Olay products, they're simply not great with my skin. I have sensitive skin, very pale because of Irish heritage. The Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream goes on smooth, not very heavy, but after two days use, my skin was breaking out in horrible fashion. I stuck with it hoping it was just a case of my skin adjusting, but a week later, I have breakouts from forehead to chin. I ended up stopping all use and the breakouts have reduced.It's a shame. It's not really the product's fault. I loved the feel of it, the tinting wasn't much, it didn't hide any imperfections or blemishes. Having sunscreen was nice too. The scent was light and fresh, but in the end, it's just no good for my skin. For those whose skin doesn't have an issue, it's a great product. If you're skin is sensitive though, you might want to start small and see how your skin reacts first.", "\"First, a little background -- I'm middle aged, with fair, sensitive skin, I don't work outside the home, so I don't need to \"\"make up\"\" most of the time.  Something like this Olay Fresh Effects BB Cream is perfect for me most days, especailly because it contains a sunscreen.  I just smooth it on after my shower over my face and neck, slap on a little blush and I look perfectly presentable.  If I'm going out, I add a little foundation to it, mix it together and smooth it on for a little more coverage.  The Olay Fresh Effects does have a slight melon smell and a warning to stop using it if you develop a rash, so be aware of that.  As I said, my skin is pretty sensitive and I've had no problems with it after using it for a few months.  Would I purchase this item in a store?
