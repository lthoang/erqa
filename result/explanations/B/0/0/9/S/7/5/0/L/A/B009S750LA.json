Everyone's saying some kinda issue and not everything is perfect. Go ahead and buy it.", "Purchased this unit overall happy with it.Went to my office and found they had installed a Dell system vastly superior in respect of aligning screens.I bet it was much more expensive, I stick with 4 stars for what it does for the price.", "Do I need to say more?  The unit comes together quite nicely.  just be warned that the screw that needs to tighten the arm to the post needs some 'elbow grease' to tighten sufficiently to not rotate, though it seems to hold nicely (vertically) even if not tightened all the way.  Also keep in mind that you'll need a bit of room at the edge of the table where the post mounts in order to turn the allen wrench efficiently.  Otherwise you might get stuck with a sore back for leaning over from the other side of the table. Great sturdy mount for screens (I have dual 24&#34; monitors).  Recommend to anyone needing (well, wanting, really...) a dual monitor mount.", "It's a good mount and beats Monoprice prices (rare). My only gripe is minor and probably doesn't apply to you. My office has these European tables that have a stylistic incline on all four edges and the mount could not get a grip on the edge. I ended up making a &#34;grip&#34; using styrofoam and cardboard.During setup, I stripped the head of one of the mounting screws and lost another. I would have appreciated if they included some extras.If you would like to adjust the mount's position, you need to remove the caps off the bottom of the arms. These caps can easily be removed by gripping the square edge with two fingers and pulling. The caps look like you need to use a screwdriver to pull them off using the circular region that sticks out of the cap. This will not work. (Hopefully I described this well so you don't make the same mistake)", "This thing is a monster.  Heavy duty steel construction and solid connection points and joints.  It takes a bit of effort to tighten the joints if you need to but not that much effort.  I was able to attach mine to a shelf over my work bench upside down.  Probable not the suggested use, but it has worked like a charm and is very sturdy feeling.  This is a great buy for the price.", "I was going to use this at home but the college I work at needed it more. It now sits on the Chancellors podium and he could not be more happy with this stand. He can swing one monitor 180 degrees to show what he wants others to see.", "I had a horrible time with this stand. yes it's made of strong steel and it's very affordable, but i got a dud. Mine came with a missing tension screw that secures the arm to the pole.  I only realized this when i had already installed it on the desk.The stand comes with a baggie of screws, tools, and bolts. The Tension screw my kit was missing was not included in this baggie on purpose. It was supposed to be pre-installed on the arm, but mine was not.  I went to the hardware store to try and fix it myself but it's something totally custom that cannot be replicated. Sure i can match the threads but the screw would not bottom out, so it would never tighten.The base also would not fit on my desk. The backplane on my desk was not recessed enough for this to get a good grip. Additionally, the hoop loop bolts that tighten the Mast onto the desk are HUGE. This makes rotating them in tight spots very hard. I would say they are 2&#34; thick. Something slimmer and not as wide is desperately needed.The Tilt Bolts were also very hard to work with.you would tighten them, and the screens would follow your bolt rotation, and then you'd have to adjust the screen, and repeat.I thank amazon for allowing me to return it and sending me a alternative stand with overnight shipping.  Instructions are also very sparse and there are no video's on their website for this particular model.Can't recommend.", "I currently have a 24&#34; and 21&#34; hanging off this stand.  I can't believe I didn't order this earlier.  I now have a ton of space under my monitors.  It's very easy to put together and comes with a extra long hex wrench to give you leverage when tightening bolts.  Except for the end caps and cable clips, everything is made of the steel.I didn't have any of the problems with my 24&#34; tilting forward after tightening.  It holds it securely.  Also, the cable routing is a very nice touch and improves the look of the monitors greatly.  Surprisingly, all my cables were long enough to be re-routed.If you want a clean looking deskspace, I highly recommend this.", "Great value.  It is really well made and sturdy.  The only issue is nowhere in the instructions do they tell you how to access the adjustment nuts on the swivels (lift the caps).", "I really like this dual-monitor desk mount. I bought it on a hunch, it was one of three that I found and just decided it was what I needed. I have two 24&#34; monitors, but instead of getting a different mount made for &#34;up to 2x 24&#34;s&#34;, I went with this one that said &#34;up to 2x 27&#34;s&#34;. That few extra inches gives you more room to adjust them to specific angles, if you like it that way.Installation was straight forward. Only took about 30 minutes. The thing is very adjustable, at every arm and elbow you can use the hex wrench to tighten or loosen the grip. You can pitch the monitor angles left, right, up, down, and move the whole thing up and down the pole itself. Feels very tightly snug to the desk too, I'm not worried about it slipping off or anything.Overall, great mount. I was going to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish the arms were just a bit longer reaching, but then it would've been for 30&#34; monitors so that's really not a problem with this mount itself.", "I have this mounted on a glass top desk with a 27&#34; and a 24&#34; samsung monitors, i do baby it a bit because i worry about the tension on the glass. I should probably do the wood trick that was recommended but so far i dont have any issues. It looks really cool, the arms move around nicely or stay snug depending on what you are doing. I was apprehensive at first because of the price and the whole mount on glass thing but im really glad i ended up getting it. This thing rules.", "Works well with my two 24&#34; monitors. Frees up lots of space underneath them. I like the long arms (relative to my 24&#34; displays), which allow me a lot of flexibility in positioning the monitors. They rotate easily for when I want to switch to portrait mode. They're a lot sturdier than the cruddy stands that came with my monitors. Being able to adjust the height to the optimal level is also great.On the down side, adjusting the height requires a hex key (included) and it is a little difficult because of the weight of everything. One of the built-in cable ties on mine arrived broken. Tilting vertically is a bit tricky as the monitors tend to want to droop even though it seems like I've tightened the bolt quite a bit. Getting the displays mounted is also a bit of a pain (best done with two people).Overall, considering the price, I think it's a great monitor stand.", "Maximum arm length is 14.5&#34; each, pole center to VESA center. It would depend on monitor bezel size, but I am using two 28&#34; i-Inc iH282 monitors without a problem.It is nice that it comes with various spare parts: short and long screws, spacers, wire guides, and spare cover caps.The one significant issue I had was the arms kept sliding down the pole even when it was tightened to the limit, so shims had to be used. (The monitor weights are well within the limits). Perhaps the plastic inserts were defective. Maybe it would have worked better if the inserts could be made sticky.I think this is a better monitor stand than other desk-mounts of comparable price. Others I have are flimsy, though they work fine for smaller monitors.It can be used as a single monitor stand as well, by removing unneeded arms, if you plan on adding extra monitors in the future."], "Gamma": [0.12887521088123322, 0.13068217039108276, 0.12986618280410767, 0.13068217039108276, 0.13068217039108276, 0.13068217039108276, 0.08784772455692291, 0.13068217039108276], "Beta": [[0.151602640748024, 0.012482328340411186, 0.11618500202894211, 0.11751032620668411, 0.12707480788230896, 0.0007148886215873063, 0.0008348678238689899, 0.18757764995098114, 0.14496560394763947, 0.00012654410966206342, 0.13355228304862976, 0.00722750648856163, 0.00014554049994330853], [0.15162311494350433, 0.012360427528619766, 0.11650824546813965, 0.11768972873687744, 0.12741656601428986, 0.0006963370251469314, 0.000820554094389081, 0.18706214427947998, 0.14472922682762146, 0.0001233575021615252, 0.13365478813648224, 0.0071738408878445625, 0.0001416218583472073], [0.1515813022851944, 0.012418224476277828, 0.11655176430940628, 0.11774313449859619, 0.1274370551109314, 0.0006992223206907511, 0.0008238950395025313, 0.18689760565757751, 0.14472045004367828, 0.00012466422049328685, 0.13366271555423737, 0.007196787744760513, 0.00014318882313091308], [0.15162311494350433, 0.012360427528619766, 0.11650824546813965, 0.11768972873687744, 0.12741656601428986, 0.0006963370251469314, 0.000820554094389081, 0.18706214427947998, 0.14472922682762146, 0.0001233575021615252, 0.13365478813648224, 0.0071738408878445625, 0.0001416218583472073], [0.15162311494350433, 0.012360427528619766, 0.11650824546813965, 0.11768972873687744, 0.12741656601428986, 0.0006963370251469314, 0.000820554094389081, 0.18706214427947998, 0.14472922682762146, 0.0001233575021615252, 0.13365478813648224, 0.0071738408878445625, 0.0001416218583472073], [0.15162311494350433, 0.012360427528619766, 0.11650824546813965, 0.11768972873687744, 0.12741656601428986, 0.0006963370251469314, 0.000820554094389081, 0.18706214427947998, 0.14472922682762146, 0.0001233575021615252, 0.13365478813648224, 0.0071738408878445625, 0.0001416218583472073], [0.1499563753604889, 0.014392598532140255, 0.11567895114421844, 0.11758770048618317, 0.12702590227127075, 0.001442410983145237, 0.0016075781313702464, 0.1871732920408249, 0.14120787382125854, 0.0002543781010899693, 0.13302960991859436, 0.010367720387876034, 0.0002755926107056439], [0.15162311494350433, 0.012360427528619766, 0.11650824546813965, 0.11768972873687744, 0.12741656601428986, 0.0006963370251469314, 0.000820554094389081, 0.18706214427947998, 0.14472922682762146, 0.0001233575021615252, 0.13365478813648224, 0.0071738408878445625, 0.0001416218583472073]]}
