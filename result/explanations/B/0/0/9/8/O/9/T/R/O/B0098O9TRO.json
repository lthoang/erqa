They're both great. The 700T is my favorite, though. The i5 processor adds some welcome processing power. Windows 8 performs very well. It doesn't seem like a sluggish experience like I have seen with other Windows-based tablets. This has become my go-to laptop/portable device due to the convenient size and weight.", "My son, a software engineer, recently had the opportunity to try out the Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T. I'm writing this review based on notes that I took over the weekend regarding his brief encounter with this new Windows 8 based hybrid tablet computer. Before reviewing the computer, I would like to point out a few of the comments that he made regarding the Windows 8 platform. In his opinion; the highly anticipated Windows 8 was superb, but be prepared to spend a little time learning the new OS. Once learned, it's a very simple and well thought out design. There are many hidden controls on Windows 8, which in his opinion is a good thing as it saves precious real estate. No doubt, Microsoft had this in mind when they designed their new OS. You simply move the cursor to the corner of the screen to find the out of sight controls. He found this to be very easy to learn and after a few minutes of use, highly intuitive. As a big Apple fan and iPad enthusiast, he was more than impressed with the Windows 8 OS. While requiring a little more learning time, it compares very favorably with OS X from Apple. As for the Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T; he absolutely loved it. The device comes with an impressive 11.6-in. touch LED that quickly attaches to a keyboard base. You simply push a button at the top of the keyboard to release the display screen. The HD screen is very impressive, and provides the capability for 1920 x 1080 resolution. The hybrid laptop/tablet computer weighs in at less than 2 pounds and comes with Intel's Core i5-3317U chip. It includes 4GB RAM and a 128GB SSD. Since the keyboard detaches from the main display in less than a second; this is a true hybrid device and in his opinion, the future of computing. This is a legitimate, fully functional laptop computer, and a fully functional tablet computer, similar to the iPad. In the full function keyboard mode, the device operates no differently than a regular laptop or desktop PC. The keyboard touch-pad is a breeze to use. With the keyboard detached, you have a fabulous tablet capable of performing virtually any task imaginable. Samsung thought of everything on this device, including a 2-megapixel HD front webcam and 8-megapixel HD back webcam. The 8-megapixel rear webcam allows for superb images and is a major step above the iPad. The built-in stereo speakers are quite impressive for a device of this size. There's also a headphone jack for external speakers or private listening. It comes with a wireless N connectivity, with ability to connect to older networks as well. It also sports a Micro HDMI, a USB 3.0 port and Micro SD slot. The tablet can be used with your fingers or with the S pen that comes with it. The bottom line is that this is a high-end, fully functional laptop/desktop/tablet computer, capable of doing just about anything, just about anywhere.Pros: Fully functional laptop or tablet computerSuperb Windows 8 OSKeyboard, touch-pad, or S Pen operationMagnificent high resolution HD screenLong lasting batterySuper fast Intel Core i5 processorMuch more functionality than iPad3G or 4G LTE compatibleReasonably priced for what you getCons: Slightly heavier than an iPad (Insignificant, especially when used without keyboard)Slightly longer learning curve than iPad (Insignificant)Final thoughts: This device is the future of computing. While the iPad is a revolutionary tablet; this device goes beyond the capabilities of the iPad and is an overall better computing system. There is virtually nothing that can't be done with this incredible new offering from Samsung and Microsoft. Apple will have a run for its money with the introduction of this amazing new hybrid laptop/notebook computer. One last note: I own the new 3rd generation iPad which I consider to be an excellent device. In my opinion; it has always been the standard to which others are trying to catch up to. From what my son has told me, the Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro 700T is capable of doing so much more than an iPad, that I may consider purchasing one. I honestly believe that the domination of the iPad in the tablet market will come to an end, as more and more hybrid devices such as this Samsung come on the market. Apple may actually have to play catch-up for a change.", "A top of the line tablet for a top of the line price, but it is a lot of fun, and has everything you could need or want in a touch screen, and or a high end laptop.  Samsung is on a roll with their creative products.", "This is a very powerful and useful hybrid.  The i5 processor runs everything very quickly and the battery lasts for around 6 hours.  I also has an S Pen and 1920x1280 screen that sets it apart from most of the others.  It also has dual band wireless so that it can connect at 2.4 or 5.0 thus potentially reducing wireless issues  It is sometimes available at Amazon Warehouse at a very reasonable price.The hybrid runs a full version of Win8.  Because of this, you are able to run any program.  In my opinion Win8 represents the best work that Microsoft has done on an operating system.  It is fast and intuitive once you spend a little time with it and start to lose old paradigms.  You find several comments about how it is not like Win7 and therefore a piece of garbage.  Sure it is not like Win7 but if you spend some time with it, I think you will like it better.", "\"What sets this apart from other offerings is the quality keyboard.  There are lots of competitors out there and I really don't understand reviews that claim it feels cheap, especially as compared to the Microsoft Surface Pro.  I like this more than the Surface Pro by miles: the keyboard is much nicer than even their \"\"Type\"\" keyboard, and if you spend any time typing up anything at all, your decision is made for you right there.  (Beyond that the offerings are almost identical in specs.)What would make this product better?  An i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, backlit keyboard... I also have a Dell XPS 12 with these, and that thing is insanely fast, just unbelievable, and the backlit keyboard is more desirable than I initially expected - as it happens I quite like computing with nothing but the TV across the room on: backlit keyboards are great for that! BUT that has no exansion slot, the keyboard isn't removeable, and it has fewer USB ports.  I'm having a hard time deciding which one to part with, but thought I'd throw this thing up a 5-star review: it's well built, expandable, and has a fantastic keyboard.  Don't be misled by online reviews that slag it in deference to the Surface Pro.  If you plan on typing anything, get this... (or that Dell).\"", "I chatted with Microsoft via there online chat support, and I called my local store November 12th and nobody had any idea when they might be getting the 700T in stock. I had read that people were getting them at their local Microsoft stores from the Q&A; section on Amazon discussions as well as from a few other forums. Apparently this tablet has a pretty large (and frustrated) following.I myself was just about to throw in the towel and think about maybe going with the Sony Duo Slider or buying a series 7 slate and downloading windows 8 to make it more usable. I really want the  active digitizer and the only reason why I didn't jump on the Sony Duo was because its Digitizer is the inferior N-Trig.Today on a whim I called my local Microsoft again and held my breath as the store clerk went to check to see if they had the 700T in stock. When they guy got back on the line and informed that YES THEY DID HAVE IT IN STOCK I almost keeled over!!!! After all this waiting I could finally get my hands on the elusive Samsung Ativ PC Pro! I asked the store clerk if I should RUN over because seeing how they are selling out like hot cakes online I figured they must be in store as well! He didn't seem to think they would sell out before the afternoon, but let me tell you I got in the car and booked it over there anyways!I wrote a quick review earlier but it was pretty useless so I am rewriting my review to see if I can more effectively give people some insights on this wonderful tablet. Here are my first impressions -Build Quality - I had read online that some people felt the build quality of the Ativ 700T was cheap. I disagree; while it is made of plastic I think it feels quite nice in my hands. I previously purchased a Series 7 slate and returned it because I disliked how wide it was and now I remember why I disliked it! in landscape mode the tablet is wonderful! But turn it to portrait and its pretty long and awkward to hold. However, since I use my ipad for reading and web surfing and I plan to use this for digital art and light photo editing I think the width will end up working in my favor. I also think that the design is improved over the series 7 slate. There is now a slot for the S-pen which is much more practical (though it also has caused major design changes for the s-pen over the pen that came with series 7 which I will talk about later) and its seems slimmer and lighter though I haven't actually compared the specs. I also like the black  color I think it looks more professional and less like a toy.S-Pen - As I mentioned above in order for the S-pen to fit into the unit Samsung has changed it significantly from the stylus that came with the series 7 slate. I liked the build quality of the series 7 stylus but it was useless to me if I couldn't keep it house in the unit. I think for long periods of writing I will see if the stylus from my intuos 6 tablet will work with the 700t. For my smaller hands I don't think I will experience too much discomfort while writing or drawing with the tiny stylus but for a man with large hands I think it would be uncomfortable quickly.The S-pen works great in the s-note ap! No lag and shows nice pressure sensitivity. However, I don't really think the s-not ap is that practical for storing all my drawings and prefer more mainstream ap's like one note and Corel Painter. So far I downloaded Corel Painter and did some quick sketches and the S-pen worked pretty good! I am not noticing very good pressure sensitivity I think its there but it is not as responsive as in S-note. I am going to try out art rage and some other programs and also experiment more with Corel and hopefully get some better results. However, the performance of Corel Painter was really good and I am very satisfied. I downloaded the one note ap in the microsoft store (free version) its not full one-note its and ap version of one-note -  its not great - performance wise there is no lag but its hard to navigate and I think the full version will be better and more familiar. However, I can't really complain when something is free.Performance wise I am pretty happy! The microsoft guy showed me computers with the same specs so that I could see just how impressive the internals are of this device crammed into such a slim shell. It is responsive and snappy and the tile mode is SO BEAUTIFUL and easy.I got the version XE700T1C-A02US version which is supposed to be 32 bit  - but it ended up being 64bit -  nobody seems to know what is what with these models. The store clerk informed me there was no keyboard with this model  -  well when I opened it much to my surprise there WAS A keyboard included! I think Samsung has some clarification to do on their models!So the keyboard was my one point of disappointment - I couldn't snap it on when I tried and then I realized that there was two little plus in the holes -  I felt like an idiot and was glad I didn't rush back to the store to complain I had gotten a faulty item (Though I am not sure the microsoft  store people even know enough about this product to know these plugs exist and might have thought there was a problem with the item as well) I didn't like the keyboard because for some reason it feels cheap to me. It's so light compared to the tablet it seems really unnatural and when its up and running it looks like I am working on a computer with the keyboard side up. I bet the 500t looks way sexier with its keyboard attached. I do think its an extremely practical design (I like it way better than the surface snap on covers with the stand in the back of the tablet, and way better than the series 7 keyboard solution with its individual dock and keyboard. My biggest gripe is it does not allow you to tilt it back far enough so when you use it on your lap its a bit to forward to be comfortable. I think maybe one more generation of keyboard docks and Samsung will get it right. However, I have to say the keyboard is cool and practical and makes the tablet a complete laptop replacement for users who need to do allot of typing. The track-pad is pretty slippery I really dislike it, but I overall I love that this thing can be used with a keyboard so nicely.Battery, I have not used it long enough to clearly asses the Battery. On the series 7 I got horrible battery life I think I see some improvement on the Ativ. I think the solution here is to just get a portable battery pack. I loved the 500t's longevity but I would rather sacrifice battery life for improved performance in my favorite programs.Overall I think this tablet is great! I think if you don't use intensive programs but you want the wacom digitizer for writing go with the 500t. I think if you only plan on having ONE tablet go with the 500t (I can't imagine doing my daily new york times reading on the couch with the honker of a tablet in my hand) Honestly, If it is for surfing, email, kindle etc... I would still go ipad... but if you want productivity this is the only tablet to go with!I hope I have helped some people out with my story and I am always happy to answer any questions I can! I will also try to post some updates as I use the Ativ 700T more.Update* I'm changing my rating down to four stars it is a great tablet but I have had some problems with force quit and crashes while doing corel with multiple layers also noticed some lag. I also HATE THE KEYBOARD and believe it has some unforgivable flaws. Overall this is still a good tablet especially if money isn't and issue. It is amazing to run programs in something this compact. I am returning mine, mostly because I think that tablets coming out in 2013 with Haswell will suit my needs better.", "The Awesome: I can run Photoshop CS6 for illustration purposes and the Core i5 processor allows me to paint in Photoshop like it's a portable Cintiq.  For $1200, that's pretty awesome.  Remember, you're buying a full-fledged, though smaller screened (11&#34;), computer.The Good: The processing speed, boot-up speed, and overall product performance is great.  The interface is snappy, the touch-screen is super-responsive, and the rest of the build is pretty great too.  I know some people are harping on the keyboard and plastic components, but really, it's pretty high-quality for all of the computing power that you're getting.  Also, the true 1080p resolution is sharp.The Bad: Man, this thing is deceptively heavy.  It's not quite Macbook 13&#34; heavy, but pick it up and you'll realize that you're buying a full-fledged computer here.  When you disconnect the keyboard, the weight is similar to iPad 1 which isn't too bad, but its noticeably heavier than it's little brother, the Samsung ATIV Smart PC.  The fans tend to run consistently, but are actually pretty quiet.  I was sketching in bed the other day and didn't wake up anyone... so that's a bonus.  The screen resolution, though super-sharp, can make text, buttons, and the overall &#34;classic desktop&#34; experience pretty small.  I noticed some eyestrain after looking at that for a while.  And last but not least, the track-pad sometimes doesn't respond for a second or two.  Very frustrating.", "Great tablet, Windows 8 really shines on this kind of computer. I do not have the keyboard disconnection issue that early adopters reported.My biggest issues is the 4GB RAM (soldered on) is quite limited for a computer of this caliber and price. Should have at least 8GB RAM.The keyboard dock doesn't contain a battery which makes it lighter than the tablet. This forced Samsung to restrict the maximum angle the screen can open when dock much more than a normal laptop. Also tends to tip backwards if not on a flat surface.The 128GB drive can be easily replaced with a different mSATA drive. I put a 256GB Crucial M4 in and it works flawlessly. Samsung's &#34;Backup&#34; utility which can be downloaded from the &#34;SW Update&#34; preinstalled utility allows you to clone the drive to the new drive for free and with zero hassles. Just plug the new drive in some way to the PC. I used an mSATA to full sized SATA adapter connected to a USB 3.0 to SATA adapter.To gain an extra 10GB of capacity on the drive, remove the recovery partitions. You can do this through either diskpart commnad line utility or if you want to keep the recovery partition, just buy a cheap 8GB USB flash drive. Use the &#34;Create a recovery drive&#34; utility included in windows (search the settings for this utility). Tell it to copy the recovery partition to the recovery drive. After doing that it gives you the option to remove the recovery partition from the computer, freeing 10GB of storage.", "This machine works and there are some things to like but I don't love it. I definitely didn't have the same reaction I had the first time I owned an sleak Ultrabook awhile back. This computer is really ugly and really heavy. It is significantly heavier than my Macbook Air which is a bigger 13 inch laptop. My annoyances started with the unpacking process where they don't explain the little plugs that have to be removed in order to attach the base. It's not as obvious as they assumed it would be. The lack of instant-on is my biggest disappointment or it is possible that I haven't configured it correctly. It only acts like it can do instant on for perhaps one day. Then it goes into a deeper sleep where I have to push and hold some buttons to wake it up. Even during the wakeup process, it spins through some display messages before waking up. For example, it will detect low ambient light and ask me if I really want to wake up just in case this is a backpack pressing the power button by accident. If it is legitimate, I have to press the volume up keys. This takes real work and slows down my productivity. The wakeup process itself also spins through some other things like a quick bootup. My Macbook Air can wakeup instantly by lifting the lid even weeks after I last touched it. The size makes it so that even if you upgrade to 2013 software, most screen elements are so small that you can't hit them accurately with your finger. The attached stylus can save you from that hassle which is one advantage of this device over other Win8 touchscreens of the same size. The stylus is also a great mouse for Photoshop and note taking. If more Metro applications ever get written, I can see this as being a great device. It is good enough to be a keeper but I won't be recommending it to any friends.", "Most other reviews cover the keyboard issues and all are true.  The weight is added without battery that could have been used as weight.  Stupid design move.  Tablet has had many bugs and many updates that have been addressing some of them, little by little. I would give the keyboard 2 stars and the tablet 4 due to the bugs.  The track pad on the keyboard is very poor.  I can understand Samsung not wanting to put much into that due to being a tablet.  I would like to know where the options are that were described when I bought it.  I will have to return and get a tablet that does not have so many unaddressed issues.  Compared to what the Surface should be, the Samsung tablet is 2nd rate.", "UPDATE:I've made the hard decision to return this item.  I use my laptop 70% of the time, tablet functions 30%.  I can't justify the cost on a product half baked.  Between some win 8 bugs and the issues already documented below, I've opted to update to a ultrabook laptop.  HP Elitebook Folio 9470m which you can read my review here: http://www.amazon.com/HP-EliteBook-Folio-180GB-Notebook/dp/B009PHUR66/ref=cm_aya_orig_subjIn 6 months, there will be better devices, hopefully one that addresses the shortcomings of this device.  By then Win 8 patches should be in place and more sites will address IE 10 compatabilities.  Even Amazon's site struggles with IE 10.Hopefully the Elitebook Folio will have a touchscreen and stylus option with a tablet option by then.I find that I need to work via laptop 6-10 hrs a day and then I want to relax and use the tablet functions, but with battery limitations with this device, you don't have this option.  So when I actually want to use the tablet, the battery is already drained from the day use, unless I was plugging it in everytime I returned to my desk which sometimes is not an option.So for now, I'll continue to use a laptop and switch to a tablet as needed.  As a tablet, this product is awesome.  The question you have to ask is, $1,200 awesome?  For me, not right now.UPDATE:You can read my updates below, but I put this on the very top.  I have to echo the review by Isaac related to the keyboard.  I've mentioned the issues below, but the price for just the tablet doesn't justify not having a functioning keyboard.  The top heaviness and the lack of being able tilt the tablet further back and that it's just a basic keyboard without much more to add to the tablet functioning, I've dropped my original 4 star rating to 3 as this combo just fails as a combo.  As a tablet, wins hands down, but I didn't spend this much money for just a tablet.  Samsung sells the keyboard alone for $130 which is ridiculous since it has little to offer that another external keyboard couldn't offer. I'm hoping Asus comes out with a pen input device as they already nailed the keyboard design with the SD card, extra battery.  The only missing item would be extra storage option.For those looking at tablets with pen options, here's a link that compares the tablets: [...]Previous Review:Fortunate to have a Microsoft store near me and they had just received a shipment, hadn't even had time to put it on display.They do not charge a restocking fee and they are in their holiday timeline, so I have until Jan 14 to decide whether to keep or return.  Just to make sure, I had them write this on my receipt.Ok, not that any of the above really helps in the review, but in the event you have one of these Microsoft stores nearby, it may be an option, especially since Amazon seems to still be sold out.I have an asus transformer 1st gen, kindle fire, ipad 1 & 2, I use a Toshiba R835 Ultrabook for most of my day to day computer work.I'm looking for something that can replace essentially the need to carry a tablet and a laptop and can handle windows software for business.I will update this review as needed.  I'm not going to repeat the typical reviews on specs, etc.  There's plenty out there, this will be on a more simplified level, from an end user perspective.INITIAL FIRST IMPRESSIONS:Tablet is big.  As a computer it's almost too small, but it's a compromise.  Weight as a tablet felt heavy, but not as heavy as my first gen asus transformer, but I'm use to carrying the ipad 2, weight as a laptop feels fine.  Nice and compact, although a bit on the thick side, but a nice smooth profile.Cons: No backlit keyboard, touch pad is narrow, no full size SD card, no VGA port (I hate carrying dongles and adapters).  Wish the keyboard had an extra battery and storage, ie. another hard drive, this would help weight down the keyboard.  The keyboard base is light, making it top heavy.  Wish they used USB 3 ports in the keyboard base instead of USB 2.  And it would of been nice if the ports were together so you could use an external DVD drive (which requires 2 usb ports typically).There's a large learning curve, mainly due to the new OS.  What doesn't help is, no manual.  It comes with a vague quick start guide.  I'm still trying to figure out how to turn the blue tooth on and NFR.  I'm sure there's a pdf, just have to find it.I did load a 64 GB micro sd card and the system recognized it without problems.  The power adapter is nice and compact, about half the bulk as my Toshiba R835 which was light to begin with.Even though it comes with a 128 GB hard drive, you actually have 78 GB of 101 GB available, so space will be tight.Before you dock the tablet to the keyboard, you have to remove 2 plastic tabs which I ended up having to use a knife to pry them up and out they were very tight fitting.Also they don't plaster stupid stickers all over the device (Except for 2 on the back side of the tablet.  No bloatware which is something Microsoft stores pride themselves on.Anyway, I know this is not much to go on, but I'll update this the more I start using it in real world work, once I load my programs and get use to the navigation.  Hope this helps.ADDITIONAL UPDATES:Took about an hour for the battery to charge to 100%.  I've now been using it for almost 3 hours and the meter still says about 3 hours left.  The screen resolution is fantastic.I haven't really stressed this computer out yet.  Mainly just learning how to navigate windows 8.  I did come across setting up my blue tooth and I have it paired with my Samsung S3, no really I'm not a Samsung employee, but it's one of the few that offered a pen input solution along with the other added benefits.I did come across an option to have the fan run automatically, at reduced speed, or not at all.  It's default is off, so I changed it to auto.So far, the unit's remained cool, but again haven't stressed it with lots of videos or intensive applications.Viewing angles are definitely better than my Toshiba R835.  The stylus is short, about 2/3 size of a normal pen and it's very narrow.  It's housed in the tablet and it's a very snug fit.  I'm sure it'll loosen over tine, but if I had nails, they'd be breaking trying to get it out.Also one thing to note is the screen when docked with the keyboard doesn't tilt all the way back.  I'm finding myself wanting to tilt the screen back just a bit further, but that's just me.  Probably done this way to prevent the unit from falling over, referencing the top heavy design.More Updates:The Box I have says OB 4 GB Ram which to me means On Board RAM.  The hard Drive says 128 SSD 4mm, which I'm guessing means it's part of the mother board also, since most SSD footprint are the typical 7-9 mm in height.  I see no means of removing the back without damaging the plastic.  I wish I could upgrade the storage and RAM.  Samsung really missed an opportunity not having extra storage in the keyboard, no backlit keyboard, no full SD card slot and no extra battery.  If they had done all of that, there would be very little reason not to like this completely.  It would also address the top heaviness.  If this had a battery on the bottom with twice the capacity of the tablet portion and it could charge the tablet, I would definitely take the added weight for that additional run time.As far as the camera appears to be 2 MP on the front and 5MP on the back based on running the camera app and they have a size selection and the back only went up to 5MP.The Samsung apps are found in the apps store.  Tap on the store tile, scroll to the Samsung picks.  All the aps are listed right there.  Somehow I totally missed these the first time because I checked there first since I figured it made sense.  Samsung must of added them between the first time I looked and after my factory restore.I'm not too impressed with the Samsung apps, they appear to be just the overgrown version of what you see with the Samsung S3 android apps.  I ended up downloading the free MS one note.BTW, I tried one notes, handwrote a bunch of stuff, lassoed it and was able to move the items with very little lag.  Yes, there was a slight one, but nothing that wasn't usable.I like that the device has a palm detection so when it senses the pen, you can rest your palm on the screen.  That may be more the software, but it's worked with one note and S note.I'm really not liking this keyboard, feels cramped and trying to hold the unit by the keyboard is not comfortable as all the weight is on the top so it places a strain on your wrist when carrying or holding.  You'll probably find yourself holding the top which to me seems awkward as I don't do this with a laptop.I'm having work load Windows 8 Enterprise as my work requires the Pro edition of Windows 8.  That's more related to my work, not the device, but once they do this, they'll load the MS office and I can start loading additional software.  So far, I've been using it more for typical tablet use, which I definitely am enjoying.  I'm seriously thinking of just getting a Bluetooth keyboard.Also this device is abnormally long in length, making it long and narrow (bigger than a pad of notebook paper, yet narrower than a typical pad).  Which means at meetings, it looks a bit odd.  I have to look for a business folio that I can place this in, unfortunately I don't think many folios will be accommodate something this tall.  I'll let you know if I find one.  I would of preferred one that was the same size as a pad of paper.  Could of used the height to even the look and that would of given the touch pad some added room too in the height department.Also, Samsung has included a Samsung utility called quick starter that includes the start menu, so if you get really stuck, this will help.Of course if you've made it this far in this review, I'm impressed as I know this is getting long, but hopefully this is helping.As soon as I get Win 8 Pro loaded and MS Office loaded, I'll really be able to provide run time in real world usage.  So far just browsing and basic tasks, the fan doesn't kick on and I'm getting roughly 6-6.5 hours.  I did watch about 45 minutes of you tube videos, which the fan did kick in and the top felt slightly warm, but nothing like my laptop.  It was barely noticeable to the touch and I had to hold my ear to the vent to even detect the fan was running.*** I just loaded a few pics ***Update: The 3G/4G slot next to the micro SD card slot is an empty shell.  I'm guessing there's no antenna as there is definitely not a card slot, if you try to place your sim card, it will just fall into an empty space and good luck trying to retrieve it.  Explains why the slot isn't marked.  Little disappointed as I took optional as if I went to a cell carrier and asked for a sim card and an account, I'd just be able to put the sim card in and I'm good to go.  A bit misleading.  For me, it's not that big of a deal as my cell phone on 4 LTE has the capacity to be a hot spot for no extra charge.Also, the hinge for the keyboard appears to be loosening up a bit too much in which the tablet will move by itself once it passes a certain point.  I'm thinking that I'd prefer a backlit Bluetooth keyboard built into a portfolio tablet case.  At least I have until Jan to see what else comes out.  Perhaps Samsung will create another optional keyboard base with all the missing features that were mentioned above.  Ok, one can be wishful.Other issue noted is attempting to upgrade to Windows Pro and having difficulty having the tablet boot via a usb.  Changed the bios boot order, but so far it's not booting from the USB device with the wind 8 Pro install files.
