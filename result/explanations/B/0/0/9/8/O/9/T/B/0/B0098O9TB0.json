It will literally change the way I do business, improving profit and making life much easier.  It's my first foray into the Win8 OS and I was excited to run the full program.There's lots of positive elements:1. The OS is pretty easy to adjust to if you're already used to touch technology.2. The onboard Spen and Snote software are great additions - an oversight on Apple's part to assume no one wants to write anything anymore.3. The weight is great and the larger screen size enjoyable to have available - an adjustment - but nice to have.4. One button screen rotation lock, USB doc, MicroHDMI plug in, expandable to 128gb with microSD cards, Xbox glass with other great nativeHowever, here's why I returned the device and will be pursuing other options.  Some research demonstrated these are relatively common problems so I wanted to highlight them briefly:1. Application freeze - right out of the box, the unit failed to perform well and froze with various applications.2. Display glitches - when loading Snote in particular, the device would show lines resembling a failing color TV - lots of colors, no clear image, scrambled appearance etc.3. Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) - within 24 hours of having opened the unit, one of the apps froze and then launched the BSOD.  I had to manually shut down the device to get it back up.  Less than 24 hours? Seriously? For a brand new device?4. S-pen not reacting - several times, the S pen just stopped responding and I had to shut down and restart the device to get the recognition back.5. Brightness - the thing constantly kept adjusting for brightness even when I sat in the same place for an extended period of time.  It would go light then dark then light again constantly - very distracting.Device Limitations - other reasons, not defects, I wasn't satisfied.1. Resolution - no Amazon app for windows means using IE and the lower resolution on this item was more disappointing than I thought it would be2. Processing Time - took longer than I expected to load apps, although the navigation worked well and didn't display much lag.3. System management - I felt like the various setting options weren't very well laid out.  Use was easy to adjust to, but I had a difficult time finding the settings I needed to adjust my preferences.Overall, I really really wanted to like it and keep it.  If it worked as expected (without glitches) I would have probably dealt the other issues and upgrade sometime next year.  As it is, I am returning it for the defects and probably looking for a Surface Pro even with the increase in cost.", "\"Samsung ATIV Smart PC 500T Review  -- A Love/Hate relationship trending towards acceptance.  ;)Overall, I find I really like this tablet, in spite of some glitches and issues. Read the reviews carefully.  If you can deal with the issues and get this tablet at a good price, I think you will be happy with it.Update: As of this date (June 18, 2013) the 500T is #31 on the top 100 best selling \"\"laptops\"\" list and has been in the Amazon top 100 sales ranks for 244 days running.  That surprised me quite a bit.  So it seems there are quite a few who like this rig!Summary:  Purely as a \"\"tablet\"\" experience, my Android tablets are far superior.  However, it runs Win 8 which is a huge plus if you need that capability and opens a lot of new doors.  So, it is a definite trade-off and one should consider carefully.  Given the price, a small Ultrabook is a reasonable alternative, in my opinion, when you have the keyboard attached.  However, without the keyboard, then a direct tablet vs. tablet comparison is the better \"\"apples to apples\"\" view.  So already you can see both the dichotomy and the attraction.  What is \"\"desktop mode\"\" without the trackpad (or mouse) and keyboard?  A mess!  So the dock is essential in desktop mode (for me, anyway).  And then, in tablet mode, one compares this to a good Android tablet and the Android wins (in my opinion) overall as a much better experience.  So what you are paying for here is a device that can live in both worlds... sort of a \"\"jack of all trades and master of none\"\" situation.  The ultrabook wins hands down for desktop uses and Android (or ipad) wins as a tablet...but the 500T wins when you need (or want) both in one slim, portable device.  And the 500T is not without it's charms (great screen, long battery life, etc.).So, as a device that can serve as a tablet one day, and then act like a mini-netbook-ultrabook (with keyboard dock) the next, well, there you have something - if you need it.  If you do, then the price may be justified and there are some nice features along with the many glitches.  If you accept the quest and vanquish the endless updates, you may find the treasure you seek.In the end, I am satisfied with it for the price I paid, but I almost sent it back.  Only by going through several days of updates (endless, slow updates!) and tweaks was I able to \"\"tame\"\" this to something I could live with.  I am definitely not sure the average consumer should subject themselves to that experience, so I would say this device is best for a gearhead geek like me rather than the average user.  Still I note in the reviews that several average users seem satisfied, so what do I know?  ;)Now that it has settled down, the wars are over, and it is behaving as it should, I am beginning to enjoy it more and more.  My favorite thing about this device is the very nice screen which makes watching videos a great experience (using headphones or external speakers).  Graphic images and photos look superb as well.  Also, it is a slim, trim and very portable device.  The final jewel that won me over was the excellent battery life.  Getting 10-14 hours of real life use on battery is absolutely wonderful and a real treat.  (If you actively manage power use, you can extend battery life even longer.  If you are lazy and never worry about it, you will still get 8-10 hours easily.)  That is a game changer for me and maybe you as well.Initially, during my first 2-3 days of ownership, I would have rated this 1 or 2 stars, maybe 3 tops.  But now that things have settled down, I would give it 3 at full price and 4 stars if you can get it at a good price.  Value matters.  If I pay more, I expect more.  So please keep that in mind. Thus my final, somewhat generous, rating is 4 stars, overall, and based on my personal experience, price paid (low), and needs.  (Screen quality, battery life, and the ability to run windows software are the big factors in the final rating.)Pros:Runs Windows 8 so you can run legacy and most recent Windows software.Very nice, slim profile for a large tablet.  Very portable.Boots up fast.Includes built-in digitizer and S-Pen interface (Pen stores on back of tablet.)No fan and no heat!Keyboard dock when it works (It will eventually settle down - hang in there!  See comments below.)Long battery life!!!Beautiful large display -- sweet!Cons:Runs Windows 8 -- not really \"\"tablet/desktop combined\"\" ready -- lots of glitches, Windows 8.1 on the way will fix some of these issues (hopefully!).Bluetooth is broken.  None of my Bluetooth devices tried so far will work properly.  Can pair, but not connect.  Have tried many things, but nothing works (so far). [Confirmed many others having same issue, broken BT software.  This is a big minus for me, might not be for others.]Keyboard dock when it doesn't work.  (See below.  Can be fixed with time and effort.)Limited (2) screen resolution choices available (affects games mostly).Glitchy operation.  For example, using headphones/external speakers sometimes it gets confused as to whether the internal speakers or external are \"\"active.\"\"  Easily fixed, but annoying.Here are my thoughts, notes and comments from my use so far:On sleep, turns off music.  Android tablets are smart enough to continue playing your tunes even when sleeping.  However, this is normal for Windows 8.Endless updates!!!  For the first several days be prepared for literally hours and hours of time updating your tablet.Flakiness in general - settles down some after updates, but still glitchy in many areas.Power button - position and short press on/off means *very* easy to accidentally turn on tablet when carrying it around. Would be better to have press and hold or slide like most tablets.  (Did they actually use test this thing?)  Volume control on side works well.Speakers not working when turned off with Audio out plugged in and then removed and restart system -- even after two restarts.  Had to plug speaker in, turn off, remove, and then it worked again - dumb!ETD.sys BSOD error - keyboard touch pad driver related, I believe.  (This was eventually resolved with further updates.)Keyboard working better finally but still an occasional disconnect/reconnect.  However, after many days and using the tip from another review here to put something behind the screen to push it forward, it mostly works fine now (even without anything behind it).  My experience seems to confirm other review comments that it eventually settles down with a little wear and use.Keyboard is fairly nice when it works.  USB ports are good, but a shame no audio/video ports on the dock.The S-Pen and built-in digitizer work well.  For some this will be a very big deal, not so much for others.  For me it is a very nice plus and a bonus over many similar tablet devices.  You can write and draw -- the most natural thing in the word to want to do on a tablet.  Nice!Windows 8 sucks as a Hybrid OS -- It should have kept the Desktop and Tablet modes more separate.  Tablet features interfere with desktop mode operation and make things harder.  Desktop mode is fairly useless without the keyboard dock or an external mouse and keyboard of some kind.  Maybe 8.1 will improve this.Beautiful screen, rich colors and good color saturation, good contrast, good viewing angles -- excellent for movies and video, photos, etc..  One of the best things about this device.Ability to run standard windows software is, of course, wonderful and the big draw here.Performance is OK, fine for most things.  Some lags here and there, programs slow to start, but operate fine.  Occasionally, something takes a bit longer than expected and you must be patient.  In normal operation it is responsive and fine.Internal storage is slow, the Samsung Micro-SD card (64 GB Class 10) I installed in the Micro-SD slot seems faster than the internal storage.  Hopefully, the internal storage is very reliable. Adding a Micro-SD card is absolutely essential.  Plan for it and include the cost.  It helps a great deal and you will need the additional storage as only about 39 GB is free on the internal.Android tablets a much, much better out of box experience.  (I'm just saying...)Some older games run fine, some not, hit or miss, just have to try, but being able to run some older, legacy games is a nice treat.  For example, \"\"Panzer General 3D\"\" loaded and runs, but slow between turns as it \"\"thinks\"\" -- animations and play is OK. Slow saves and other admin stuff. Playable if you're patient, but might get iffy with larger campaigns.  Have not tested that yet, just a quick scenario.  And due to the screen resolution limitations, it is a bit small, does not use the full screen.  On the other hand, \"\"Avadon - The Black Fortress\"\" runs fine, looks great, and uses most of the screen.  Planescape Torment also runs fine, but is small on screen like PG 3D as it uses a 640x480 portion of the screen only.  Looks good, though.As a tablet, it is sleek, has a great screen, works well for most things.  A bit big and awkward compared to smaller tablets, but you get that great video/movie screen! Overall it's not a big issue.  I got a small tablet stand for watching movies (without the keyboard dock attached) and it works great.  Can also watch holding/resting in lap.  No fan and no heat is a big plus.Battery life is fantastic - wonderful -- and a huge plus.  This was the thing that closed the deal for me.Speakers sound pretty good for a tablet, not very loud, though.  Ok for some things.  Need headphones or external speakers for music and videos in my opinion.Bluetooth is an ungodly mess.  Most of my devices would not work.  Would pair, but not connect.  Think it is installing wrong drivers (incorrectly identifying the devices) not sure.  Win 8 seems to have lots of Bluetooth issues.  Also very clumsy to add devices and use them -- far worse than Win 7.  How disappointing! Bluetooth should be easy to use, not the freaking nightmare it is here.  A quick Google search will show many are having issues and feel the same.  However, Win 8 BT on my Win 8 laptops works fine, so may be due to Samsung's choice of BT software.  Others are reporting similar issues.  Some rolled backed to earlier version of BT software and fixed it, others hoping for an update that will fix.  I gave up for the time being.  Will tackle it later when and if I have time.  But a real negative for me as I use BT speakers a lot.Tablet and keyboard look great and it has a very \"\"netbook\"\" feel in use, but with decent performance.  Perfectly fine from physical use point of view.  Web browsing and most apps run fine.  Performance is surprisingly good at times.The built-in digitizer and S-pen have a lot of potential that I have not even begun to explore yet.  Using the note apps, it works fine and is fun to use.  Later I will load some photo editing and graphics software and see what else is possible.  It's a substantial advantage over other comparable tablets if you need it and a nice plus even if you do not.Battery lasted 16-18 hours with intermittent use, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, sometimes idle.  Battery life is *not* an issue.  About 3% drain overnight which seems reasonable. I am getting 10-14 hours with constant use routinely.  With light use, I have gone days without recharging.USB flash drives w/kybd dock worked great - recognized and available very quickly.Win 8 Experience Ratings:Processor..... 3.4  (Acceptable.  Occasional lags on intensive programs.)Memory........ 4.6  (Fine.)Desktop Gfx... 3.7  (Acceptable.  Never notice any lag at desktop or start screen)Gaming Gfx.... 3.2  (Oops!  Not much for 3D Gaming...some old games will run OK, hit or miss)Primary HDD... 5.8  (Slow! You can see why programs load slowly, most 5400 HDD's are faster.)These scores are definitely in the \"\"netbook\"\" category, but for a tablet, they are actually fairly good.  The proper comparison here is to other tablets, not to laptops/notebooks (IMHO).  In use, things normally feel fine.  There are the occasional lags, especially with some system tasks, but most apps and programs run fine.  I had an Acer netbook and this is a much better experience.One could argue that buying an Ultrabook and an Android tablet would be a better way to go.  Depends on your needs and how many devices you want to lug around.  For many, the 500T (or similar) will be a very reasonable compromise.\"", "I went shopping for a new laptop after my last one self destructed its hard drive. The second computer to do that on me in the last five years. In all honesty I was planning to get the Samsung Chromebook but Best Buy was all out. So I visited the Staples next door. They had it, but they also had this computer. I didn't even know it was a tablet at first since it was set up like a laptop. Better it was at a very reduced price, $400 with the keyboard which was close enough to the Chromebook for me to consider it. And since I'm typing this review on it I obviously went with it.What sold me initally was I had 14 days to return it if I wasn't happy. It had a 64 Gig SD Hard drive compared to the 16 on the Chromebook. I was not familiar with Windows 8 at all and was completely confused by it initially. But I'd read up on it and the potential power of the OS which impressed me. At first I hated it and considered returning the tablet but kept at it. Now a month later I am very sold on it. While Windows 8 is a big change it is much more tablet app like than Windows 7 could be. I don't see it as ideal on a computer without touch screen but that isn't something I have to worry about with this computer.I've had no issues with drivers, lap, slow down, or programs. I mostly use my computer for media, writing and internet. Being compatible with the Office Suite wasn't something on my 'must have' list but it does make my life a bit easier. The S pen is very neat and I'm learning how useful it can be. I can take notes, draw on slides, etc much faster than I could using keyboard and mouse. The apps I've downloaded have worked flawlessly for me. I accepted that I needed a good antivirus with Windows 8 I wouldn't have needed with the Chrome OS, but the pros outweigh that con. I also travel a fair bit and this may be the lightest, easiest to carry 'laptop' I've ever owned.All that said I do no think this is an amazing tablet. Compared to the Ipad and Nexus I have I find it somewhat heavy and a little oversized. But as a hybrid that can serve as both a tablet and laptop for me I think its fantastic. For the price they can currently be found at I think its hard to beat and well worth a look, even as a laptop replacement if you don't need tons of onboard storage.", "After reading the reviews of the ATOM chip and having a netbook in the past, I had little hope for this tablet.  Windows 8 is a great OS for touchscreens but ATOM hasn't been good for me until now.This is a nice large widescreen tablet.  It has a full USB port (no USB dongle like with the ASUS tablet I used to own), plus it has a micro USB slot, micro HDMI, SIM card.....But in terms of performance, I can play Ilo Milo and Pacman DX from Windows 8.... no problems with performance.  Running other apps is acceptable although it's not as fast as my i7 notebook for work, but I didn't expect it to be.For a device that was supposed to supplement my great Timeline 1830T by Acer, this device is really very nice.  Running 8.1 on it lets me do the snap feature and running HD videos runs great on this.My HD podcasts play back great from within the Zune application I use and even better using Daum PotPlayer when using Overlay mode.For best results I've found the following are useful:1)Turn off Windows Defender.  It just slows down the machine.  Turning it off is like night and day.2)Use Daum PotPlayer and select Video Renderer as Overlay.  Video shows up well and full screen HD playback of H264 Hi-profile runs flawlessly and no major slowdown.3)Audio playback over bluetooth is very nice..... using the headphone jack is just as nice.4)I put TV Mobili on this to stream video over DLNA.  it transcodes the video within seconds and playback runs smoothly on my Bluray player.....  amazing and surprising honestly.  That's a great software to get if you get this tablet.Cons:The keyboard dock is OK, but I bought a great case for this on Amazon and I can't use the dock with it.  To replace that, I bought the Logitech K400r which has a full keyboard and touchpad built in for the modem.  Plug the little dongle in the USB port at the top and you have a full keyboard and mouse that is conveient to bring with you.It's big.  :)  Very big.... but I like big even though I know some of you out there may not.  Video playback is excellent with this so it does what I need.  I have no problems with replacing my notebook with this device.  The 4G LTE modem inside the device adds to what is already a great tablet.Despite the reviews, I think I got an excellent deal.  I bought it for $550 and I've hooked external USB harddrives up to it (no problems).  A bluray drive over USB plugged into it.... no problems.... (haven't played a bluray on it yet, but that's next).  I know that if I ripped the bluray to H264 or used Vudu, I wouldn't think that there'd be an issue.......So the verdict?  Buy it.  If you want a Windows 8 tablet, don't buy RT.  Buy this.  You can run all of your normal apps and if you keep it in perspective as to what you can run on it, you'll have a great time.", "\"I have been looking forward to making this my go-to device for around the house, at the pool, and travel. Although I really want to whole heartedly love this device, after four days of use, several issues make it unusable. The tablet has required a reboot many, many, many times (more than 20 in four days). I have installed all of the windows updates and all of the Samsung specific updates through the included Samsung SW Update software.The problems listed below puzzle me. It is impossible to determine if I am experiencing hardware failures or device driver inadequacies. I am returning the unit as defective and reordering another unit. I am very impressed with the build, size, and design. Hopefully I received a defective dock/tablet and the replacement will work without issue. I really want to keep this machine.I will update my review after using the replacement unit.

I kept testing the limits and always came back pleasantly surprised!PROCESSING SPEED:This is \"\"The Little Tablet That Could\"\".  I know some people were worried about how much horsepower the next-gen Atom chip would provide, and I'm happy to say that I'm extremely, extremely impressed.  Here's what I've thrown at it:- Photoshop CS6, medium sized documents (16x24\"\" 150DPI), medium sized brushes (400px max)- Illustrator CS6- InDesign- Video Watching (Netflix, etc.)Though there's a little lag in Photoshop... it's extremely useable as a rough-sketch tablet.  It's a poor-man's portable cintiq.  I've completed a couple full-color cartoon illustrations on it recently with no issues and similar results to if I were sketching on my powerhouse computer.BUILD QUALITY:Ok, it's plastic.  Get over it.  This thing is light (feels lighter than iPad), thin , has no fans, doesn't get hot, and is comfortable to hold.  I can't stress how impressive this thin tablet is.  You are buying a COMPLETE COMPUTER.  This isn't a tablet-toy... this will run full desktop applications.  The screen quality is also superb, and the resolution is actually perfect for this size of device.  The higher resolution offering (Smart PC PRO) with true 1080p causes eyestrain on an 11\"\" device.BATTERY LIFE:- 10 hours.  No matter what I'm doing... Photoshop, surfing the web, a little video watching...10 hours average.  Amazing!EXTRA STUFF:- Full-sized USB port (I plugged in a game controller and had myself a portable retro gaming machine)- Mini-HDMI out... I ran an external monitor (my television) with this thing!- Stylus: I already mentioned I sketch.  The little stylus is surprisingly capable for drawing, and the stock nib has a slightly softer tip, eliminating any clacking while taking notes in meetingsCONS:- Mostly with the software.  Windows 8 has some early build issues that have been resolved with updates, but freezing has happened, apps quitting has happened.  They're pretty infrequent after about a month of Windows updates.\"", "I bought this tablet with the keyboard, so I could avoid difficulties in obtaining one later. Though the tablet seems to be great, the keyboard was unusable from get-go. It could not be attached to the tablet. It should be a simple slide-in, but something is wrong with the keyboard, preventing this. I even called support, and that gal could not talk me through putting them together. She suggested I send it in for SERVICE: just hours after I opened the package. So back to Amazon this goes. Hoping the next one actually works.", "First I ordered the pen was not working properly.
