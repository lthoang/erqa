"], "reviews": ["The JavaJig provides a workable solution for people who like the convenience of cup-at-a-time brewing but who don't like creating a lot of waste.  It also lets you use your own favorite ground coffees with a Keurig brewer.Unfortunately, the coffee isn't quite as good as it is from an automatic drip machine.  The grounds simply aren't in contact with the water long enough.  So, while you can use your own coffee with this, don't waste your fancy Jamacian Blue Mountain or Hawaiian Kona in the JavaJig.  It produces acceptable results with mass manufactured coffees like Maxwell House.Clean up isn't bad as the grounds go out with the small disposable filter.  Filters aren't incredibly expensive, especially when you compare them with the cost of K-Cups.In all, it's a serviceable solution for people who want the convenience of a single cup brewing system and the flexibility to use whatever coffee is hanging around the pantry/freezer.", "Look, you have k-cups that cost a fortune and that aren't all that good (IMHO).  Nothing like using your favorite bean that you grind yourself and then put in a K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter that comes with most brewers powered by Keurig. Cuisinart has one that I use.  It has a metal filter/plastic basket and secures in place freshly ground coffee.  No grounds get into my coffee cup.  Works great if you grind your coffee to a moderately fine grind.  So with the Melitta Javajig you have a traditional paper filter instead of a metal mesh one.  However the means to secure the filter is not as secure as the K-Cup Resuable Coffee Filter.  So you have to buy paper filters at a premium to make a cup of coffee, where my K-Cup Reusable Coffee Filter is permanent with no additional purchases required and washes up great (particularly with an ultrasonic cleaner once a month).  So I'm not going this way for my morning java.  Sorry.", "I own a Mr. Coffee K-cup coffee machine and the JavaJig Reusable Coffee Filter system works perfectly in my machine. Assembling and disassembling is easy. The filters work well. One drawback is having to replace the filters but that's much less expensive than buying K-cups all the time. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to brew their own brand of loose coffee or tea.", "What I liked about this item:1. it was easy to use2. I can use my own coffee in my keurig vs. the expensive kcups3. easy to cleanWhat I didn't like:1. paper filters--you can't reuse them, and therefore you will spend lots of money on them2. when filled with the amount of coffee I would normally make, they spilled over and I had grounds in my cupIf you only drink a cup or two a day, this might be a good choice, as the filters are easy to put in and take out.  With two in the pack, you wouldn't even need to really mess with hot coffee grounds at all.  But, if you drink more than a cup a day, you should really look elsewhere.  The price of the filters will add up, vs. buying the keurig filter that is washable/reusable.", "I love my Keurig and was thrilled to try the Javajig as some of my favorite coffee doesn't come in Kcups. Plus I was even more thrilled when I found out that I can use my own coffee and save some money instead of buying Kcups all the time.To put the Javajig together is really simple: You just put the coffee filter over the black prongs, slip the green cover cover it, fill it with coffee, and put the cap on top. When I compare the ease of use between this and the Kcups the Javajib it is messier as there is an open hole on the top and your coffee grounds can spill out and you do have to wash it out completely when you are done. But my coffee tasted great and other than taking an extra 2 minutes: 1 min to setup and another 1 min to cleanup I have to say how happy I am with it.What I also enjoyed was the fact that it came with two filters which is perfect for my home. Hubby pre-makes his filter with his special blend & I pre-make my blend the night this was we each have our own blends for our morning.", "I don't like those Keurig instant coffees that you find in too many office lounges.  In fact, I hate the taste more than Starbucks'.***  ***When I saw the design of this, I immediately saw a way to use those Keurig sytems without having to deal with their coffee but I also wondered about using this even if there were none of the Keurig-style coffee makers available-- and there is.***  ***The set is a two 3-piece plastic sets which includes the green holder, a frame that holds the filter and a cover in addition to 30 mini-size coffee filters.Typically, you put place the frame top down, place the the filter on the bottom and encase both with the green holder.  You can, instead, place a filter inside of the green holder, put in a filter and sit the green holder inside of the frame.  The frame has two protruding tabs that can act as a handle.  From there you can pour in your coffee.Holding the handles on the frame, steadily pour hot water into this revised system.  It's a bit of a hassle to wait until it's finished filtering but the upside is, is that you're not dependent upon a regular coffee pot.  This is definitely a portable way to have the cup of coffee that you want and the 3-piece set is very small and easy to carry around.I like the option of knowing I can have coffee anywhere and anytime.", "\"We have a Keurig in our house, and my husband uses it everyday. Add in the odd cup of cocoa, tea, or cider and we were using about a box of K-cups a week. That does not sit well with the budget or with the piles of plastic K-cups in the garbage.First, we tried the \"\"My K-Cup\"\" from Keurig, and that one was just no good. Perhaps ours was faulty, but it leaked and was annoying to have to pull out part of the Keurig to use it. That led to the further search:Second, we went to an Ekobrew. It's nice, but it can be a pill to clean. This does not seem to bother my husband, who just lets the coffee dry in it, knocks out the grounds, and refills. That seems like a bad idea.Third, we are trying the Javajig. Here are its pros and cons:1. Pro: simple replacement for a K-cup rather than pulling the receptacle out of the Keurig. That's a positive.2. Con: the plastic is very thin on the outer casing. This does not bode well for long-term durability. Also, the thinness means that you have no effective insulation when removing the Javajig, it's going to be hot.3. Pro: Cleanup: while being careful not to burn your fingers, you can easily dump the grounds and paper filter into the trash. That's easier than washing out the Ekobrew4. Con: replaceable filters. One more item to purchase, have to keep on hand, and that the whole thing does not work without. While they are not pricey, it's still a hassle.5. Pro: Use your own coffee. That much is self-evident from the description. It's still the biggest pro: you can still use bulk coffee, bagged coffee, you can adjust your strength of coffee and more fully customize your Keurig usage.This is a useful addition to your Keurig machine.\"", "\"I have alwlays savored a good cup of coffee. Prior to getting my Keurig, I would hunt down beans, grind them and brew them. But the Keurig can't be beat for convenience. The only downside is the ridiculously expensive K-cups. I do get mine from online sites such as 11th street coffee and occasionally at Bed Bath and Beyond when i have thier ubiquitous 20% off coupon.  A do it yourself K-cup seemed like a great idea. Unfortunately, this one did not work as well as expected.I did like that there are two cups. I was planning to reserve one for coffee and one for tea. Set up is easy and well illustrated on the box.  In explicably,the recommendation that you use an expresso grind is embossed on the black cap. It is hard to read and really,  couldn't this info been put on the box? Essentially you slide one of the disposable paper filters over the the black filter insert and then slip the green up over the paper filter.  You fill the cup with your tea or coffee and put the cap on. (Again, there is no guage of how much coffee to add.again, a suggestion on the box would have been appreciated.) Although the directions say to \"\"snap\"\" it on, it does not snap. It just lies on top. After brewing, you toss the paper filter and rinse the cup, insert and cap. Unfortunately, my machine, which is an older model, punched a hole through the filter resulting in a grounds filled, weak cup of coffee. (Again, while the box says it can be used with most Keurigs, it would have been helpful to include a list.)  I tried again, using two paper filters and less coffee.That resulted in fewer grounds in the coffee, but the brew itself was watery and weak. I see that some reviewers more determined than I performed surgery on the legs of the insert. Frankly, I have neither the inclination nor the energy to go that far. For something that was supposed to make my life easier, it has not. I hadn't bargained on fooling with filters and snipping the insert all for a less than satisfactory cup of joe.While I applaud the concept and think the name is cute, the actual execution leaves alot to be desired.\"", "\"I ordered Melita's JavaJig system for use with my Keurig coffee maker.  The JavaJig comes with:2 green cups2 filter inserts2 lids30 disposable, one-time use coffee filtersUse is easy.  Place one of the filter inserts face down (prongs up) on the counter.  Put a filter face down over the filer insert.  Slide a cup down over it (wider side face down).  Pick it up, fill it with your favorite coffee grounds and snap the plastic lid on.Afterward, simply discard the filter and grounds and rinse the insert.  And therein lies the key to this product.  While the filter is disposable, you still need to rinse the black plastic insert and cup.  This is because the insert fits between the paper filter and the green cup, so the insert comes into contacts with the coffee grounds.So, to me I would just rather buy a Keurig \"\"My K-Cup\"\" which typically sells for under $15.  It includes a plastic cup and lid (both of which are thicker plastic compared to the JavaJig parts), along with a reusable mesh coffee filter.The \"\"My K-Cup\"\" eliminates the need for purchasing paper filters.  The Javajig includes 30 filters and sells at about $9, and refills sell for about $4 for 60.  You do get two reusable cups with the Javajig, so that is an advantage over the \"\"My K-Cup\"\" as those are sold one to a package.  You also do not need to remove the Keuring Pack Holder assembly to use the Melita cups, as you do the Keurig \"\"My K-Cup\"\", another slight pro for the Melita product.I don't notice any difference in coffee quality between the mesh filter and Melita's paper filters.  So, while this is a good product, unless you really find coffee from paper filters better than a mesh filter, I think it is not as good an option as the Keurig \"\"My K-Cup.\"\"\"", "\"I love thIs product. It has a simple design, is easy to clean, and makes a perfect cup of Keurig-style coffee. Plus it comes packaged with 2 reusable cups and 30 filters so you can make coffee for 2 or a large mug at one time easily.I have two other brands of reusable k-cups, and this one is superior by far. You don't have to pop out the k-cup holder every time you want to use it like you do with the official K-cup brand reusable cup. Also, the K-cup brand has a screw top instead of a simple click-on top like the Melita brand does. Grinds tend to get caught in the threads and the top gets stuck sometimes. Not with the Melita brand. Another brand I use has a flip top that works well and a built in metal mesh filter that can be tricky to clean if you don't do it immediately (hot grinds burn).If you follow the directions for the Melita, the filter fits perfectly. I love how easy it is to remove the filter and used grinds without a burning mess and then rinse the cup components clean. Do not over fill the cup or the extra grinds will come out the top of the lid during brewing and may end up in your cup.For those that complain that their coffee is weak, PLEASE read the product packge. It clearly states to use an espresso grind. Also consider this - the quality and freshness of your beans will determine the strength and character of your coffee. Many Keuring-style k-cup blends are weak in themselves, but there a few excelent ones out there. Expecting a vibrant brew from mass produced, lower quality product such as a Maxwell House or Folgers canned grind is ridiculous. The coffee beans, the roasting and grinding process, and the packaging used with such a lower grade canned coffee simply cannot compare to high quality, fresh ground beans. Currently I'm using the Melita Noir Blanc coffee fine grind, and the coffee is excellent and actually stronger than most k-cups I have found.My only complaint is with the filter itself, and this is more of a complaint with Amazon than Melita. The design benefits from using a disposable paper filter because it allows for easy disassembly of the parts and thorough cleaning. That said, it is useless without the filter. Currently, Amazon only ships the filters as an \"\"add-on\"\" item, which means you have to buy $25 of other merchandise plus these filters or they will not ship them. Prime membership makes no difference. So, you can either buy at least $25 worth of filters at one time (7 - 300 count packs @ $3.99 each is the current pricing minimum, that's 2100 filters at one time for 27.93 - what a commitment), or hope to coordinate a $25 purchase with the Fred purchase, hoping they are in stock at that time (which they are out of stock currently). So actually, I'm waiting for them to be back in stock before placing my dog food order - bummer. I haven't found this size filter locally yet, so I may have a great product that I can't use in the near future.Amazon, you are getting greedy. We've seen it in the discount reduction for subscribe and save items and now this \"\"add-on\"\" policy for certain items? Shame on you. You force customers to buy other items to receive the item you actually need now.\"", "At first it sounded like a good idea... a reusable K cup from Melitta. I have been a fan of Melitta years, from the single cup cone filter coffee maker to their cone shaped filters for drip coffee makers. This one sounded like a winner as well, because you had the advantages of a reusable K cup with minimal cleanup due to the disposable filter.The Javajig, however, is a rare miss. We have a Keurig Office Pro (B145) machine. While many reusable inserts don't work with this machine, this one worked perfectly without any modification. We didn't get any of the mess or other problems noted by other reviewers here. But it is a bit of a faff to put together and take apart. The biggest pain is the lid that snaps on the top. It has no lip or tabs so removing the top is a bit difficult especially if you have short finger nails and try to do it while the grounds are still hot. Additionally, the pronged insert (the one you put the filter over) does have two little tabs and it's easy to mistake them as tabs for removing the lid.The biggest problem, however, is that makes lousy coffee. Our coffee came out extremely weak. When we took the lid off we could see why. Instead of spraying water evenly over the top of the grounds the Keurig shoots a stream into the cup. This leaves a channel down the middle of the grounds, and doesn't sufficiently soak the surrounding grounds for for proper flavor extraction.Bottom line: good idea, bad execution. Not recommended.", "This is a good product, although no solution is as ideal as the K-Cup itself. The Melitta Javajig Reusable Coffee Filter System is just one of many recent attempts to find a way to use a Keurig coffee maker without feeling wasteful. I've used several Keurig machines over the last few years. I love them! I still have that little feeling of remorse over throwing away all those K-cups.The Javajig is easy to assemble, taking less than 30 seconds without paying much attention to the very helpful instructions (pictures) on the box. In about 3 motions, you plop this on there, that on top, put this in there and it's ready to go. The little filter is a good idea if you, like me, dislike coffee grounds in your cup of coffee. That's a good idea.The Javajig does not work with my Commercial Grade Gourmet Small-to Medium Office Brewer B155. That's the machine I'm using most right now, so it won't work for me. If it had fit my machine, I would have added it to my several K-Cup options.", "What's nice about this style of reusable k-cup is that they only need a quick rinse and it's easier to throw away the grounds when you have the mini filter holding them - less goes down the sink.In use, the lid snaps securely onto the cup and the filters stay in place well.  Getting it apart is a bit more tricky, but not too bad.The biggest downside is finding the filters.  I couldn't find them in my closest grocery store.", "\"I have used the JavaJig several times since receiving it, with a variety of teas.  My brother used one with his favorite coffee, and we both agree it's a dandy little doodad that can save you loads of money in place of K-Cups.There are three plastic pieces and a paper filter to the JavaJig.  You place the inner black piece with the four prongs on your counter, prongs pointed upwards.  Place a filter atop the prongs.  Take the green \"\"cup\"\" part and lower it onto the filter and prongs pushing down gently until the device snaps into place.  Then flip it over, put your own tea or coffee inside the \"\"cup\"\" and snap the lid onto the top.  Then put it in your Keurig, and brew away!There are visual instructions on the side of the box.  One thing the instructions don't tell you is how much tea or coffee to put into the JavaJig.  The first time I used it, I used too much loose tea, and my Keurig leaked a bit.  Since then, I have limited myself to about a teaspoon and a half of loose tea, and it has worked well.It comes apart easily for cleaning.  I hold it over the garbage can, pull the green part off, and dump the filter and loose tea in the trash.  Then I wash and dry it for next time.  Easy peasy!This set comes with an initial 30 filters and once they are gone, you'll need to buy more.  But even with that, you'll still come out ahead vis-a-vis the cost of k-cup.Happy Sipping!\"", "\"Like many others, I do not like sludge at the bottom of my coffee cup.  I thought that the Javajig would be the answer to my troubles.  Sadly, it isn't.The Javajig has 3 pieces + a single serve filter.  The green plastic outside piece is pretty flimsy.  You have to \"\"assemble\"\" the Javajig for each cup of coffee.  The snap on lid does snap on, but it takes some practice to get it right.  Clean up is messy because the grounds stick to the lid during the brewing process.I tried putting different levels of coffee grounds into the filter to try to find the optimum ground level & brew, but could never get the coffee strength that I like (medium-strong to strong).  After a few tries, I gave up & went by to My K Cup.Great idea, but the product design needs tweaking.\"", "I love my Keurig and I even have another brand of reusual cup but I found this one frustrating.  I could not make paper filter work that I didn't have grounds in my coffee. I like the other reusual cup that I don't have to continue to buy the paper filters.  I found that it was messy and the coffee did not taste great. This might have been operator error but won't be using this product anymore.", "the worst thing about a keurig is the cost of the cups.  There's always the convenience of a single cup, but, we still have a standard coffee maker for when we have company or a long morning socializing.  This product provides two reusable sleeve kits that make it simple to use a paper filter and ground coffee in your keurig.I've also used the metal mesh flip top cups, but I tend to prefer to use these paper filter reusable cups because they are much easier to clean and reuse.  my wife originally said.. why do we need more of those?  She's a fan of the Melitta reusable K-cups as well..  with her Pete's or Starbucks....", "I love this little Javajig! I've used it for coffee and have had great results. The only downside I've found for the coffee is assembling it before I am quite awake - the coffee was good but the K Cups are easier for first thing in the morning coffee. You could always set it up the night before. It worked fine for ground coffee and is a price saver for sure. The coffee should be very finely ground for the best results.What I have discovered that I absolutely love about the JavaJig is putting it in empty and filling my tea cup that has a removeable infuser. I put in the empty jig, put the tea inside the cup and make the tea. My tea cup has a lid that I use to steep the tea and then remove the infuser before drinking. This makes a perfect cup of tea that is super easy and delisious. Anyway, you can use the jig to just run hot water for tea bags or any type of tea. It doesn't work that great if you put the loose leaf tea (perhaps it would work better if the tea was finely ground) in the jig-it makes a weak cup of tea but if you have an infuser and can steep the brew as you normally would, it works very well. Nice little invention, this!I just noticed on QVC that the newer Keurig brewers are coming with their own version of this type of product to use with other coffees and tea. For the older models, like I have, this jig is the same as the My K Cup. The newer brewers are coming out with a hot water option, but using the empty java jig is the same. You can also use the hot water for instant soups and instant oatmeal.", "I've tried several K-cup replacements and have to say that this is my least favorite. While it offers the advantage of a filter material to ensure zero grounds make it into the cup, using it is far more cumbersome than other options.There are three pieces to the unit: an outer cup, and inner filter holder, and a lid. To set it up you put a filter on the inner holder then push the outer cup over it. Fill it with coffee and snap on the top.It worked fine in my Cusinart K-cup machine 9 out of 10 times. The 10th time the filter malfunctioned somehow, and the cup was filled with a lot of grounds. Not sure why that happened since the filter material was not damaged.But regardless of the malfunction (which I think was user error on my part), the coffee is not as robust as when I use non-filter replacement cups. The filter paper traps the oils which, for me, greatly diminishes the flavor. I'm willing to live with a little sediment in the bottom of the cup in exchange for a richer, deeper taste.Plus, there's the on-going cost and waste of the filters. I was able to make my own using some cheap 8 cup basket filter paper from a warehouse club. Just cut it into a 3 and 3/8 inch diameter circle, and you're good to go. (Note: the failure I describe above was not with a home-made filter, but with an original one from the box. No problems using the home made ones). That saves money, but is time consuming.The top cap also is fussy in that it sometimes does not click on securely.This was interesting to try, but I much prefer the Eco Brew (Ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count) or the My K cup (provided that it's used with the Medelco RK202 filter). This is just too much work, and the end result is not nearly as flavorful as it should be. Not recommended.", "I have mixed feelings about the Melitta Javajig Reusable Coffee Filter System. There are some good things about the system and there are some bad things as well.The good part... I think these filters are easy to use and work well. I haven't had any grinds in my coffee or any broken filters yet. They work very well and brew a perfectly fine cup of coffee. I have used the washable k-cup filters for years now and have liked using them but it is a pain washing out the filter. However the filter lasts for hundreds of uses with no additional cost other than the original purchase price. With these filters all you have to do it throw away the filter and quickly rinse off the plastic frame and lid. It works well and is pretty easy to use.The bad part... The cost of these filters is extremely high. For example I can buy a pack of 100 full size coffee filters at most any grocery store for about 2 dollars. These tiny little filters are about a tenth the size of a full size filter but they cost about 4 times as much.That being said I would really consider using this system all the time but only if the filters were substantially less to purchase.", "When I first got my Keurig, I bought a couple boxes of K-cups and realized that I could not enjoy coffee as much as I would have liked because of the price of the K-cups.I was really excited to see this Java-Jig. It's a reusable K-cup shaped cup with filters. Works really good. Just put the paper filter inside the cup and fill with any ground coffee, snap lid on and use just like any K-cup.I thought clean up would be a little easier but anytime you mess with coffee grounds, it's messy.My own little tip - the filters that comes with this seem to be the same as those mini muffin/cupcake liners. I have just been using those with the reusable cup since I run out of the ones that came with the Java-Jig.", "\"I like the Javajig system because it is easy to clean up and helps save some money compared to purchasing K-Cups.  However, the taste of the coffee compared to actual K-Cups varied.  I did not think the coffee was as strong, but if you like light coffee, you might not mind it.  I use a fine grind in these cups and clean up is a breeze.  The filters are not very cheap, and Amazon sells the filters as an \"\"add-On\"\" item.  It is definitely good to have during parties for guests who want coffee and you don't need to brew a large pot.  It's a neat little system, and a lot more economical compared to real K-Cups.  I recommend it.\"", "I like this over the other K-Cup adapters in that it has an actual filter and not just a mesh.  That means it does a better job of keeping particles out of your cup.  I'm told that a filter will also keep some undesireable oils out of the coffee.  Also makes it easy to clean.", "\"The Melitta Javajig Reusable Coffee Filter System says it's \"\"for use with most Keurig style single serve coffee brewers\"\". Unfortunately, my Hamilton Beach 49995 FlexBrew Single Serve Coffeemaker must not be among \"\"most\"\". The Melitta Javajig just does not fit the Hamilton Beach's K-Cup holder. Sorry my review can't be more useful, other than to say that if you're not using a genuine Keurig machine, or one that another reviewer can confirm works with the Javajig, you may not want to spend the money to find out it doesn't work.\"", "This is the great solution to using the Kuerig but not having to spend so much money on the cups.

I keep some regular coffee in the cupboard and use these little cups so I don't go into complete caffeine withdrawals!  Since you are using loose coffee, there are little coffee filters included with these.  Not as simple and easy as the store bought, pre-filled K-cups, but no big hassle, either.  The cups are reusable, which is a big plus.  I'm glad I have these for desperate coffee times.  I'd recommend.", "I got this to use with my Kuric coffee maker.  We grind our own beans to use with this reusable system.  The cost per use is about .05 cents compared to .37 -.55 cents for the k cups you buy online or at the store.Once you figure out the system and how to use it they are efficient and quick.  I found it easier to center and lay the paper across the green basket and push the black paper holder into it, then put on the black lid after you have put in the coffee.  One word of warning.  DO NOT fill the paper too full or you can clog up you Kurig machine.  Keep the coffee about 1/8 of an inch below the center hole.Overall I like the system as compared to other and would recommend.  The cost savings is worth it, even if it does take a little time and getting use to.", "After using the Melitta Javajig Reusable Coffee Filter, I prefer it over the Keurig K cup.Pros- easier to clean.  Just throw the filter in the trash.- no need to change the K cup holder in the machine.- two holder rather than the one in the reusable K cup.Con- not as &#34;green&#34; due to the disposable filters- you still need to tamp down the coffee to make a strong brew", "Of all the single serve units I have tried (all of them on the market) for my Keurig, this is by far the easiest to fill of them all. It comes with clear, easy to follow instructions and using my favorite coffee brewed a fine cup of coffee. I prefer my cup-a-joe on the strong side and drink it black. Unlike some of the other units I have tried, the Melitta Javajig single serve system's filters are so easy to insert and the capacity of the unit allows me to almost fit two coffee scoop of ground beans into the holder. I highly recommend this product. Melitta has been a coffee lover's favorite brand for decades and this system does not disappoint.", "The biggest thing about the Keurig is convenience. This is why we overpay for a pre-packaged, pre-ground coffee. We know we are overpaying, but the thing is so damn easy, it's often worth the money. It's nice though to be able to use the machine with coffee not offered via k-cups, and so a reusable system like the Melitta Javajig is a nice option. This four piece filter (including paper filters which you replace each time), is fairly easy to assemble and use. The plastic of the cups isn't very durable and all it would take is putting it in the Keurig incorrectly or dropped for it to get smashed. Once assembled it's easy as a k-cup to use and does a solid job with coffee. The problem is that it's not a one time purchase and you have to buy specialty coffee cup filters to replace these when you run out.Since we're talking more about connivence than almost anything, I like our EkoBrew filter better. It doesn't have the internal paper filter and it's much more durable and easier to clean. If that style of fill your own k-cup didn't exist, I'd probably happily use this one...", "Great idea, cost saving; this lets me use my own coffee when I want to make only one cup.
