Reminded me a lot of some of the abused/disfigured toys you see in one of the Toy Story movies (shudder).Anyhoo, the more important thing is how do the kids like it?For this, I turned to resident 4-year old doll and figurine expert, Sara, who says that she did not like it when it pooped/pee'd.I asked her what she would think about it if it didn't poop and pee?

Questions:
Our doll drinks the bottle without a problem but will not eat from the spoon. Could the replacement spoon we got be the wrong one?
Is the spoon a magnetic spoon? We lost II and bought the Orange spoon that came with the food. That one does not work?
Does this doll speak spinash too? I read that another Baby Alive doll change from english to spanish if you press and hold the bracelet. Thanks!
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
"Creepy ""look"" to this one!
Yikes.
The first time I saw this doll, it was laying on the floor on its back, and even from a distance, it looked ""off"", from the weird shape and size of the mouth, to the grotesquely large head.
Reminded me a lot of some of the abused/disfigured toys you see in one of the Toy Story movies (shudder).Anyhoo, the more important thing is how do the kids like it?For this, I turned to resident 4-year old doll and figurine expert, Sara, who says that she did not like it when it pooped/pee'd.I asked her what she would think about it if it didn't poop and pee?
""Well, I like my other dolls better because they have more things (clothes) I can put on them, and they are softer.""
(by softer she means more flexible so she can dress and undress them)Bottom line:  Based on her reaction and feedback, and the fact that I never see her playing with it, I have to give it a thumbs down.
Creepiness factor might just be me, so I am not knocking off any stars for that one.Other things to consider:1.
Doll does not really look much like a baby...more like a cross between a baby, a frog (because of that freakish mouth) and one of those toddler pageant kids with tons of makeup.
Our 4YO prefers the more baby-like ones, that are more flexible.2.
Feeding and changing the baby requires adult supervision, unless you don't mind a big mess; cleaning of the baby after feeding needs to be done by an adult, to ensure no food stays inside; that's one more chore for Mom or Dad.3.
The food & diaper refills are not very easy to find.
Local Target carries the dolls but has no refills on the shelves.
Wal-mart doesn't carry refills either.
Big fail, there, IMO.4.
Doll says many different phrases in a clear way, which is a plus (so many toys/dolls have terrible audio).Bottom line: I think there are better dolls out there, certainly considering the price.
The extra ""features"" of this particular model weren't at all interesting to my kids (and possibly a turn off), and even ignoring those features (which you are paying dearly for), the ""normal"" doll fun factor was not even there due to material, flexibility and look of the doll."
"This has to be at least the fifth Baby Alive doll in our house.
Not that the other four have broken or anything.
The six year old got one and loved it, so the four year old wanted one of course.
Then for some reason the four year old asked for a slightly different one the next year for Christmas, and the six year old then wanted another just like it.
We just opened up the box the other day, and our one year old went nuts over it too, so I assume we'll be buying more Baby Alive dolls in the near future.As a Dad, I have no idea why this is such a good toy, but the girls love it.
It fills up a diaper which seems kind of gross to me, but again the girls love it.
The doll seems to be able to wear clothes from other dolls we have, so that is another plus.
It is durable, gets hauled around all over the place including the bathtub, and plays a key role in endless games the girls play in the basement.
So, I'll consider it money well spent.With three girls, we've been through a crazy number of dolls.
Other than their American Girls Dolls, I would say these Baby Alive have been the ones most enjoyed.
The price is probably a little higher than some other dolls, but worth it.
Also, you may find yourself swearing quietly if you're forced to go purchase more ""baby diapers"" for your doll.
C'mon Dad, are you really going to tell your little girl you won't buy her baby some new diapers??"
My five-year-old daughter was amazingly excited when opening the box.
The doll is rather BIG!
Anyways, she played with it for a few days and she seemed to have forgotten about it.
She also has a baby doll that doesn't say anything and is less technical.
She seemed to prefer this new technically advanced one that talks for a few days.
After about a week, she was back to carrying her other boring doll around the house.
This doll is cute and nice if you want to give your child the experience of feeding and changing a baby.
But if you are looking for a low maintenance, low cost doll this is probably not the one for you.
Since the doll only comes with a couple of food packets and a couple of diapers, you have to buy more if you want to feed the doll more than a couple of times.If you have not seen this doll in person, I highly recommend going to a toy store and checking it out because it is a lot bigger than I expected.
"My daughter was very excited by this toy at first but she soon lost interest in it.
I think she was turned off by the fact that it is not really a ""carry around"" doll.
Being made out of hard plastic it just is not the doll that she wants to take with her when she goes in the car or plops down to watch some TV, etc.
It's plastic body just does not encourage cuddling.So, after the initial thrill was over, this toy more often than not ends up in the bottom of the doll basket and rarely gets any serious play time."
My two and a half year old son loves babies and is fascinated by dolls -always trying to snag one from a little girl.
So when I saw Baby Alive offered I chose it immediately.
Right out of the box my son was playing with Baby Alive.
He loves giving her her bottle and feeding her with the spoon.
She has worn most of his tshirts and shorts from the too small giveaway bag that we always have on the go, he really wanted to take the bow out of her hair but it does not seem to want to be removed.
He loves to change her diaper, after trying and realizing that they were too small for him to put on.
We did not explore the pablum consistency baby food--not interested in dealing with that mess.
Possibly farther down the line.Things that could be improved:The doll has a switch on her back to turn on so that she speaks, I wish that it had two settings one for Mommy and one for Daddy.
My son thinks that he is a really good daddy just like his dad.Also on her head in her soft hair there were sharp things all over.
I assumed that it was pieces of plastic, but it was actually glue used to attach the hair on the inside of the doll head that had seeped out the hair holes and dried on the synthetic hair making it feel sharp like pointy plastic.Overall a great toy.
Hours and hours of enjoyment in our home.
In reference to my review with the Makala Song Baby Alive doll--I have 2 daughters which are too old and too young for this toy so this was given to my 5-year old niece.
The Baby Alive My Baby Alive - Blonde is actually one of 3 other Baby Alive dolls that she owns.
The difference with this one is with the accessories and the fact that you have to go online for a particular feature.
This doll instills an impression for a young kid such as my niece to care and nurture a sibling which she has one.
The minute she received it, she was full of smiles and she wouldn't part with it.
Even stays beside her during bed time which is really so fun and touching to watch a little girl developing the art of caring.
I highly recommend this doll for its intended age range of 5 years and up.
I love the fact that it gives a positive impact on little girls.
My 4 year old immediately became obsessed with My Baby Alive as soon as she saw the box.
She, and her 2 year old sister, love babies and the size and weight of My Baby Alive please them much more than other baby dolls.
My daughter loves that Baby Alive say a variety of things and often calls her mommy.The doll comes with 2 diapers and 2 food packets.
Feeding is messy and my child is perfectly happy pretending to feed the doll when playing alone.
The food and diaper refills are expensive.
The diapers can be replaced by preemie and newborn diapers taped securely.I couldn't be more pleased with My Baby Alive.
My 2 year old has a habit of putting everything she finds in her mouth and this doll survived her gnawing without damage and no parts have broken off to become choking hazards.
The perfect doll for any little mommy or small child pressuring unwilling parents for a sibling.
I haven't been asked once for a baby since bringing this doll into the house and that alone is worth its weight in gold.
I gave this to my niece who loved it at first sight.
We ran out of her diapers the very next day (this is how much she played with it!).
After several months, my niece still plays with this doll.This doll could create a mess so if this is something that concerns you, I would advise against buying this.
Also, cleaning this toy can be difficult because there is no way to access the area through which the food travels from her mouth down to the diaper area.Overall, this is a great toy for kids.
"There are many ways a child can interact with Baby Alive which makes this a very entertaining toy.Most any child is bound to love the doll's delightful BIG eye's.Baby Alive says approx 25 phases, by pressing her bracelet.And approx 10 others which are activated only by her spoon or bottle.Those phases are particularly about her eating, changing her diaper, etc.If you loose the spoon and bottle, you loose those phases.As soon as she's fed she'll need her diaper changed.She ""pee's"" and ""poop's"", in other words -- the food and liquid go straight through her.This is a very messy process that is meant to be educational,but the clean-up will require adult supervision.Her hair is soft and curly and is not meant to be washed.If you get food in her hair you're to wipe it off with a dry cloth.Nor can she be submerged in water, that would ruin the voice box in her belly.When Baby Alive is laid down for a nap her eye's close,and automatically open when she sets up again.The doll comes dressed in a cute pink and green washable dress, and wearing a diaper.She has a matching bib and one spare diaper.She has a bottle, bowl and spoon, and 2 packets of food.This doll kit is meant for at least three years old and older.Two AA batteries and instructions are included.One drawback with this doll kit is that you're suppose to use only Baby Alive doll food.Hasbro's Baby Alive doll food and diapers super refill pack seems rather pricey at around twenty-four dollars.This is a high maintenance doll, that is perhaps better suited for a bit older child.After inspecting the doll from both ends, it's clear that there's simply a channel from the dolls mouth to her bottom.All thin liquids run straight through.In addition to Hasbro brand food and diaper's, we intend on improvising.This isn't rocket science, there shouldn't be any problems.If all the food is as thin as Hasbro's food,and your final rinse is completely clear to keep the doll sanitary.Hasbro instructions mention to not let their food set and get dried out or it may get stuck.They don't say how to get it un-stuck.Maybe lots of water to soften and or air blown through would do the trick?No matter how you choose to feed and cloth the doll,Baby Alive provides a wonderful pretend world of caring and conversations.Update; I phoned Hasbro Aug 24,2011 - they said you can get replacement spoons and bottles.They had approx 40,000, and then they'd no longer be available.Their phone # is on the box, spoon's cost 50 cent's each, and bottle's - $1.25 each.We received the spoons and bottles as stated above on Sept 9, 2011.Up-date; May 27, 2013, We no longer have the Baby Alive box, (so no ph#)I'm not sure if spoons/bottles are still available today.One may wish to contact Hasbro if that's a concern."
Let me preface this review with a warning - what you see pictured on the order page is not exactly what you get.
I thought I was getting a regular looking baby doll for my granddaughter and then it arrived.
The head on this doll is HUGE.
I mean HUGE.
I felt it was creepy - the head seems a lot bigger than the body.
However, the five year old granddaughter thinks it is very cute.
Beauty in the eye of the beholder, I guess.The doll, once you get past the freaky head size, has curly fake hair - not molded plastic like a lot of the Baby Alive series of dolls have.
The doll sits well in spite of the head size (go figure).
The eyes of the doll close when laid down and open when sitting up.
The cool part of the doll is the talking.You turn the doll on (after inserting two batteries) with a switch on the back.
Then the Mommy is required to press the button on the doll's wristband to activate the speech.
It has 30 phrases, but we haven't heard them all yet.
After sitting for awhile the doll is silent.If you are feeding the doll the supplied food or giving it the bottle, the doll will make noises like sucking and slurping.
The bottle and spoon that come with it must be necessary because the granddaughter couldn't get any of her other toy bottles and spoons to make the doll talk/suck.The food comes out as advertised and changing diapers is fun for her.
You have to follow the directions to clean the doll out, but since it's going to live here I will probably be the one to do that so it gets put away correctly after each use.
(I remember old eating/pooping dolls from 30 years ago growing mold when they weren't properly cared for and I plan to avoid that with this one.
I have brought several different types of Baby Alive dolls over the years.
I have to say this one is my favorite.The doll that came out before was kind of crazy looking.
This one has a soft face and does not scare kids when she talks.
( that's what happened to the other one)My daughter loves to feed the doll and change her diapers.
She calls it her little sister.
I buy the preemie diapers from the grocer instead of buying Baby Alives expensive diapers.
These preemie diapers fit very well.
and work a whole lot better.
At the end of the day when my daughter is finished with the doll I make sure she takes the potty (from the other baby alive doll)and gives her 2 bottles of water to clean her out.
You should do this every few days because your doll will smell bad.
Love the doll and great friend for a little girl.
TheBaby Alive My Baby Alive - Blondeis a realistic doll that does a lot of the things a real baby would do.
On the one hand that's the attraction: it 'eats', 'poops' and needs diaper changes.
On the other hand: it also smells bad if you don't clean it and you need to spend money for food and diapers.
It's pretty realistic, isn't it?
:-) Unlike a real baby it talks quite a bit!My daughter enjoyed playing with it but unfortunately lost interest after only a few days.
She prefers her simpler dolls that don't do anything except what you 'imagine' their doing.
So it's back to basics for us and in this case imagination trumps simulation.
My toddlers thought this doll was pretty awesome, and quickly took to feeding it and even noticing it wet its diaper.
We're hoping they take an interest in wet diapers, too, since we have a REAL baby they might be able to help us with!
;-)Wishful thinking aside, I thought this was a well constructed doll, but I have to wonder how long the feeding/changing will last.
You only get two disposable diapers with the doll and a few packs of play food.
I'm not sure we have the resources and interest to finance buying anything more for the doll after that small supply is used up, even if our kids wanted more.Nevertheless, it's a pretty cool toy.
This doll is the latest hit in our household, as my four-year-old daughter loves playing Mommy to her little brother.
Now she has her own baby to coddle and love and talk to.LIKES-She feels like the doll interacts with her, talking when she presses the button.-She loves getting to give water in bottles to her.-She likes feeding her the food and is meticulous about it.-We've found that several of her old newborn-sized nightgowns and onesies fit, so she likes dressing her.-The volume of the doll's voice is just right, she only talks when the button is intentionally pressed (unlike some of our other toys, which make noise if slightly tapped...or just randomly without any touching!
), and her voice isn't annoying.DISLIKES-I should have realized that we would need to buy more food.
That's my daughter's favorite part, and I know her well enough that I should have expected that.
I might try to figure out how to make our own, but I don't want to gamble too much on it and end up messing up the doll.
We'll see.-The diapers are AWFUL.
Granted, my daughter force-fed the doll because she was SO excited to feed her and give her water, but the first one was like a newborn human baby's diaper blowout - the more watery version of the peas was everywhere: on her clothes, on the diaper, on my daughter's clothes, in every crevice of the doll's area down there!
Thankfully, the poop (from the peas) didn't stain, but it was a mess.
When I looked at reviews for additional diapers, several people recommended buying and using newborn or preemie sized baby diapers instead because they're cheaper and they contain pee and poop better.
My sister-in-law had some newborn diapers left over from her three-month-old son, and those worked perfectly!
I would have skipped the Baby Alive diapers if I had realized that.
I'm planning to buy some itty bitty cloth diapers instead of going through disposable ones, but I haven't gotten around to that yet.-Also, she only talks/makes noises with the spoon and bottle that come with the doll, so don't lose them!
Hasn't been a problem, but we might not have been as careful with them if I hadn't realized this in advance.
This Baby Alive doll has an age recommendation of 3 and up.
However, my 17 month old daughter has been playing with it, and it absolutely delighted with it.
Instead of using the food provided, my daughter pretends to feed her with the empty bowl, spoon, and bottle.
Considering that I have a toddler in diapers, I am really not anxious to change the dirty diaper of a toy doll as well.
After she is older and capable of cleaning up the doll herself, we can introduce the play food and water in the bottle.She loves hearing the doll talk, and she is fascinated by the eyes that open and close.
This doll can keep her quietly occupied for at least 30 minutes at a time, which is no small accomplishment for a toddler of her age.
