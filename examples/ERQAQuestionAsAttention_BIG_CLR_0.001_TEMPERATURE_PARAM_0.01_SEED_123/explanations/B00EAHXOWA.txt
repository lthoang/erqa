Reviews:
We're big Nerf fans.
We've tried them all... from theNerf N-Strike Maverick, to theNerf N-Strike Stampede ECS, to theNerf N-Strike Vulcan EBF-25 Dart Blaster.
Summer time picnics often include an all out Nerf war, with kids and adults charging across the lawn, firing foam darts as they go.
The Zombie Strike Crossfire was a bit different, though - so we had to put it through its paces.
Unlike the Vulcan or the Stampede, you won't be able to rain down a hail of nerf darts on your opponents.
This stylized and compact crossbow only has four shots available on one reload.
Choose your targets carefully.
That said, we found the ZSC to be accurate and to have a respectable range.Again, because of our varied arsenal, we've had a chance to try different darts with the ZSC.
Most of them work, but the 'elite' darts, such as those that are included, work the best.
If you're planning on using this one outside, I'd invest in a pack of theClip System Darts 36pkwhich will stand out better when they drop into the lawn.
We've certainly lost a few wayward darts to the family lawnmower.
At the end of the day, this crossbow is a lot of fun, but we're still big fans of the clip-fed weapons like the Stampede or the Recon CS-6.
I enjoy toys that get my kids outside and playing and running.
I want things that do more than make noise when you push a button.
I want toys that encourage creativity and imagination.
Nerf guns and bows fill this perfectly.My eleven year old who has played with this much says this does not shoot as far as a typical nerf gun might be expected to shoot.
But the darts whistle so that is super cool.
Having watched it shoot I will say that it probably shoots 50 feet or so, maybe more as I'm not very good at eyeballing distances.Overall, the two young boys who have played with this the most have said it's a go to toy and that they would buy another one if this one broke.Enjoy.
All the kids in the neighborhood are jealous when my son brings this outside to play!
He says it's his favorite Nerf gun out of them all!
Nerf guns are for outdoors only in our house.
When the weather is warm they get a ton of use by our kids and the neighbors kids.
They take a huge pounding and get thrown, tosses, kicked, and shoved in an outdoor bin at clean up every night.
I've seen them get abused in all sorts of ways and they are still in good working order.
Made to last is a gig deal here s I do not like buying stuff over and over.
The only downside is that the gun should come with at least 20 bullets.
They only included a few.
We ordered this and let our 12 yr old son take it out for neighborhood Nerf wars with his friends.
They all wanted to try it out.
It does deliver a VERY strong push to the dart, sending it fairly far and accurately straight.
This is awesome if you are playing outside and wearing safety googles.
Not so awesome if you are his little sister he fired at 12 feet away- that one left a welt on her cheek and the toy in time out for a while.
If you are looking for a fun, older kid Nerf weapon, this is a good buy.
We (the adults) even tried it out with targets and outdoor range.
After a week through the woods and neighborhood kids trying it out (ages 6-13) this toy is still going strong and hasn't had any breakage issues, despite being dropped a few times on the street or thrown to another kid.
Recommended for good Nerf fun.
This crossbow is easy to aim and had a bit more force than most nerf guns we have.
This one is our new favorite.
Recently a group of six nerf-loving boys tried it out and loved it.
The only &#34;negative&#34; is that you can only load two &#34;arrows&#34; at a time, but this really is a fun toy.It is easy to load and re-load, it shoots a pretty decent distance and has enough speed across the distance to make you want to move out of the way.We are having lots of fun with this one.
Our family has tons of Nerf blaster products and we have been very impressed with the Zombie Strike line.
That extends to the Zombie Strike Crossfire Bow.
This is really one of the best pistols that Nerf has ever made for close range combat.The Zombie Strike Crossfire Bow has four barrels in the front and you cock the gun by sliding handle on top of the blaster.
This action makes it feel like you are cocking a real crossbow every time.
There is one tactical rail along the top so you can attach different Nerf rail accessories.
It also has an attachment on the back of the blaster for any standard Nerf rifle stock.
This allows for a lot of cool customization.It comes with 4 green Zombie Strike darts which seem to be the best of all Nerf elite darts.
While it can fire other Elite clip darts, they don't have near the range or power as the Zombie darts.Pros: The Zombie Strike Cross Fire bow is insanely accurate between 10-20 feet and extremely powerful.
This blaster packs quite a punch!
Like other blasters in the zombie line the detail, styling, and construction are top notch and rugged.Cons: Distance and accuracy drop substantially beyond 20-30 ft, and max out around 50ft.
Not too bad, but not as far as advertised.
However this con is diminished by the insane power and accuracy at close range.Wrap-up: This is one the absolute coolest and most FUN blasters our family has ever had.
In my opinion is second only to the Nerf Zombie Strike Hammershot as the very best pistol Nerf has made (and a close second at that).
Highly recommended!
"The Nerf Zombie Strike Crossfire Bow Toy is another great representative in a long line of Nerf shooters.
My son has several different models (includingNerf N-Strike Maverick,Nerf N-Strike Elite: Rough Cut 2X4 Blaster,Nerf N-Strike Elite Mega Magnus Blaster,Nerf N-Strike Recon CS-6 Dart Blaster, andNerf N-Strike Longshot CS-6) - all of which work somewhat similarly despite them having different looks or shooting styles.The Nerf Zombie Strike has four ""barrels"" that shoot in sequence one at a time after the gun is ""cocked"" by pulling back on the orange handle on the top of the gun.
This cocking action also pulls back the string and bends the ""crossbow"" on the front of the gun, but this is purely cosmetic.
Even if you take the crossbow part off the gun (and it somewhat easily detaches from the front of the gun and then with a push it ""clicks"" back on), the gun still cocks and fires in the same manner.
The ""crossbow bolts"" are the standard roughly 3/4"" foam darts with cushiony rubber tips (not suction cups), but are green and emblazoned with the ""Zombie Strike"" logo (similar to the other products in this line likeNerf Zombie Strike Dart Refill Pack,Nerf Zombie Strike Target Set,Nerf Zombie Strike Sidestrike Blaster,Nerf Zombie Strike Blade Toy, and others).
Despite the difference in appearance, any standard Nerf dart can be used on this gun.The gun fires very well and pretty far - I think 75 feet is an easily attainable ""average"" and we were able to shoot farther with relative ease.
The grip is also very comfortable and all three of my kids (6 to 13 yrs old) were able to easily cock and fire the gun without much problem.
The only issue I had is that the 2nd barrel started to weakly fire soon after we got the gun whenever the first barrel was fired.
This was pretty annoying since the gun only holds four darts (and there is no capability for a larger magazine like other Nerf products) so this put the person who used this gun at a further disadvantage after losing 1/4 of his pre-positioned ammo.
I'm not sure what the issue is - probably the firing mechanism isn't properly aligning - but I see other reviewers also noted this issue.Although I really liked the gun and how easy it was to fire, the ""only cosmetic"" crossbow hardware and the misfiring barrel caused me to drop my review to four stars."
This crossbow has been a lot of fun for my 9 year old and I.
You definitely need to pick up extra darts, but he loves that he can fire two shots before reloading, and you can have 2 darts on board for fast reload as well.
It seems more durable than some of the other nerf products we've purchased in the same price range.
With others we've had the pull back handle snap off, but this one is holding up really well.
Recommended!
This toy was great while it worked.
My 10 year old son had a blast shooting it with a friend of his.
The darts shot a nice distance and it was easy to use.
However, after 2-3 days the bottom dart will no longer go anywhere, it just sort of falls out.
Not sure if a spring broke or what happened but it definitely put a damper on the fun.
Maybe ours is defective but it was certainly a disappointment to have it stop working properly after only a couple days of use.
Nerf products, overall, usually work great.
We have several guns and even another bow model that work great.
Not sure what went wrong here.
This Gun, or Bow, whichever, is all around a good Gun.
It is really fun to pull back the Crossbow mechanism, and goes a good distance while still being fairly accurate.
Especially for a non battery powered Gun, which are usually less  accurate and consistent.
However, Nerf appears to be working on these problems, seeing as through the years their spring or air (however they work) powered guns have become much more reliable.
This gun is a nice length for easy and fast loading.
from my research there is at least a stock and sight available.Pros:- The built-in sight is extremely accurate to the point of hitting a golf ball from around 8' when using the top dart.- Nice length for easy and quick loading.- Maneuverable and light weight.- Mechanism is easy and fun to use- Interesting coloring, they really mixed them up.- Stock and sight available.Cons:- Sometime shoots 1 dart and spits the next so that only goes 4' or it spits the second dart halfway out of the gun so it falls out.- It was a little hard attaching the cross part, and it was not meant to be taken off for storage.- Only comes with 4 darts.
While we have not tried it on Zombies it has been fun love that it gets the kids outside active and required no battery $funds$.
It actually shoots very far and is durable.
My son absolutely loves this bow.
As of now we have 6 or 7 in our arsenal which is a great help when we have a house full of boys and there is a war being waged.
Lots of fun.
So far this has held up to a months play with several boys.
This Nerf Zombie Strike Crossbow is way too fun.
My son who loves everything Nerf was hardly willing to let go of it long enough to let the rest of us try it.The range is decent and not so powerful that I have to worry about losing it over a fence line.
I also recommend picking up extra darts especially if this is a gift.Things that &#34;kill&#34; Zombies seem to be all the rage across almost all age groups these days.
I recommend this toy for kids, teens and adults alike.
In fact I'm headed out to the local toy store to grab a few more for a back yard party this weekend.So what are you waiting for!?
Go grab yours today!
Yes I know this toy is recommended for ages 8 and up but my 4 year old daughter loves it.
The only problem she has with it is that she&#8217;s not strong enough to cock it so I do that for her.
She handles the rest of the mechanics involved just fine.
When she first opened up the box she asked incredulously, &#8220;is this a toy for boys?&#8221; but I explained that it&#8217;s for boys AND girls and she quickly got over it.
My daughter has lots of fun with it and she especially enjoys &#8220;hunting&#8221; with it.
The green &#8220;bolts&#8221; get lost easily in the outdoors because the neon green somehow blends with grass and bushes.
Fortunately, replacements are fairly cheap.
Orange would be a better color for the bolts.
The bottom line is that it&#8217;s fairly safe (wear eye protection), easy to use, and loads of fun.
Because of this product, I have already ordered another Nerf gun.
We have a number of Nerf guns in our house but this was the first crossbow!
I'll admit that I was a little off by the gimmicky zombie premise, but now that I've played with it for a bit I totally get why they decided to use the zombie idea!PROS:- Easy to set up.
The crossfire bow comes in two pieces but they are attached by the string.
Just put the crossbow piece in the front and you're ready to go!- Easy to use.
My cousin's 6 year old daughter was here and even she could pull back the trigger to shoot the bow!- Decent accuracy - honestly!- More power than you'd expect!
It is NOT hard to pull back the trigger so I didn't expect the power that we got from the bow!- Room to store your darts in the bow.CONS:- Only 4 darts come with the bow and we definitely wish that you got more!OVERALLThis is a fantastic addition to the Nerf series of gear and we can't wait to check out more of the Zombie collection!
Excellent addition to my husband's collection.
The front crossbow piece is easy to put on and take off.
It doesn't serve a function but looks cool.
You load 4 darts and it shoots one per pull of the trigger.
Love the color scheme on the Zombie crossfire pieces.
Serious power for this one.
My husband shot me point blank and it hurts!
I would advise making sure players shoot each other from farther away.
This is a pretty cool looking Nerf gun that my 8 year old likes playing with.
With that being said he was still disappointed (as was I) that the gun doesn't have a real crossbow action.
The bow part of it is fixed with elastic string tied to the guns cocking mechanism to give the illusion of a crossbow.
The strings could be totally removed and the gun would still function.
The gun also isn't the most accurate I have seen.
Even with those drawbacks it is still played with and enjoyed.
If you find it for a good price I'd say go for it and add it to your collection.
This is a blast.
It shoots as far as advertised except in the wind of course.
Sometimes the darts go astray, but for the most part it works great.
Smaller children can get their eyes poked, so have an adult present.
Buy extra darts.
It's a lot more fun then!
"My kids (girl 12, boy 11) absolutely love this crossbow.
Likes most kids, they're all about zombies right now.
My son watches The Walking Dead with his day and my daughter has seen a few episodes as well.
When they first saw this bow they both said the exact same thing, ""it's Darryl's gun from Walking Dead"".
They love it!The bow is packaged well and right out of the box it's super-easy to assemble and get started.
There is a small 2-sided sheet for instructions where the easy-to-follow, 4-step instructions are shown as pictures.
You'll have the bow assembled and be shooting withing 30 seconds or so.
The bow holds 4 darts and will shoot them one right after another.I find the bow itself very durable and easy to use.
My kids have no problem using it and they have a blast setting things up as a target and shooting at it.
The bow itself is pretty powerful.
The darts hit with a lot of power so you want to be sure that your kids know to never aim at anyone.
It may be something you want them to use outside or in a basement or something where you don't have to worry about anything getting knocked over or hit.
The recommend age is 8+ and I would pretty much agree with that.This is an awesome crossbow and I would highly recommend it."
Kids and adults alike loved this Nerf bow.
Standard regular Nerf arrows will fit in it with no problem and it has a unique multi arrow loader that I haven't seen on other Nerf products before.
While adults and older children were able to use it just fine a 5 year old did have a little trouble pulling the string far enough back to lock it in place but was able to do so with some practice and extra effort.Overall it's a great fun Nerf toy and feels very durable.
Over the last couple of years my 9 year old has assembled an arsenal of Nerf guns.
From pistols to rapid fire assault weapons he is ready for any invader (made of paper).
He was excited when I showed him this crossbow.
He has an older Nerf crossbow that shoots 8&#34; bolts, but that broke within a few weeks.
This crossbow is really nothing more than a Nerf pistol with a crossbow assembly fitted to it.
The bow serves no purpose other than aesthetic.He is enjoying this weapon, but I can see this is not his favorite (even though it is new).
The description on this page says:&#34;Nerf Zombie Strike CrossFire Bow BlasterThe Super Soaker Tri Strike Crossbow blaster is so versatile and easy to use, that you'll be armed with the ultimate in soaking power.
Slide the switch to open the crossbow arms, pump handle to fire, and blast away with three streams of water.
The arms easily close, letting you quickly change tactics, and defend yourself with a single stream for a focused, long-distance blast.
So, gear up, get going and get soaking!&#34;That description actually belongs to a different toy.
There is no water component to this gun.
If you search for Nerf Super Soaker crossbow you will see that one.
Even without the water component he is enjoying this gun.
This Nerf crossbow is a fun change from our other Nerf guns.
Our whole family has been enjoying playing with it.
It is easy to use.
It has a really good range on it and the darts shoot far.
There is also storage for four darts at once, which I find to be very handy.
The only problem we&#8217;ve had is that the force from the shot is so strong that it knocks the second dart out, which makes the shot veer instead of going straight.
Even so, this is a really fun toy and we are glad to have it.
Let me explain.
As I have mentioned in my previous reviews of Nerf Guns, I have a love/hate relationship with them.
I love that they are toys my boys actually play with.
They run around outside for hours on the weekend and play with their Nerf Guns whether they have the discs or not, but I hate that their favorites are just so big and a pain to store!That being said, this cross bow isn't very big.
It's a nice medium sized addition to their arsenal.
It's easy to grip, even for our six year old, and using is very simple to grasp.I will say I was surprised at the speed in which the little foam bullets fly out!
My husband's lip and my cheek are a testament to that.
(Yes, our kids know not to fire at unsuspecting people, and yes they have been told that faces are off limits.)
We were quite far away from the kids, and I think they were shocked that the bullets reached us and still had enough speed to surprise us with quite a bit of sting.Price wise this is a bit pricier than many of the other options of this size, but at least the 'bullets' it uses are the same standard ones that all Nerf guns have, so nothing unique or fancy required here.I think this one is a winner, just make sure the kids aren't aiming anywhere near ya when they're playing
