My family are big time game players and this one just didn't excite us.
Also, the age appropriateness for this game is much higher, there's no way an 8-12 yr. old would know most of the answers and they just want to say CRAP anyway!
My mom lost but I felt it was good for her to be pressured to try and think fast and she was surprised that she got a lot of the answers correct.

Reviews:
"I found ""Fact Or Crap"" to be...well...kind of crappy.
There's some solid questions, but the way the game is set up it becomes confusing and monotonous pretty quickly.
There are several other, far better, trivia games available; I'd give this one a pass."
"My family loves board games and plays them often.
We were very excited to try out this new one.
After playing it, we were quite disappointed.
I think the makers of this game expected it to sell based on it's rather edgy name, ""Fact or Crap.
""In each round, a player reads three true/false statements, none of which relate to each other, and the other players decide whether the statement is ""fact"" or ""crap.""
Players get points for answering right and lose points for answering wrong.
Occasionally, you'll get cards that have one player read five questions to another player only, and that player gets points for right answers while the reader gets points from the wrong answers - at least until the timer runs out.This game can go on for a very very long time- until all the chips are gone.
Really, the ""facts"" are so obscure that it is truly just a guessing game.
For true trivia games, there are much better games out there- Trivial Pursuit for example.As a result, playability and especially replayability are low with this game.
It's a trivia game that requires no knowledge of trivia at all - just a keen ear for what sounds right (and thus isn't) and what sounds wrong (and therefore isn't).Unfortunately, this game is not recommended."
Fact or Crap is a simple game, with very little strategy involved.
The goal is to quickly and accurately determine whether statements are true.
Or not.
The game includes a deck of Fact or Crap cards and a deck of Rush Hour Cards (which, curiously, get shuffled together).
Each Fact or Crap Card contains three statements -- and each statement is either -- you got it -- fact or crap.
Rush Hour cards are strikingly similar to Fact or Crap cards -- Rush Hour cards contain five statements, and each statement is either fact or crap.
Players compete to be the first to correctly determine whether a statement is true or false.
Correct answers are rewarded with cardboard Fact or Crap tokens, and incorrect answers require players to give up tokens.
Rush Hour cards require one person to assess all five facts within the time constraints imposed by an hourglass.
I'm guessing that this game is just as much (or maybe even more) fun without the tokens and timer.I played this briefly with a friend who has a graduate degree in history -- he was able to get the right answer dang near 100% of the time and got bored after about six cards.
It might be more fun to play with someone who didn't have the same knowledge of geography and history, in which case the answers would be more guesses.
Some of the facts are marginally interesting -- who knew that turtles can breath through their butts, Ginsu knives were originally made in Fremont, Ohio, or that Popeye's fouir nephewes are Pipeye, Peepeye, Pupeue, and Poopeye.
It could be fun to pull out the cards once in a while just for grins, but it won't displace any of our favorite, more timeless board games.
We have really been enjoying this game for a long time now!
It is a lot educational, and our foreign exchange student has learned a lot while being in this country just from this game alone.
It's a good way to kill off a rainy day weekend.
Glad they make new versions all the time!
"This game became boring real quick.
There is a huge pile of fact or crap question cards and the game doesn't end until all but one player loses their tokens or the middle pile is gone (impossible).
There is no way this game is over quickly.
After an hour or so of stupid questions we all just agreed to quit.There is little educational value because you're not given the right answer.
Example of Question card:1.
The sun is so big you could fit more than 100,000 earths inside it?2.
Tycho Brahe the astronomer wore an artificial nose made of gold and silver?3.
The plastic things on the end of the shoelaces are called aglets?Example of Rush Hour card:1.
In ancient Greece ""idiot"" meant a private citizen or layman?2.
It is possible to sneeze with your eyes open?3.
The yo-yo was originally a weapon in Philippines?4.
Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise?5.
Dogs are color blind?Well all anybody does is throw down a FACT or CRAP card.
If something turns out to be CRAP, you don't know what the true answer was.
This game could have been a really nice alternative to Trival Pursuit but you don't ever learn the right answer.We were done after the first hour and won't be playing this again anytime soon.
Also, the age appropriateness for this game is much higher, there's no way an 8-12 yr. old would know most of the answers and they just want to say CRAP anyway!
"Me, my husband and my 84 year old  mother played this game last Sunday for the first time and we had a lot of fun.
The rules are not complicated which I appreciate.
My mom lost but I felt it was good for her to be pressured to try and think fast and she was surprised that she got a lot of the answers correct.
This game can last a long time so either set aside a couple of hours or be able to put the game somewhere where you can pick up where you left off at another time.My husband won but it was a hard fought battle.
The statements on the cards are pretty darn interesting and very creative.
The only reason I'm deducting a star is because I went through a large portion of the cards and noticed that MANY had either two ""craps"" and one ""fact"", or two ""facts"" and one ""crap"" so that by simply keeping up with the results of the first two questions can almost guarantee a correct answer on the third.
There were some cards that did have three ""craps"" or ""facts"" but not as many as I think there should have been.The game comes with a LOT of statement cards (which I'm going to assume were well researched with correct ""fact"" or ""crap"" applied) but I don't know if more cards can be ordered after you've learned the ones that came with the game.
The ""rush hour"" cards are necessary to keep you in tokens lest you run out early and lose the game.
It's all a lot of fun even if you don't have a clue to the statement's validity.
So, even though the box lid says it's to be played by those 12+ I think it could be played by those younger than 12 if they can read well, and make quick decisions to not slow the game down.
Though my 9 year old didn't play, I think she could have handled the game pretty well.It's fun, entertaining and enlightening all at the same time.
Good game."
I remember a few years a ago playing this game with my wife's brother and it being pretty fun.
We picked this game up and played it with some good friends.
My expectations going in were a ton of trivia that I would have knowledge of.
That was hardly the case.The questions were quite difficult as the point was more guessing the right answer instead of knowing the right answer.The point of the game is to get the most right answers and be the one with the most points or the last one with tokens.
Strategy is minimal in the game.
There are two places where it exists.
One, you can gain two tokens if you are the first person to answer (and lose two tokens if you are wrong) instead of one.
The second, picking an individual to do the rush hour card.
This is where an individual gets to answer up to 5 questions and can win or lose a combination of five tokens.We cut the game short when we had only two people left with tokens.
Trying to whittle it down to one would have been tedious and boring for both the people out of the game and those playing.In our shortened game, we went through about 1/3 of the cards.
It would be really easy to whip through the rest and then have to recirculate through cards you already saw.It's OK, I'd say balderdash would be a little more fun for a game with basically the same concept.UPDATE: We were playing outside in varied lighting conditions (i.e.
- sunshine).
My wife was able to see through the cards and tell which ones were fact read by two out of the three players.
This could be a problem in natural light situations.
"My kids really love this game...especially my daughter.
It is a game where one player chooses to read either a true trivia-type of statement or one that is made up.
The other players have to guess if it is fact or ""crap.""
I think my kids like that it used the word ""crap!""
ha ha!
!It gets interesting to see more of the strategy used to look at the reader (""she always smiles when she lies!"")
rather than people really knowing the answers!
Plus, even if you aren't good at trivia, you can still play!
My kids are just getting old enough to like these type of games, and are too old for kid games, so it is a nice transition.The Listeners (the rest of the players) have to vote on if they think the statement was fact or crap by voting with a card (that say ""Fact"" or ""Crap""...of course!)
I do think it is a little difficult for the Reader to decide who among the Listeners voted first (because that person gets or loses more tokens.)
In my family, Dad was always the one who was umpire.
When he read, we put the two voting cards on the table and everyone had to grab for one.
After the first grab-vote, the rest voted.
It wasn't perfect...but we did try to modify it a little.
I do think there should be someone to be the final decision on voting (if it is close.)
It just helps avoid kids arguing.
My family found answering the trivia questions fun, but the scoring and record keeping added nothing to the game.
The scoring involves taking or paying 1 or 2 little cardboard paper discs based on getting the answer right/wrong, being the first to answer, or not first.
Each player gets a fact or crap card which they must slap down on the play table to declare their guess, hoping to be the fastest at doing so (to earn 2 discs instead of just 1 for each correct guess).
I don't think the fact or crap cards will hold up well to this reaching, grabbing, slapping them down on the table game play.
I could see just answering the trivia cards for the fun of it and not even bothering to keep track of scoring.
It won't be a game I reach for often at all.
My family are big time game players and this one just didn't excite us.
"This game is kind of fun - it's for 3 or more players, and you basically get a statement read to you and guess if it's true or not.
There are no buzzers, so you have to figure out how to ""buzz in"" without anything.
Plus with most of the statements, there's really no way anybody could know if they're true, so it's really just guessing - not like trivia.
Not my first choice if I had to play something.
Just my honest opinion!UPDATE: I took this to my parents' house to play during Christmas, and everyone pretty much hated it.
My mom read the instructions aloud, and everyone decided they were ""stupid,"" and she decided to just read the questions aloud and everyone would say if they thought the item was true or false, and just not keep score.
There are 2 different kinds of question cards - regular and lightning-round.
They are packaged separately but the game tells you to mix them together.
My mom did this, and then decided the lightning-round cards' questions were way shorter and thus easier to read, so she skipped the regular cards as she came to them.As we all guessed on each question, it was kind of boring.
My dad pronounced the game of Fact or Crap was indeed crap, and that we should regift it to someone that we don't like.So I guess I'm not an expert on the official way to play this game, but I couldn't even get my family to play this the proper way, so I would not recommend it.
:o("
My children initially enjoyed this game, mostly because they liked the trivia questions, but after a few rounds of playing, and knowing that their younger brother was guessing all the answers and STILL doing quite well, it became less enjoyable.
As others have noted, you basically have a 50/50 chance of getting it right.
Still, it kept my kids entertained for a bit and they still enjoy the questions and learning the answers.
I wish it had some follow up information on the topics, but as it is, if my kids are interested in a subject they go to the computer and look it up, so in that way it has been educational.
Still, not the greatest game but acceptable.
A fun little game.
The questions are an odd range of obvious to obscure, but it's good for a broader audience since you don't actually have to know all this stuff - you just have to have a good, logical crap-detector.
We played with 3 and it's probably a bit better with 4 or 5.
A nice thing is that if you want to play a quicker game, it's easy to modify it by using fewer tokens.
My only complaint is that the tokens are cardboard and you have to punch them out yourself - a set of plastic poker chips would have been nice.
3.5 stars.
