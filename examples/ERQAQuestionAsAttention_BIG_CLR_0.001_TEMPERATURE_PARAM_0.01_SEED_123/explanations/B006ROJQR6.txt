This Thomas is another great toy for my kids to entertain themselves with.The pieces fit together easily and at 24 pieces it doesn't take my 4 year old a terrible lot of time to put it together and move on to the next one.

Reviews:
This is a great idea.
Our grandson is really taken with these big puzzles and of course I love giving them thanks to amazon-vine program.Grandson is 4 and he really likes this size, of course now I need to get him one with more pieces &lt;G> He is a puzzle fan anyway and this being so big makes him even happier.This is our second and they are contrusted so well.
He has put together several times and they show no wear at all.
It's like they are brand new each time.
The box shaped like a train is well constructed too and will last a long time!We're looking forward to our 10 month grandson being able to put the big puzzles together too and I'm sure the time will pass before we know it.
Having little kids means floor puzzles.
This Thomas is another great toy for my kids to entertain themselves with.The pieces fit together easily and at 24 pieces it doesn't take my 4 year old a terrible lot of time to put it together and move on to the next one.
I would say that my 5 a child will have outgrown this puzzle.
At the same time my near two year old can fit the pieces together if someone gives her two.
She cannot locate two pieces to fit together.
Both children are very proud and excited to see the final result.
The picture is very colorful and pleasing.
"This is a beautiful puzzle!
The picture of Thomas and Charlie is very colorful with lots of background details.
The finished puzzle measures 27"" x 19 1/4"" which is larger than most puzzles.
Each puzzle piece is approximately 6"" x 6"".
These large pieces make it easier for young children to put together.
The age range shown on the box is 3+.
My 3 yr old granddaughter wasn't interested in it at all.
She just couldn't make the pieces fit together.
I think it's a little too much for a 3 yr. old.
The 4 yr. old liked putting it together but needed quite a bit of help to do so.The puzzle pieces are made of very heavy and sturdy cardboard.
I believe this puzzle will hold up quite well.
Overall a nice quality puzzle."
My little 2 & 3 year old nephews LOVE Thomas, and any puzzle with Thomas is always going to be a winner.
The case this comes in is sturdy and very useful, even if you don't keep the puzzle pieces in it.
The pieces are thick and sturdy - great for kids that are still in a chewing phase.
The puzzle is only about 25 pieces and not too challenging.
It's most appropriate for 3-5 year old range.The puzzle is very colorful and comes together quite nicely.
Highly recommended!
This puzzle is sturdy & colorful for any child or parent to enjoy having around.
The pieces are well fitted with large connections that allow the puzzle to be moved as needed.
The color, shape, & design will help the child develope in visual, cognitive, & affective skills.
The only slight drawback is the opening of the box.
The idea of opening it like a train barn is great but the smaller child may have trouble with the tab complexity needed to get into the box.
However, that could be a plus since kids will find a way in:).
This is our third floor puzzle of the Thomas and Friends collection and we continue to love them.
A big puzzle is a nice change up for my son from his typical small ones, especially when he sees the final product covering a large portion of the floor!
They do a great job making the pieces thick enough that they are not going to be too easily destroyed and the larger pieces makes it easy for him to see and manipulate them.
Even the train shaped box adds a little fun to the project.
A great activity to do with your child.
Also, I do think age 3-5 would be the most ideal ages for this puzzle.
This puzzle has been a absolute hit with both my nearly 2 year old son and my 4 1/2 year old daughter.
I found the pieces to be extremely durable and they were large enough for my children's little hands to handle with ease.I love that both my kids have enjoyed this puzzle quite a bit.
My daughter was able to put together this puzzle all on her own easily.
My son whom is younger had a bit of trouble so I helped him find the right pieces and he easily put them in the right place.
The puzzle is very colorful and the playability factor to use over and over again has happened quite a bit for us.I would highly recommend this puzzle and other's from Ravenburger.
Puzzles are great educational tool in promoting the development of fine motor skills, association, task completion and independent play.
We also thought it was pretty cool that the puzzle box itself is shaped like Thomas the Tank Engine as well!
The puzzle arrived in its train shaped box.
Which is fun to look at but I have a feeling can easily get damaged when opened a closed by kids.
The pieces are big and go together easily.
I liked that once they were together they did not fall apart when other pieces where being added..
I would have likes to have had a bigger picture to refer to for my son.
Overall the puzzle seems durable and encourages your child to observe and make conclusions about the pieces.
For children that are good at puzzles and do them easily this puzzle will probably be too easy.
But for a child that is just starting out on bigger puzzles this is a nice one to start with and practice with.
I guess maybe my son doesn't really like puzzles.
This one didn't hold his attention at about 3 years old.
Your success may vary.
Anyway, it's basically just a cardboard puzzle.
"This is our second Thomas & Friends floor puzzle, and my 3.5 yo loves it just like the first one.
It measures about 27"" x 19"", with each of the 24 pieces being about 4.5"" square, a nice size for little hands to manipulate.
The pieces are made out of thick durable cardboard and fit together beautifully.
The puzzle is colorful and very visually appealing.
Only minor peeve is that the box is made out of a very sturdy cardboard, but because of it's unusual shape is not going to hold up as well as a standard puzzle box (tends to collapse on itself)."
I got this for a somewhat delayed boy who loves Thomas, and it has proven to be a double-duty toy.
The little one loves putting the large puzzle pieces together, but even more, loves to then use the assembled puzzle as a mat for playing with his Thomas trains.
I think if he lived in a larger home, the family would glue the pieces together to make it more sturdy and permanent as a play mat, but as it is, once assembled the puzzle serves well for his attention span.
The pieces are brightly colored and cheerful, and, since the puzzle is made by the amazing Ravensberger company, they are so well made and sturdy.
The box, shaped like a train, has added play value, which makes this a terrific toy.
"I ordered this puzzle for my 23 month old son who has recently fallen in love with trains, train whistles, and all things Thomas.
He's younger than the recommended age of 3+ listed on the puzzle, and therefore too young to complete the puzzle on his own, but this is an excellent starter puzzle for him.
The puzzle pieces are huge, and that means I don't have to worry about either him eating or losing pieces.The box is what you see in the product description; it's sort of train shaped, and well-secured, so my son could walk around with it while ""choo-chooing"" his way to me to ask to put it together.
I LOVED his reaction when we first put the puzzle together; he's seen his sister put together puzzles, but the pieces are always too little for him.
The first time we put this puzzle together, I had to place all the pieces and he just patted the puzzle down when we were done.
We've put it together at least 10 more times in the last three days, and he's actually making the attempt now to put it together.
He can't really do it, but I can see him thinking about it and trying to figure it out.The quality of the box and the pieces is wonderful.
We've gotten some really cute looking puzzles in the past that had pieces that were almost interchangeable and really too small for a child.
But I really like the size and quality of these pieces.This is the second Ravensburger product that I've had the opportunity to try out, and I'm increasingly impressed by the quality of the workmanship and materials in their products!"
This is my second Thomas floor puzzle and I have been very happy with both of them.
The kids repeatedly take it out and build it, and the pieces hold up very well.
The kids love the shape of the box, too.
I would definitely buy more of these.
"My God son, the moment he saw the box screamed ""Thomas!!!!""
when we opened the box, he screamed ""Puzzle!!!!!""
It was adorable!
I knew he would love this puzzle, as he loves both Thomas and puzzle's, but he loved it even more than I had hoped.
:)  He loves the picture on it, he loves pointing out all the different stuff on, the different trains and helicopters, etc.I love the box, it is cute in and of itself, and the puzzle is very thick and durable, the edges are just big enough that they cannot be easily bent, perfect for smaller children.If your young kids like Thomas and puzzle, this is awesome!!
!God Bless ~Amy"
My six-year-old LOVES thomas the train and enjoys the big floor puzzles.
I got this for him for his birthday.
I think he might be a little old for it, but it was still fun for him.
I think this would be a great starter puzzle for a kid a year or two younger than him.It's well-made and a good quality and comes in a cute little box!
It's also a pretty good size when it's fully done.
Definitely made for the floor!I'd recommend it.
It's cute!
i sent this to my niece and her husband for my great nephew who just turned one, he loves Thomas the train and loves puzzles so it seemed perfect for him to try it out- my niece said they had a fun family night with the little one putting together the puzzle and it held my great nephew's attention and he helped place the pieces and was interested in putting it together.
my niece is very excited to have such a nice puzzle to add to his toys.
i suggest this puzzle for any Thomas the train lover :)
The only reason why I don't give this puzzle five stars is the price; I think $12 is a little steep for a 24-piece puzzle.
For Christmas, I had a custom 500-piece puzzle made from a photograph of my family, and it was $30 including shipping from Germany, so perhaps I may be hypercritical about it... but that is the only thing I can be critical about.The puzzle is beautiful, cleanly-cut, colorful, sturdy, durable, and my nearly four-year-old son loves putting it together with his Memere and Pepere.
He's done it at least 30 or 40 times so far, and it's not getting old.
:^)Not only would I highly recommend this puzzle, I am looking forward to buying more Ravensburger puzzles... even though I may still complain about it being $12.
:^)
"My nieces and nephew (3 1/2 years old) loved this  puzzle because it's brightly colored and very engaging!
All Ravensburger brand puzzles that I have purchased in the past, including this one, are high quality and durable cardboard stock that snap into place with no small gaps in between like other puzzles I've purchased.
The pieces are thick, large, and are perfect for small hands to work on fine motor skills and spatial reasoning while lining up the pieces.
The images on the pieces are firmly attached so they won't peel off either.Even the box is engaging - it's shaped like Thomas and my nieces and nephew even enjoyed playing with the box and rolling it across the floor like a toy train.
The finished puzzle is about 27"" by 19"" and I'd highly recommend it for little Thomas the Train enthusiasts!"
My Son Loves Thomas and also Bob the Builder so this seemed like a natural fit for him.The great part about it is that the pieces are large colorful and not numerous enough to overwhelm him.He really loved putting it together with his Mom and it really improved his orientation and spatial skills while he was having fun.
After the first build we let him put it together again on his own which he successfully did with a little help here and there :)  After that he wanted to put it together without any help and soon he succeeded :)Like all puzzles it does have a finite fun factor but you can extend that by making it into a time test, kids love to beat the clock and see if they can do it faster and faster and in the process they further develop their skills in shape and spatial recognition.
A cute little puzzle for kids that like Thomas.
The box itself is fun and the puzzle is colorful and sturdy.
The pieces are large easy to use.
Good for a parent to do with a kinder gardener or a fun hand eye coordination activity for a homeschooler.
This Thomas & Charlie puzzle is gigantic!
My four-year-old loves putting it together.
Once completed, the colors really are beautiful to look at.
Especially fun is the box in which the puzzle is housed.
It is loosely shaped like a train, which is something different.
I wouldn't say the puzzle is particularly difficult.
I helped my child put it together the first time and she's had no trouble since.
The sheer size makes it an impressive keepsake in her eyes, and, as I said, the colors are vibrant and pleasing to view.
It must be said, my 4 year old son loves Thomas.
Thomas puzzles, toys, sheets--you name it he loves it.
So when this puzzle came up as an option in Vine, it was the perfect opportunity to check out something that we both could enjoy testing.
The 24 piece floor puzzle size and subject matter meant that it would be perfect for a four year old to tackle.We have several Ravensburger puzzles, and I have not been at all disappointed by the quality of the puzzles that this manufacturer has produced.
The pieces are solid, sturdy and easy to fit together.
The cut between individual pieces has been done smoothly enough that young children will not find it difficult to connect one piece to another, even if they are still working on their physical dexterity and small motor skills.
Unlike the other puzzles that came in rather cheap plastic boxes that I wasn't too enamored of, this one comes in a cute cardboard train box that can be a toy in and of itself.As far as putting it together--I had planned to do this puzzle with my son, but I guess he got too excited and got the pieces out while I was busy putting his baby sister down for a nap.
When I returned he had managed to put the entire thing together by himself--to his incredible delight and satisfaction.
Unlike earlier puzzles we bought with smaller and more numerous pieces, this floor puzzle suits his needs perfectly.
Younger children may need some help to put the entire image together, but Preschool age children and likely to have little trouble with this as an independent project.A great learning and entertaining activity for my son!Happy Puzzling!

My three-year-old loves Thomas, and loves this puzzle.
It's big and durable, with a colorful picture.
The 24 large pieces are enough to make it a challenge, but not so many that its too hard and she loses interest.
The larger pieces are also more difficult to misplace.
Highly recommended.
"This big Thomas the Train puzzle is great.
My 3 year old grandson has not been a fan of puzzles for a while, but I thought I'd try this one for him, since he LOVES Thomas and the puzzle isn't the usual ""wooden piece"" type that he is used to.
This puzzle was a hit!!
My grandson was so interested in seeing the picture that putting the pieces together was no problem for him.
He was impressed with the box and it captured his attention right away.
Although there is no guarantee that some pieces won't ""go missing"" as is the case with most of our puzzles, at least the pieces of this puzzle are large enough to see easily and are sturdy enough to withstand a little ""lost and found.""
I'm quite pleased with this puzzle and will consider purchasing the others in the  ""Thomas"" series."
"Just like my seven year old once did, my three year old has a passionate, on-going love affair with all things Thomas and Friends.
Train sets, many if not most of the Sodor engines, DVDs, books, puzzles, you name it, we have it.
And my wife is so enchanted by how much they both enjoy Thomas, she's already made plans to save much of our Thomas paraphernalia for any future grandchildren.
(Oh well, more stuff to store in the basement for the next 20 years.)
But of all the things we do have, one thing we didn't have is a Thomas floor puzzle.
Until now.
So, here are my thoughts on the ""Thomas & Friends: Thomas and Charlie 24 Piece Floor Puzzle"".Pros:- The pieces really are big, and are of various large sizes.
(I measured one at 7 inches by 5 inches, and another at 6 inches by 6 inches.)
The sizes of the pieces make them very 3-year old friendly.- The puzzle has a matt-like texture which should make it easy to wipe up accidental spills and messy hand-prints, and the puzzle picture itself is sharp and clear- The cardboard puzzle pieces are nice and thick and should stand up well to inadvertent abuse from impatient little fingers- The puzzle comes in a train-shaped box, which I personally found pretty neat.
(Ok, I like Thomas too ... either that, or after watching hundreds of hours of Thomas the Tank Engine shows, I've been brainwashed.
)Cons:- With the possible exception of the asking price perhaps being a tad high, I can't think of a single one.
But as it's a high quality puzzle, it's worth a bit more, too.Overall ... if you've got a small boy or girl, say from ages 2 to 5, who can name more than 20 Sodor engines, you really should get them this fun floor puzzle.
Me, I'm now looking for the ""next"" Thomas thing for my kids ... maybe a radio controlled engine.
No, wait, we already have an R/C Molly.
Well, I'm sure Santa will think of something between now and Christmas ... .
:-)  Five stars."
