Reviews:
Out of the box Moon Dough Magic Barnyard assembles in a minute and a half, easy.
The dough isn't cohesive, so it needs to be pounded into the barn which functions as a large multi-mold that you crank.
Its a lot of fun to do, and the whole family got a kick out of it.
After a few tries, my five year old could manage it without assistance.
Which animal falls down the slide?
It could be a cow, chicken, pig or sheep, and the barn actually surprises you every time.
The result is a small figurine which we can then play with.
You can also use the accompanying molds to make fencing and hay to complete your farm scene.
And since it doesn't dry out, we can mash it back up and start all over again tomorrow.
The kids really enjoyed it.After you get over the bizarre texture, I have two complaints:  One is that the toy doesn't come with anything more than a baggy to store it.
The other is that since it doesn't stick together, so it is messy.
"this is a different interpretation of dough consistency on play-dough.
unlike play-dough which is, well, doughy, this is very crumbly and is just ""doughy"" enough to hold its shapes.
the moon dough feels chalky and reminds me of styrofoam, kind of like those orange peanut candies, except crumbly.
it's very lightweight.pros:- fun for preschoolers.- does not dry out, so no need to store in a plastic container.- easier to gather than play-dough.
just lightly press the bigger chunk against the smaller one.- produces finely detailed molds.
quite amazing really.- safe for gluten-sensitive folks.- doesn't stain durable, hard surfaces.cons:- very, very crumbly and messy!
the dough flakes get everywhere, so unless you're painstakingly able to recapture all the flakes, you're gonna need to replace the dough quickly.- can't mold independent shapes due to the dough's extreme flakiness, so not the most creative method of play.- definitely can't carry the molded shapes around.- the dough has to be compacted down very firmly to get the best molds, so the younger ones need help.- the crank is tough to turn for the younger ones.- tough to unmold the plastic fence and barn for the younger preschoolers.- if you have hardwood floor and some residue get on it, the floor becomes extremely slippery.
BE CAREFUL!!
!yes, it's messy, but so is playdough which is sticky AND dries out.
if you think this will make craft-time mess-free, you'll be disappointed, but it is swept away quickly.
because of the crumbly nature of moon dough, the kids are limited to the shapes this kit allows.
no doubt that it's fun to play and to squish, but younger preschoolers would need help with packing the mold, unmolding and cranking.
older kids can play with this fine, but then when you're only able to get 4 animals, a fence and a bale of hay, it gets old quick.
so the toy doesn't end up being ideally appropriate for any age group.the ideal scenario for this toy if the adult caregiver wants to, uh, ""encourage independent play"" is:- a 3-year-old and a 6- or 7-year-old who get along well, i.e.
the older one enjoys helping the younger one.- hardwood floors.
linoleum or tiles if you have a vacuum cleaner."
I was hoping for something a little bit more like Playdough but that's not the case.
Evidently the surface of the moon is really dusty and crumbly because that's what Moon Dough is too.
Dusty, crumbly stuff that falls apart without a lot of pressure.
Right out the box, the Moon Dough basically fell apart into thousands of little pieces.
And this is probably fine and well but having a small child playing with this stuff translates into a huge mess.To actually make an animal, you really have to stuff the Moon Dough into the small slot.
And I mean you really need an adult's level of cordination and strength to push enough of the dough to fill in all of the nooks and crannies.
Once you do that, you can turn the crank and out comes an animal.
Neat, yes.
But the dough is just not fun at all.
We were thinking of trying Playdough with this toy to see if it works better but have not gotten around to it.
And unfortunately, after all of the work of squishing the dough together to make an animal, my son really could not care less about the animals.Lastly, and I'm not sure if it's me or not, but I swear that it made my hands itchy.
I had no red marks and didn't break out in any rash.
But my hands just felt itchy afterwards.
I know that the product is supposed to be free of allergens but maybe I was having a reaction after all.Long story, next time, Playdough.
"This play set comes with three pouches of Moon Dough - white, blue and yellow.
It has a barn (you have to attach the crank, the output slot, the silo, and snap the barn onto the green stand).
There is a fence mold and a hay bale mold.
From box to playing in minutes.The hay bale mold is a little ""sticky"" - my children needed assistance with getting the bales out of the mold.
All of the other molds, including the rotating animal mold, worked flawlessly.As the Dough comes in pouches, you will need to transfer it into containers for future use.
I used disposable Glad Ware or Ziploc small containers for this.The educational value of this toy lies in the fine motor skills required to smoosh the Moon Dough into the animal mold, fence mold or hay mold.
Your child will need to use finger dexterity and strength to push the Dough down and into the mold.
Children also have to use arm coordination and strength to turn the crank that releases the animal ""surprise"" from the rotating mold, learning to turn the crank in the correct direction.
Finally, once the pieces are molded, children use their imaginations to make scenes with the animals on their farm.The Dough itself is very, very light.
It is almost light like styrofoam.
When pressed firmly together, it holds shape and texture nicely so children can play with and manipulate the pieces they make.Is this a ""messy"" toy?
Is Play-Doh messy?
Is Moon Sand messy?
Mess is part of life when you have small children.
I have found that the best way to contain the mess is to place the toy in the center of a full sheet pan, or let them play with it outside on the porch.
The advantage to using a catch-all tray is that the Dough can be easily recycled back into containers after play time is over.My three year old adored this toy.
My kids received the Moon Dough last evening when I wasn't home.
They had it opened and were playing with it when I came home and had a huge mess on the living room coffee table.
Their father had let them open the moon dough and of course they had it everywhere.
Needless to say, as the other reviews say, it is a bit messy but it doesn't take no time to clean up because its dry (unlike playdoh).
I do not have carpet so I have no idea how it would be getting out of carpet.We all played with the barnyard even my 13 year old.
The moon dough has a strange consistency, sort of like cotton candy without the stickiness.
The kids liked to play with the barnyard, cranking out horses, cows, chickens and don't forget the sheep!
Sometimes you'll have to get a pencil or something long and slender to clear out the insides but since the moon dough doesn't dry out that's no problem.They come with molds for haystacks and for a picket fences.
Small kids may need help getting their haystacks and fences out the mold but the instructions explain fairly well how to get the molds out (basically like you would use an ice tray).I think the toy is made very well of heavy plastic.
The moon dough is kinda messy but is easily cleaned up.
It doesn't get hardened rock like playdoh does.The kids are already for me to get he diner and the dog house too!
But it is really fun as long as your kids have a nice big table or cleared floor area to play on.I only gave it four stars because it does make a mess but overall its plenty fun and it doesn't let you give half stars or I would have given it 4 1/2 stars!
"We had a lot of fun with the Moon Dough Barn.
It comes with a hay and fence mold, 3 colors of moon dough and a barn that has animals molds inside it.
You fill the molds inside the barn, crank the handle and animals slide out the bottom ramp.
Some assembly is required but it's just snapping some things together.
The dough is a crumbly material that needs to be worked to stay together.
I worked ours while it was still in the bag so it was ready to go when I handed it to my boys.The degree of mess and how well the dough comes out of the molds will probably be based on the age of those using it and how neat or messy they are.Me, an adult, I could keep the dough pressed together and placed the dough in the barn molds so that my animals came out perfect.
They were hard, perfectly molded and really cute.
The trick, use your finger and work the dough into each crevice of the mold and pack them tight.My 5 year old did pretty good making the molds too but he was much messier than I was and ended up with some on the floor and his clothes.My 3 year old couldn't make the animals as well because he wasn't filling the molds up correctly and of course, he was the messiest.
This wasn't discouraging to him at all, he had just as much fun as everyone else so it's not one of those things that are frustrating for the younger kids.That all being said, my boys loved it.
I'll probably let them use it outside next time because I did have to clean up and vacuum after they were finished but it did vacuum up easily, even the pieces that were squished into the carpet.
I have to say too that my boys make just as big of a mess with Play Doh.They can't wait to play with it again.
They said ""Momma, that was really fun, let's play again.""
I really liked it too, especially the molded animals.
We've bought some additional Moon Dough sets because we liked this one so much."
"If your kids love the moon sand, you may be tempted to purchase this item.
The item's concept is a good one.
You have a ""magical"" molding barn, silo and play mat along with several molds that allow you to make farm animals out of the moon dough.The toy says it is not intended for kids under three years old, however, the molds need a strong hand to push the moon dough into the crevices and many kids don't have the strength to do this easily without a parent present--which means this is not a toy that a child can play with independently.
The other issue is with the way the moon dough molds work.
After you push the dough in you need to turn the barn crank slowly or else the dough doesn't form correctly and little fingers can get pinched.We did not find the dough as crumbly as many reviewers did.
After working with it, the dough firmed up.
That said, like any type of dough--play-doh, moon sand etc., you probably should either use this outside or on a mat.
Like many of the doughs/dohs--if it dries or gets ground into a carpet, it becomes a real challenge to vacuum up.The kids did enjoy 'squishing' and 'squashing' it in their hands.
They also experimented with using cooking cutters to make additional animals.
The kids did have a lot of fun with the mold and the moon dough after they got the rhythm of the toy down--how to press the dough into the mold and how to crank it out."
For ages 4 and up.
Yes, you do really have to squish it hard but it is great fun.
Love that it does not stick to carpet or my kids clothes.Got for my Aspergers(high function autism) 12 year old.
He loves cows and loves doing things with his hands & moon dough is perfect.
He asked for the moon sand for last Christmas and this year he found out about moon dough.Everyone in my family loves to play with this even the old folks 50+ and  my 4 year old grandson loves this too, so great for 4 and up.
Not for under 4 since they do tend to put everything in thier mouths.
I like this product because it reminds me of some of the great Play Doh toys I had as a kid.
It is a lot of fun and my son really enjoys playing with it.
He can't help himself when it comes to mixing the colors of the dough, which ultimately turns it into a muddled mess, but making the barnyard shapes is a lot of fun for him.
He is two years old and I feel this toy is fine for his age, so long as he is continually supervised by an adult.
I don't necessarily find the quality of the dough any better than that of Play Doh (as is claimed).
It WILL indeed dry out if it is not put into a container after play.
I don't know how educational it is when all is said and done, but it does aid in development of motor skills and I feel the set (which includes the two containers of dough) is fairly priced.
"Unlike many reviewers, I had absolutely no complaints about the moon dough's consistency.
This is very much like a product called Bubber.
It handles differently than Play-doh.
Its strengths are the ability to hold sharp precision edges, like with molds or cookie cutters.
It vacuums up beautifully and doesn't become part of the carpet.
It doesn't dry out.
I am happy enough with the moon dough itself, though I would suggest that a name like moon dough does make the buyer expect a dough-like consistency, which this doesn't have.My biggest complaint is more with the animal molds.
The rooster and sheep almost always turned out nicely.
But, I found it almost impossible to get a good horse out of the mold.
The face was almost always somewhat smooshed and crumbly.
The cow only met with slightly better success.
That was with trying to stuff the mold as well as I could.
A 3-year-old (the low end of the suggested age range) wouldn't stand a chance.
My 5-year-old also had difficulty.
My 7-year-old had a difficulty level similar to mine, which means that a lot of attention paid to jamming in as much dough as possible yielded so-so results on 2 of the shapes.There's no label on the top of the mold, so as you turn the wheel, it's difficult to know which animal you're creating.
It wouldn't have been difficult to have the word ""cow"" written next to the mold opening.It's difficult to clean out the molds completely, so when you switch to a new color, you're likely to blend two colors of moon dough together.Because of how this product flakes, you will lose some amount of moon dough each time you play, unless you spend A LOT of time cleaning up.
"I've seen these products around for years but had always noted the generally poor reviews and stayed away.
How sad for us that we've gone so long without Moon Dough!
I will state first off, there are two brands of this type of ""dough"" which are usually lined up right next to each other in your local toy section.
Moon Dough and Moon Sand are NOT the same thing, even though the packaging and toy itself is very similar.
I have never bought Moon SAND, so I won't talk about that here, but it was the first of these types of toys to arrive on the market and the ones I have always seen with the poor reviews.Ok, so we've had Play-doh since my oldest son (5) was a toddler.
There's just something irresistible about gooey, colorful dough that kids can't seem to go without out.
We have quite a number of the little Play-doh sets, totaling a few hundreds dollars, I'm sure.
Though they always seemed really exciting at first, they always lead to inevitable disappointment and boredom when they can't make the items and creatures look like they do on the box.
It's too hard to get all those different colors to look right and even harder to just get the Play-Doh out of the molds most of the time.
Moon Dough doesn't pretend that your child can make all these detailed, multi-colored animals.
It shows you right on the box, these animals are one color and even your youngest child can make them without any help, and that's where the real fun is.
My son who normally gets bored/frustrated within 10 minutes of Play-Doh can play with Moon Dough for several hours, on and off throughout the day.
If I leave it on the kitchen table all day, he will absolutely return to it several times and play independently for long periods.Things I (as Mom) love about Moon Dough, it never dries out!
Literally.
We tried!
We left some Moon Dough out on the kitchen table the first week we had it just to see if it changed in any way.
"Moon Dough is of course a playdoh alternative.It supposedly doesn't dry out.
This is because it does not use moisture to make it soft and pliable.My wife played with this with my son for a while, and then my 7 and 8 year old joined in.Overall everyone had a good time.
A couple of points:1) You fill a mold from the top of the barn.
you really have to push the moon dough into the mold if you want some of the details of the critters to come out.
you are supposed to overfill the mold a bit and the top of the barn ""shaves off"" the excess which falls into the silo.2) You don't really know what animal you are making when you fill the mold.
you can guess when you look in the top.3) The playset is kinda cool, there is a mat that has grass printed on it, and the barn has a half-door that opens and closes and you can put a critter in it.4) The mold works as a two piece, and when you rotate the handle it opens at the bottom, the two halves split apart, and the critter falls out.
The molded shape got stuck once but it wasn't a big deal.
When you turn the handle more, the two halves come back together.5) There is a note on the barn that says ""turn the handle slowly, stopping at each position"".
In other words, turn the handle slowly.
The only one capable of doing this was my wife.
Which puts this in the category of ""an adult will be involved"" and for that reason it loses a star.6) The bags that the moon dough come in are very cheap.
I think they could have used some zipper lock bags and been nicer to everyone.
But its just a cheap heatsealed poly bag which you have to tear open, which means you don't get any way to store it.The amount of moon dough included was fair.
As is typical, they don't give you much more than they have to.Overall I thought it was a nice set and my kids liked it.
I don't think I'd buy it for my own kids, but it seems like a good item to give someone else's kids."
We love Moon Sand.
And I was so excited about the potential for this toy because:  A) my daughter gluten allergies which may be exacerbated by Play-doh, B) she LOVES all farm themed toys, C) we've had great fun with Moon Sand, and D) the stuff never dries out so it should last us forever, right?
Well, my daughter WAS very very excited when I showed her the box and she saw the barn.
We immediately took it outside to the porch on one of the last warm days of the season (which is also where we always play with our Moon Sand) and tore apart the box.The up side is that the toy was a cinch to assemble.
The down side was that, as other reviewers have commented, it was a crumbly mess!
You receive 3 packets of different colored Moon Dough which are VERY small, by the way.
The dough has a hard time sticking together and flakes off and sticks to clothing and carpeting.
It is also the sort of thing, once ground into the carpet, would be very hard to vacuum up.
Given how much the dough crumbles and falls apart everywhere, you'll find that 3 bags are hardly enough.Then, you're supposed to carefully put the dough into the mold at the top of the barn (and BTW, you can't really tell from the reverse molds which animal is going to pop out unless you scrutinize it carefully) and turn the crank SLOWLY (and this is clearly written on the instruction sticker) and out will come an animal down the chute.
The problems?
Well, find me a preschooler who is always going to have the patience to turn that crank slowly?
Every time we did it slightly too fast, only half the animal would come down the chute, the other half would remain stuck inside the barn!
And digging it out was a pain!!!
Because even when I poked at the half-animal, it would simply slide around instead of falling apart like a sand mold.
Then, when we did manage to get a full animal out of the chute, I would find that we didn't always perfectly fill the mold with the Moon Dough and that the sheep would be missing a nose or the chicken would be missing his whole head.
This is a problem you approach when playing with sand (whether at the beach or with Moon Sand), but it's particularly challenging here because you're filling the molds blind (i.e.
"I love the idea of the Moon Dough Magic Barnyard.
But the execution is just awful.
Assembly is simple: click on the ramp extender, the crank handle, and set the barn onto the base.
The animal molds make super cute animals (cow, sheep, pig, chicken) when you can get it to work.
But I hate the texture of the Moon Dough.
It has a powdery dry feel to it, and it crumbles even after squishing it together for a few minutes.
The warnings about the Moon Dough are a bit of a drawback too: Do not allow soap or liquid soap to contact the Moon Dough; Do not let the molds get wet.
Makes me very nervous...what happens if soap were to touch the dough?
Does a chemical reaction take place or what?
The instructions also say to not dispose of moon dough in the sink or toilet, again making me wonder what horrible things happen if moon dough gets wet.
Will the pipes clog or something?
There are also black box warnings that the moon dough should never get into the eyes or mouth, and that hands must be washed with liquid soap after playing with moon dough.While the toy says its for ages 3+, I would probably say more like 5+.
In order for the faces of the animals to be formed, you have to really jam the moon dough into the mold.
But often in the process of pushing the dough in, the mold wheel will start to move and can catch at fingers.
You also have to follow the instructions that say ""for best results turn crank slowly, pausing at each mold.""
This is very important because if you crank too fast, the animal only partially drops out of the mold at the ejection point and often will get cut in half.
This is an adorable crafting game.
Unfortunately, just like play dough, the molding clay dries up and then is unusable.
Hard to find replacements.
Right out of the box this moon dough looks kinda cool... the farm was easy to put together; and upon opening the moon dough my positive thoughts turned negative.
First, I like the fact it does not dry out llike playdough... but... it also falls apart and does not stay together which you can never make things/play with them, etc.
And kids will certanily be frustrated, specially special needs children like my son.
I also like the fact it is wheat free and hypoallergenic... so for somethis may just be the only option.However, besides not being pleased with the moon dough itself; I was not happy with the barn.
I popped in my moon dough into the mold hole on top, trying to tell what animal it was, I guessed a lamb mold but I'm still uncertain.
I winded the crank and out rolled away on the counter an... animal?
I think... it kinda resembled something, but for a child you certainly want to see an animal.
My second try the machine ate my animal and shredded the moon dough to pieces.. it never came out.
I tried one more time, fully disliking this product already; and my third animal did pop out, but again no clue on which animal it was.Between not knowing what I'm making and having the machine shred the dough I was not pleased.
I didn't let my child try this item because the moon dough falls apart so easily and is very messy.
From a sensory standpoint, the dough is very soft and fluffy.
In any case, I do not like the fact it falls apart and you can't make anything, let alone the troubles with the machine.
"The plastic barn that is used to create the animal shapes and hay bales seems durable enough for a cheap plastic toy.
My gripe isn't with the farm.
My gripe is with the moon dough itself.
My daughter's been wanting this for the longest time because it claims to ""Never Dry Out.""
I thought it would be like Play-Doh but just be cooler (i.e.
doesn't dry out but is still pliable like play-doh).
This is NOT the case AT ALL.
The texture is kind of powdery and is as light as paper.
The ""dough"" (if you want to call it that) doesn't even stick together and just breaks apart.
The dough was no fun for my kids and their friends and they immediately lost interest, whereas they can play with Play-Doh for at least an hour before getting bored.I have already thrown away the Moon Dough and we will attempt to squeeze regular Play-Doh through the farm's animal maker.
If that works, great, but if not we will be chucking the plastic farm as well.
Such a shame..."
"I got this for my son since I was interested in an alternative to play-dough.
The barn is attractive, he loves to turn the crank and especially likes it when the animals pop out at the bottom.
But the dough itself.... it's weird.It's like mushable foam, that's the only way I can describe it.
You don't have to worry about it drying out since it's already dry.
Very dry.
It keeps crumbling up and ""feathering"" away.
When we were done with our short session in which I did most of the handling of the dough, there were little flakes and crumbs EVERYWHERE.
And this is with ME mostly handling the dough.
(He played with it when the animals popped out.
)I had a hard time getting the silo to fit properly but it seems the fault is mine since my husband got it to fit nice and snug.The toy itself is pretty batter-proof.
It's dropped on the floor numerous times and my son is not gentle on that crank.
But I would be hesitant to take it out too often just because of the mess the dough makes.
Perhaps in the future I will try it with regular Play-dough and see how it goes."
Tons and tons of great fun.
You child can let his or her imagination run wild.
You just crank an mold all the animals and other figures.
Teaches your child how to use their imagination and how to make things.
Great toy with lots of fun.
I gave this to my 4 yr old niece and 6 year old nephew.
They had fun playing with it but their mom threatened to hurt me if I ever gave them anything like this again.
The mess!
Everything you have heard about how messy Moon Dough is well, it's all true!
This stuff was everywhere!!!
And then because it just falls apart everywhere my nephew tried to eat it something he has never done with playdough.
I would stick with playdough any day rather than this messy disaster waiting to happen.
If you don't mind a HUGE mess than this is a fun toy and molds well.... but the trade off just isn't worth it in my opinion.
I gave this toy to my 3 year old to play with.
He absolutely loved it.
This was the first time that we ever played with Moon Dough and I was amazed at its consistancy.
It is as light as air but when compressed into the molds it takes on the shape exactly.
My son had a hard time making the animals by himself so I helped him press the dough into the mold and turn the crank.
You put the dough in the top of the barn and then turn the crank until the animal spits out of the bottom.
We had a hard time with the other molds included (the hay bale and fence molds)because it was too hard to pop the dough out once it was in the mold.
Also, my son kept crushing the animals because they are extremely squishy and easily dent.
We probably played with this toy for over an hour and he had so much fun.
The problem that I had was the clean up.
Because the dough is as light as styrofoam and breaks off - it goes everywhere!
I was finding it on the kitchen floor for days after.
This will probably be an outdoor activity from now on.
My grandson actually jumped up and down and waved his arms when he saw this -- apparently kids have heard about this one.I was quite surprised to discover how easy this toy is to use.
Here's what it does: You put some new age playdough (called Moon Dough, various colors, which is very light, fluffy, nontoxic, and sticks to nothing) in the top of the barn (where there is a mold of your choice) and crank until the newly-formed object (a sheep, a bale of hay, etc.)
comes out the bottom.My grandson (age 3+) remains thrilled with this toy and he immediately gravitates to it when he visits.
It much better than the television as a babysitter and helps to develop manual articulation.
If you want to be a big hit on Christmas morning, grab one of these.This toy is very durable and I could not recommend it more highly.
"Moon Dough is educational in that it teaches kids that things are rarely as awesome in real life as they look in TV commercials.
My kids did a happy dance all over the house when they heard that the most heavily-advertised substance since Floam was on its way, but it didn't take long for them to come back down to earth.The ""toy"" consists of a plastic barn (which is easily assembled, no tools), a thin plastic mat about the size of a placemat, two molds (a hay bale mold and a fence mold) and three flat, non-resealable bags of Moon Dough in blue, white and yellow.
As other reviews have said, the dough is extremely crumbly and dry, and crumbs will scatter everywhere whether you like it or not.
So you might as well not fight nature, and either keep Moon Dough outdoors (as many parents do with Play-Doh and paint) or keep the dustbuster on standby.
Moon Dough has two advantages over Play-Doh: it doesn't dry out, and it doesn't stick to the floor or carpet (even when stepped on) and can be easily swept or vacuumed up.The disadvantage is that it's a lot less pliable than Play-Doh, thus harder to work with.
It's very hard to make freeform shapes because it doesn't stick to itself well.
It works better when you mold it or roll it out and stamp shapes with cutters.The box picture makes it look like you drop ""hay bales"" into the top of the barn to mold them into animals, but in fact you have to fill rather small molds with dough a little at a time, then really pack the dough down so that the animal will fall out at the bottom when the crank is turned.
I had to help my 6-year-old with packing, and after several days of her playing with it, the molds started to come apart slightly so that there was a ""seam"" on each animal.
The hay bale and fence molds are also hard for small children to work with; you have to give them a quick twist and shake to unmold them.
It didn't take long for all 3 colors of dough to blend into a sort of pukey green.
What's left of it, after I vacuum up the crumbs, I store in a Glad food container.My six-year-old has the most fun with this toy; my 8-year-old was quickly bored with it, but most kids that age have outgrown Play-Doh as well."
"""This keeps breaking!""
That's what we kept hearing from the kids when they started playing with the barnyard.The handle kept coming off with normal play, and it was frustrating us and the kids.When playing the kids need constant supervision to help fix the handle coming off.
""I can't get it out!""
They had trouble getting the hay bales out.The toy also doesn't come with any airtight containers for the moon dough.
You open the plastic bag to get the dough out, but you have to rip the bag to get it open, and where are you going to put the moon dough when you're done?
It really should come with little containers for the moon dough for storage.The moon dough itself is very soft, but like any other PlayDough, it makes a mess.
I don't know if I'd call the moon dough a lot better than regular playdough.
It's softer for sure, but it also crumbles a bit.In the short spurts that things worked right, the kids had fun, but it requires much too much supervision to keep it going when the handle comes off and the dough gets stuck."
"I was curious about Moon Dough.
I had read the reviews that said it was a lighter consistency than Play-Doh.
It is much lighter - about the consistency of foam.
I liked the fact that it is not supposed to dry out.
This set comes with 3 packages of Moon Dough.
I received white, blue, and yellow.
They come in non-reusable bags.
Even though it isn't supposed to dry out, I would think you need something to store it in.
I used a Ziploc sandwich bag, but it would have been nice if it had come in a reusable container.
The instructions say to work Moon Dough by 'squishing,squashing"" it in your hands.
I found it to crumble quite easily.
To try to avoid a mess, I put a small amount into the sandwich bag and squished and squashed it in that, similar to how I would mix the color through homemade dough.
It took a long time to get it to a consistency that would mold.There are some interesting things in the instructions.
It mentions in several places to not let the dough come in contact with soap, liquid soap, or water.
It also says to not dispose of the dough in the sink or toilet bowl.
I'm not sure what will happen if you do.
I received this item through the Amazon Vine Program.
I obtained it for my two year old son, whom loves farm animals very much, like most children would.
I understand that he's a year younger than the expected range for this toy, but it was something I could help him play with.
Snapping it together was pretty quick and painless, and we were really looking forward to pushing out some moon dough animals, but once we opend the moon dough, it crackled like sand and made a huge mess of my living room.
I don't know if I just got a bad one, or if moon dough is simply not as easy to use as it seems, but I really didn't get too far with this item.
We ended up tossing the dough and giving him the barn to play with, as he loves that part of it.
The barnyard idea is great.
Making barnyard shapes out of the dough is wonderful.
Using the Moon Dough is scary and messy.
The dough just feels weird, like it should be toxic and doesn't belong in your hands.
It leaves an odd residue or a feeling that there is a residue that can't be washed off with soap and water.
With the less than perfect way my kids wash their hands before they eat, I don't trust them to play with this toy.As for the functionality of the dough - it's difficult.
It needs to be warmed up and kneaded a bit for to supposedly work properly.
While attempting to do this, bits fall off everywhere.
I am unable to get it to the right consistency for it to come out of the molds in one piece.
The animals are left with half a head or three legs.
Perhaps I need to practice to improve my Moon Dough skills, but I just don't want to.
