Reviews:
My 8 year old has been testing this product for me.
So far it has survived a great deal of switching between the nozzles (the part I was most worried would break soon), being dropped from a treehouse and several frantic flights from an older sibling in a wet shirt.
I'm pleased with the toy's durability, my son's quite pleased with its water capacity and range.
I am a big Super Soaker fan.
I have found memories of catching my sister unawares with a soak barrage from across the yard.
I was hoping the Super Soaker Switch Shot Blaster would bring this experience to my kids.Well, my first impression was massively underwhelming.
The range on this Super Soaker is really limited compared to the models I had as a child.
Gone is the pump it up and then spray.
Instead, this model sprays while you pump.
No trigger here.
A pump is a shot.
Don't get me wrong, versus a standard squirt gun, the Switch Shot is king!
Once I realized my limitations my kids were soaked from head to toe.But those limitations really set my expectations low from that point on.The clip is a nice addition from the old day, however, you only get one in the box.
I really feel it should have come with 2 to show how cool multiple clips would be.The different spraying modes I could take or leave.
This has been done better in other models through out the years.
Just give me one good fine stream, long range setting and I'd be golden!Overall: 3 solid stars.
"This was too much fun!
When my son received this one and two others for Christmas they (son, daughter, and husband) couldn't wait until the weather warmed up enough to play with them.
Seriously- it was only 70 degrees out when they decided it was warm enough.
We filled a 20 gallon tub with water from the hose and everyone had the opportunity to re-fill their cartridge right at the bucket... if you dared.
I can see this water gun being even more fun with additional cartridges that could be filled and carried.
Through multiple unloading and reloading of the clip, the gun has held up and so have the pieces.
No chipping, jamming, or breaking to date (one month into water-gun fighting season).
Here's my 11 year old's view on it when I asked about the pro's and con'sPro's: You can select what kind of spray you want.
The head has a turn-able nozzle (like a hose sprayer for your garden) that lets you pick the action.
The clip gives you extra spraying time and cn be clipped to your belt if you have extras.Con's: There isn't a trigger, this is a pump-action only water gun.
Also, you get only ""three real shots"" of water without the cartridge clip, then you have to refill.
So don't lose your clip- especially to Dad.
- haha.On the whole they love this particular water gun over the others they own by Super Soaker for portability and number of shots given with the clip."
My husband and daughters love playing with water guns during the summer.
Of course living in Vegas we have a long season for water guns.
Most of ours only live the one summer before breaking from being used regularly or from being outside (in and out of the sun).
I'm interested to see how long this one survives.
This is one impressive water gun.
Just look at it.
It's cool.
However, it runs out of water pretty darn fast.
You can choose the type of stream/spray and it comes out pretty fast and far.
You really need to have extra clips if you don't want to constantly stop and refill.
We are typically playing in the pool when using water guns and have found that theMax Liquidator Eliminator (ONE)(colors may vary)is a better fit for us.
The super soaker user tends to get more wet since it is so much easier and faster to refill the other type of gun.
If you are looking for running around and playing water guns, this is a cool gun but will need extra clips or you'll always be refilling.
Can't wait for summer to really give this toy a workout.
Gave it to my son to try out in the shower.
He had a great time.
Holds a pretty good amount of water, and I have no doubt that he will have great fun with it this summer.
4 water shots to choose from.
Not sure who is more excited, me or my son.
Might have to order another.
Nerf products are always durable, so I am sure it will hold up well.
Water toys always a hit in our house.
Came well packaged, so no broken parts.
Easy to put together.
"Built tough to be played with, this soaker can be put together and/or apart under 5 seconds.The soaker is a good quality & fun toy and the grand-kids love it!The banana clip holds 2 1/2 cups of water & will shoot approx 30 shots with full distance power.Then 2-3 more shots, but those are lame.Four different shots can be selected.1.
Jetstream, * one round stream, shoots 30 to 35 ft.2.
Triple shot, *** three round streams, shoots 25 ft.the inside & out-side streams are 3 ft apart with one in the center.3.
Scatershot, -:- 5 streams, 3 center streams shoot 25 ft.with 2 outside streams 22 ft, covers 5 ft wide.4.
Atomizer, --- fan shot 20 ft. & 6 ft wideNo water leaks out, you can lay the filled soaker down and it won't leak on any thingThe total length with the stock is 25"" and 15 1/2"" with-out stockThe soaker could be used just fine with-out the stock,perhaps for a smaller child but it's not near as accurate.Intended for 6 yrs.
and up.When we received the Super Soaker we had just had a fresh snowfallwhich was handy to see where the water landed for accurate measurements."
I'll have to admit, I like this latest Super Soaker for one reason but dislike it for another.
I have a few Super Soaker Thunderstorms (Super Soaker Thunderstorm), so seeing this is very interesting.
This version has a much bigger clip for holding water, which is a major plus, but it is manual pump, as opposed to the Thunderstorm's battery operated version.
By itself, that's not a big deal, but I like to hold a gun in each hand, and I can't do that if I have to pump.What I'll probably do is swap out the clip and use it on my Thunderstorm, and then hand this gun to my kids or friends.Overall, I like this gun's design.
Recommended for a water-gun loving kid, but I'd rate this a 5 star if they can make a battery operated model.
first off, this claims to shoot water 25 feet.
that's not accurate.
it wouldn't even make it halfway down my driveway no matter how much you pumped this sucker.
the stream wasn't weak though so my son still had fun with it.
it's VERY durable and has taken a lot of abuse being dropped from a tree house and thrown around at the beach.
my son loves the look and shape of it too and that it's not too bulky or heavy.
We've owned lots of water guns over the years.
My kids especially enjoy the big monster ones that you can do extra pumps to make more water come out harder and further (but are cumberson to run with).
This gun does not do that, but is smaller and easier to run around with.
It is a one pump (no trigger) and shoot (no extra pumps for extra velocity).
It holds enough water to get about 30 good shots before it needs to be refilled.
This water gun is no better and no worse than similar guns in this price range.
It is a fun toy and great gift idea for the upcoming summer.
"When I got the chance to review the Switch Shot I decided to give it a thorough testing.
First came my husband - who immediately said that it was going to be HIS new toy.
Then my 12 year old who had absolutely no problem loading it and firing it.
My 8 year old daughter was the next up - with the back piece off she was able to squirt the super soaker as well, which sort of surprised me as she usually has a difficult time doing so.
My cousin came over a few days later with her 5 year old daughter, so I gave her a shot with it.
She had a hard time loading the clip, but once I'd loaded it for her she managed to squirt her mother!
(Bonus for me LOL).
A week later my other cousin came over with her 3 year old and I thought ""what the heck, let's let HER give it a try"".
It was a tiny bit heavy for her (she's almost 4) but once she got a handle on it even SHE was able to squirt people!THAT makes me love this super soaker - the fact that anyone can use it, from a 3 year old to an almost 40 year old.
And the great thing is that we all loved playing with it!
It's definitely going to be THE gun we all fight over this summer when the weather gets hot!"
Turn the poolside into battlefield.
If your child's summer dreams run along this line, this is a perfect toy for you.
No one will be able to lounge peacefully with a book.
This is a monster water toy that leaves up to all it promises.
A perfect active child pool toy.
