Leap Pad connecting to computer problems HELP I am having problems with connecting my leap pad to my computer. I have downloaded LeapFrog connect and tried to reinstall it as well. LeapFrog connect works as I have used it for other leap frog products. Also changed my firewall settings. Once I turn on the leap pad and connect it to the computer, I get an error on the leap frog connect stating unable to connect. Anybody have any solutions? I really want it all ready to go for my daughter to open up on Christmas morning
Top sentence(s):
When we first received our tablet, there's no question that we were super impressed with it.
With her frustration level it helps to focus on the positives of what she is doing well and thus she feels more confident with the challenging questions.This was a great aid for several long car trips we were on with her.
All of them have grown up using the leapster that our oldest son received when he was 3..it has given out after a lot of use.
She uses it about half an hour a day and the first set of batteries lasted almost a month.
The timing couldn't have been better because it showed up just in time for my daughter's third birthday.Since then it's been amazing to see how it has held her interest as she has learned what it can do and how to do it.

Questions:
Parent Account on LeapPad On the Explorer there is a way to access the parent account / settings by pushing the ? button and the left pad. Has anyone been able to access this on the Leappad?  My children created a 3rd profile which I have not been able to figure out how to delete.   ???
Best apps and games for the LeapPad? I have purchased the LeapPad and cartridges weeks before Black Friday, but I am unsure which apps to choose from for a soon-to-be four year old boy. I am particularly interested in sections: games, learning videos and ultra ebooks, please all other recommendations are also welcome.Thanks in advance for your help. :)LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer Learning Tablet (Green)
Do the explorer games we already own work on the leap pad? From what I've read, all the leapster explorer game cartridges are interchangeable with the leappad.  That made me think I wanted to buy the leappad for my son for Christmas. However, I was in a store yesterday and saw that the games are marked either "explorer only" or "leappad and explorer".  So, now I'm wondering if the games I already own (bought within the past year) really won't work in the leappad.  For example, we own Mr. Pencil for the explorer.  So, will that cartridge automaticlaly work in the leappad or will I have to buy Mr. Pencil again? Can someone please clear this up for me?
Leap Pad connecting to computer problems HELP I am having problems with connecting my leap pad to my computer. I have downloaded LeapFrog connect and tried to reinstall it as well. LeapFrog connect works as I have used it for other leap frog products. Also changed my firewall settings. Once I turn on the leap pad and connect it to the computer, I get an error on the leap frog connect stating unable to connect. Anybody have any solutions? I really want it all ready to go for my daughter to open up on Christmas morning
Kindle Fire instead of LeapPad for 5 1/2 year old? LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer Learning Tablet (Pink)I'm in the market for a tablet for my 5 1/2 year old and 2 year old-both of whom are whizzes with my iPad 2.  I'm looking at the Kindle Fire and the almost endless apps/books/movies/songs, rechargeable battery and price of only $199. It sure seems like a much better value than the LeapPad.  Has anyone purchased the Kindle Fire for use by a child?  How does it compare to an iPad 2?  Thanks!
Syncing apps to the leappad Bought my kids the leappad explorer for Christmas.  First, it took 45 minutes to download the software I need.  I am not having MAJOR problems and frustrations with syncing the apps.I downloaded the 4 apps that came with the leappad.  2 of them will not sync.  I try to click on the check box next to the app in the 'On this leappad' page, but it just won't check.  It continues to say "Not on Leappad".  I uncheck/check the ones that seem to work but cannot get the Art studio and story studio to sync.  What gives?  What am I doing wrong or is this a malfunction.  It won't work on either of the 2 leappads I have.Please give me guidance, anyone else have this issue??
Freezing up My daughter's leappad seems to be working fine until we play the Bubble Guppies App. It's here favorite and whenever she plays the video, halfway through it freezes completely up (screen goes clear) and we have to take the batteries out to turn it off. Does anyone else have this problem or is it just ours?
If I buy two tablets, can I buy one game and put it on both or do I have to pay for two games? I am doing research on this for my 3 and 5 year olds.  I am thinking about getting two and am wondering what I would need to spend on game/book apps right away.  Also, if I but one game, can I place it on both tablets or do I have to pay for it twice?
Can you load 1 game on 2 leapPads? I have 2 leappads for my daughters.  Can you buy the app once and download it onto each one?  And how do you do it?
Is 8 years old too old for Leappad?? My son just turned 8 years old, Those of you that have these in your homes, what do you think?? Is he too old or does the Leappad still have apps and games that he would be interested in?
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
"We have always been a fan of LeapFrog and our kids have gotten a lot of use out of their Leapster Explorers.
The games are hit and miss, like most video games, but all in all pretty decent.The LeapPad was not a purchase, but an Amazon Vine acquisition, in full disclosure.
Still, we like it, and it has all but replaced the older Leapster Explorer in our routine (we also recently got a GS, read below).PROS+ Bigger screen (5"") is awesome+ Sleeker design, easier to hold+ Integrated, built in camera, video recorder & microphone are fantastic; built in game shows off its capabilities (Pet Pad)+ Cartridges from Explorer work (backwards compatible)+ Don't think the screen is any better resolution, but bigger is better+ Better battery life (but see the con below)Cons:- want the LeapPad 2, as it has all the great built-in games like the GS- Wish it was rechargeable... thinking of switching to rechargeable batteries.- Computer connection is very unreliable, but you can still use it without getting the connecton to work (I have an email into support about that)My kids have been playing with our new Leapster Explorer GS and our LeapPad all day.
Clearly, they do a good job of entertaining even a 7 and 5 year old, which I would have considered the upper end of appeal for these machines.DISCLOSURE: My kids are now 5 and 7, and full disclosure, I'm not sure we would have bought the LeapPad and Leapster Explorer GS.
I did recently select them via Amazon Vine; now, having tried them, they are significant upgrades on the products they replace (built in camera vs. bulky add on camera that has to come on and off, better battery life, sleeker forms, built in games, etc.)"
We've owned our LeapPad Tablet for more than 3 months now.
When we first received our tablet, there's no question that we were super impressed with it.
It's very sturdy, the screen is big and bright, it's generally intuitive and simple to use, and, well, what kid doesn't want a tablet computer?
My 5-year old daughter was thrilled, and my 9 year-old son was suitably jealous.
Unfortunately, in the long run, none of us has been completely happy with our LeapPad.Buying LeapFrog apps has been a frustrating experience.
I couldn't find customer reviews for apps on LeapFrog's site, and without the guidance of others, we ended up spending a lot of money on apps that just weren't for us.
My daughter loved Jewel Train 1 & 2 and Roly Poly Picnic when we first got them, but they don't have much depth to them, and she only played them for a few days before she was entirely done.
The extremely expensive Cinderella and Cars Ultra eBooks were a huge disappointment... worth reading and playing around with a couple of times but definitely not worth $25 each.
In the end, after loading almost $100 worth of apps to our tablet, the only ones that my daughter regularly uses are the free Art Studio and Pet Pad apps that came with the tablet.
Very disappointing.After our bad app experiences, we decided to try a LeapFrog Explorer cartridge game.
We bought the newLeapFrog Explorer Learning Game: SpongeBob SquarePants: The Clam Prix (works with LeapPad & Leapster Explorer)game, which has gotten great reviews here on Amazon from Leapster Explorer owners and looks like a really great game.
But it is just so hard to play on the Leappad Tablet!
It's hard to explain, but to drive SpongeBob's car around the track, you have to turn the Leappad sideways, and use the one large button on the edge of the Leappad to steer your car while pushing fake A and B buttons on the other side of the touchscreen to press the gas and answer questions.
My 5 year-old's fingers - which can manage a computer mouse, a Wii controller, and a Nintendo DS just fine - simply can't hold the LeapPad and reach everything she needs to drive the car successfully.
I, a lifetime gamer of 36 years, can just barely manage to do it.
Obviously, the LeapFrog Explorer cartridge games were designed with the Leapster Explorer's controls in mind.
Parents today have a great buffet of electronic toys to choose from, and I would put this near the top of the list, especially for that creative budding tech kid in your life.There are so many features, it is hard to know where to start.There is a camera / video recording device so your junior Francis Ford Coppola can start shooting their own movie or your Ansel Adams can begin work on their portfolio.
The pictures and video can be incorporated into Story Studio (My Book About Me) module.
Your budding Andy Warhol isn't left out; he/she can get their art on in the Art Studio.
Books (teaching to read and interactive) can be downloaded from the LeapPad store online.
There are also numerous games for a wide range of skill levels too.One really neat feature is that pictures, video, artwork, game scores, and all other learning data can be uploaded to the internet for sharing with other family members.
I did not explore the safety of sending this data out, but I believe it is in the form of an email to each person you designate.The one downside, the 'apps' (as we adults term them) cost additional money, and kids get a LeapPad form of advertising promoting the new products.
Make sure you preview or check out each app before buying to make certain you want to invest.
Prices when I last checked ranged between $7.50 - $15.00 for most.
Some of the books, I will not say which, needed some refining in my opinion.
I tend to be strict when it comes to stories; I like clear messages of action and consequence.Do not be looking for iPad speed with the CPU; the manufacturer explained to the Vine group that they use a slower processor to keep the costs down.
It doesn't affect the play; it just affects the loading of the apps.
The unit is a bit heavy too, so either your child will tire of long term play or have really strong forearms.I suggest having a needle or pin available to help attach the stylus on the lanyard.We are approaching the holiday season...and I strongly suggest buy now if you are leaning towards this item.
It is that good.
"I received a LeapPad from LeapFrog over a month ago and wanted to ""live with it"" for a bit before posting a review.
The timing couldn't have been better because it showed up just in time for my daughter's third birthday.Since then it's been amazing to see how it has held her interest as she has learned what it can do and how to do it.
She's the kind of child who likes to do and learn things on her own.
This toy is built so it explains things as you go; the more she does the more that is explained.
For her, at least, part of the fun is learning how to use it.The display is large and clear.
The tablet is light without feeling (or being) flimsy.
The graphics and instructions are clear and presented in a friendly and expressive manner.How educational is it?
Hard to say with a three year old.
All I know is she can do a lot more with the tablet ""on purpose"" than she could four weeks ago and the only way she has learned that is from the tablet.
That includes everything from learning to follow instructions to developing fine motor skills.
For someone her age learning those skills seems dead on.
And, since getting it she's asking to play games on my iPhone far less often.Battery life is good for a device of this kind.
She uses it about half an hour a day and the first set of batteries lasted almost a month.
We were driving some place and she was in the back playing with the tablet.
I heard it say, ""Please change the batteries"" (or something like that) every five minutes or so.
Not so often as to be annoying but often enough that it was noticed.
We are just getting started with this, but my 7 year old daughter loves the Leap Pad thus far, so much so that we're already having to enforce time limits on her use of it.
All of the apps appear to be user friendly and intuitive for a child, and all or most seem to have some educational or creative value.
I like it that she's on there reading books, playing spelling games, doing art projects, etc.
And she seems to love everything about it, so it's a win-win.
Recommended.
"FIRST AND FORMOST: The only place we could find this item before Christmas was on leadfrog's website and we had to buy a bundle to get it.
If you are having trouble finding a leappad, keep checking their website as I spoke to a rep and they said they should have more soon.I will give my initial impressions and tell you what our expectations are for this toy.
When my daughter gets it for Christmas I will update this review with her impressions and post future updates to provide more info and review details on durability and use.We have 3 kids (2 year old boy, 4 year old girl, and 7 year boy).
All of them have grown up using the leapster that our oldest son received when he was 3..it has given out after a lot of use.
They all are comfortable with using the leapster, iphone/ipod touch, and the computer, so our expectations are that they will be able to utilize the leappad quickly.We bought the LeapPad for our 4 and a half year old daughter.
She is in pre-school now and will be going to kindergarten in the fall of 2012.
She had a lot of trouble learning letters and phonics until this past summer when things began to click, but there is a lot of room for improvement.
We hope she will be able to read simple books by the end of next summer (just before kindergarten).
She handles math concepts well for her age and is very creative.
We expect that this toy will excite, encourage, and motivate her to make more strides (with our involvement and direction) as much as the original leapster did in the following areas:SpellingWriting SkillsReading SkillsMath and Logic SkillsDrawing SkillsBasic Camera and Video SkillsI expect this toy to last as long as the original leapster did (at least 4 years) and to be handed down to our 2 year old in 2-3 years.I am also excited to see how it tracks my daughters ""learning path"" over time.
Hopefully it has some useful information.Packaging was okay...It was shipped in larger box which was not filled very well.
When delivered the leappad and games in the box were bouncing around.
I can only imagine how much bouncing they did between Canada and South Carolina.
However, everything got here safe and appears to be working well.What came in the box:- 2 styluses - both are magnetic and one included a string to attach to the leappad.
I like the magnetic stylus idea, but the string attachment was a nice touch to help to ensure we don't lose the stylus.- CD for installing the leappad connect.
You can also download this software for free from the leappad site.- USB cable for downloading/installing games with leappad connect.
This is a great product!
Our family is not too much into everything having to be electronic.
I much prefer to nurture the love of books and thinking.
That being said, this LeapPad is a great toy.It is as durable as it claims.
It has a nice big screen that can be used horizontally or vertically.
Each of my kids can customize their own file.
It has a built-in camera, an art section, buit-in games, and other games and tutorials are available for purchase.Kids can customize and take care of a pet.
There is an art section, storybooks, letter practice, leapfrog movies and more!
I haven't even downloaded any extras yet, and my kids have tons of fun playing on this device.
Even my two-year-old can navigate through the menus.You can buy more games in the store (LeapExplorer), as well as get an App Center Download card where you can choose from what they offer online.
The games are fun and educational.
The quality is consistent with Leapfrog.
We are all very happy with this device and my kids think they have a cool iPad like their aunt.
This tablet is one of the most wished for Christmas items last year for good reason.
You can do so much with this nifty little device.It has a built it camera that allows you to take photo and video and save them on the device.
The picture and video is a little grainy but not bad at all for this type of device.
Our kids like using it for pictures and video and it's very easy for small kids to use.
It's made solid enough that I trust young kids to walk around playing with it and occasionally dropping it or banging it against something without it getting broke.The first time that you plug it in to your pc and register then you can download a few games, e-books and videos.
After that you will have to purchase additional software.
It's very easy to purchase new software and download it to the tablet but the cost can be a little high for what you get.
However some of the software goes on sale and you can get it at a much better deal from time to time.
We normally wait for the sales because I think the games are much more expensive than they really should be.
I could buy a Blu-ray movie for the cost of some of their 25 minute videos.
My guess is once this tablet loses some of its popularity then they might lower the cost for games and other apps like e-books and videos.This tablet is great to keep your kids busy during a long car or airplane trip or just playing at home.
Many of the games have educational value which is always a plus.
Kids learn much better when you make learning fun and the LeapPad is fun and teaches at the same time.
I love the design of this tablet I would just like to see more free apps included in the cost of the device and lower cost for other apps that you purchase.
"My experience with and appreciation for LeapFrog devices started over 10 years ago with the original LeapPad and has continued though the Leapster, Clickstart Computer and Leapster2.
What impresses me about the company is that it continues to evolve and expand its products in a manner that allows children to keep pace with the tools and technology they see their older siblings and parents using.
The LeapPad Explorer is the latest release from LeapFrog and it arguably may be the most impressive product the company has delivered since the original LeapPad.With the growing popularity of tablet devices and all the neat things they can do, it was inevitable that a tablet for kids would be on its way.
But, once a child has seen the ""real deal"", the biggest challenge may be whether or not a tablet aimed at kids could actually meet graphic and entertainment expectations ... not to mention the ability to expand and meet the educational and entertainment demands parents want for a growing child.
Another more practical concern would be whether or not it was built to endure the often destructive environment of a child between the ages of 4 and 9 years old.
The LeapPad both addressed and exceeded all of my expectations and more importantly, my daughter's finicky demands.Some of the features of the LeapPad tablet include:- Fully functional 5-inch touch-screen with a high resolution ... a stylus that can be tethered to the tablet and a backup stylus.- Motion-based technology (including gyroscopic ability) for more active game play.- Built-in camera and video (with audio) ... the resolution quality greatly exceeded expectations.
The graphics totally enhance the e-read capability of the tablet by creating an immersive and color-rich environment that will greatly appeal to both parents and kids.- The software and setup procedure for an online account is easy and painless.
The 2 GB of memory should provide plenty of room for pictures, videos, saved projects ... and, of course, all the add-ons that will be purchased.The LeapPad Explorer tablet comes with some pre-loaded goodies that allow a child to customize the device to suit them, including an ""all about me"" application that incorporates the tablet's drawing, photo and video capabilities to create an autobiography.
Even though the pre-loaded applications should keep most children occupied for quite a while, the multitude of varied add-on applications (directly downloaded or cartridge) will likely be too tantalizing to ignore ... be prepared to open the wallet.
The add-on applications cater to a variety of skills including creativity, flash cards, reading, math, science, games and videos.
Familiar faces like Dora, Thomas the Train, Cars and Disney Princesses will easily lure kids to wanting these educational add-ons.
Those who already own a Leapster Explorer will appreciate that their game cartridges are compatible with the Explorer tablet (the Leapster2 cartridges are NOT compatible with the LeapPad tablet).While designed as a tablet for kids as young as 4 years old, I don't necessarily classify the device as a ""toy"" and some common-sense care is required to ensure its life expectancy lasts more than a week.
With that being said, the LeapPad's plastic housing and touch-screen is rugged enough to take some moderate indoor kid abuse like accidental dropping, but it might be wise for a parent to protect their investment with an after-market protective storage case and/or protective sleeve that LeapFrog has designed specifically for the LeapPad.This is probably the most impressive child-oriented learning tool that I have seen to date.
The LeapPad is great for both parents and kids in that it has the potential to be a long-lasting learning tool (provided LeapFrog keeps building on it and provides a steady flow of new add-ons).
The tablet has an addictive quality that should easily steer kids away from the television ... yes, it's THAT good.
Now, if only LeapFrog could develop a device to make kids like vegetables."
Got this for my 4 year old grandson.
He quickly was able to figure out how to use it and plays with it every time he comes over.
I've reviewed the material on the tablet and find it a good education level for him also.
I would recommend this to others.
"This a a nice, more durable alternative to an ipad for your kids.
It is much slower than an ipad and kids that are towards the upper age range of this toy won't be fooled.
The camera was neat addition.
The downsides are definitely the ""apps"", they are pretty pricey.
I really hate that in order to update and purchase apps you have to plug into the computer.
Every single tech piece that is in our home has wifi, so it is a major pain to have to plug this one in.
I am sure that won't bother most people, but for me it is a deal breaker.
I would rather scrape together a little more cash and purchase a 1st gen or used ipad.
Rechargeable batteries are also important, I can't believe that this toy doesn't even plug in to recharge, bummer."
My 2 kids - a 14 yr old and 6 months old - are too old and too young for the LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer Learning Tablet so the task of tinkering with this fell on my 5-year old niece where I will be basing my review.
This is way cooler and more advanced than the Leap pad I bought my oldest daughter when she was still young.
Now, everything is interactive where learning can be more direct and visualized.
This is directed for kids 4-9 years of age.
So you can be rest assured that your child will not outgrow this in an instant.
When this arrived in the mail, my niece was head over heels in excitement and we both opened the box and here are my first impressions:It's shape and functionality is now like a PC Tablet.
In fact IT IS a PC Tablet meant for kids.It has a built-in camera and video recorder.The 5-inch screen with a 480x 272 resolution is amazingly sharp, the screen displays images and videos in superb clarity.It is touch-screen and comes with its own stylus.
This is a great way to introduce kids to anything that is touch-screen.The size is just right for kids.
My niece's with her small hands held it perfectly and it is very light.It comes with a standard built-in 2GB of memory which is a great starting capacity when they take their photos and videos.
Since resolution is not that high, they can take a lot of pictures and the 2GB memory can store it comfortably.Comes bundled with appsDespite geared for kids, it still needs adult intervention to load the apps since you will be connecting this via USB in your computer and make your child familiar with the controls.
I know for a fact how this will enhance a child's learning as I have seen it with my own daughter when she was growing up with the old LeapPad.
With the optional apps, games and accessories, the possibilities for this becomes long.
I as an adult truly enjoyed introducing this to my 5-year old niece.
Now she doesn't even want to let go of it!
Extremely highly recommended!
LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer Learning Tablet is a neat electronic learning toy/tablet that the kids will enjoy.
The tablet comes with a stylus, a USB cord and a disc .
Inside, you'll be able to add three profiles and it comes with a couple of games, an e-book, batteries (which were already inside when I tried it) a video camera and a few other interesting apps.
In the future you can also download other software and the add on cartridges.The tablet uses 4 AA batteries (for longer play you should get some lithium ones).
It's easy to hold and the bright colors, cute images and versatile usability makes this a must have for kids who are interested in having fun whilst learning.
If you're looking for an educational tool for your child then I suggest that you take a look at this learning tablet.
There's even a headphone jack, an extra stylus and a place to put an AC adapter (in case you're at home at don't want to drain the batteries).The software is compatible with new Mac models and PCs.
Highly recommended for those with children who need to add some education in their lives.
My 7 year-old daughter is at the upper end of usage for this product but it has been great for her none-the-less.
We have had a Leapster and a LeapFrog book reader before.
The Leapster was a little quirky, was very heavy and had some bugs in the software.
The book version was never a big hit with my kids and we preferred to just sit and read books together.The LeapPad Explorer has taken their past products and make them very current, high educational value and high quality.The first thing I noticed is that the LeapPad has a great feel to it.
Very smooth finish, sleek edges, easy to reach buttons and a stylus that feels more like other popular game styluses.
The screen is very clear, bright, and the colors are vibrant so visually, it is very attractive.The operating system is easy to use and offers parental access to manage user accounts and other features.
There is built-in software and games that provide a variety of things to do, whether they are true learning games or puzzle type games.
There are some limits as to the kinds of games available but they seem to be adding to the list all the time.To get the best use of the product, you will need to invest in more games to download to the LeapPad Explorer.
It will get fairly repetitive if you don't.The batteries were the only drawback for two reasons: they are difficult to get in and out; and they are used up fairly quickly so I would recommend getting a couple sets of rechargeable batteries.This is an investment but it seems to be one that is well thought out and has a lot of room for growth.
I got this toy to have available when my friends bring their older children over to my house (my son is a little too young for this right now).
My friend brought her almost 3-year-old over and she was the first to play with it.
I was amazed at how quickly she was able to pick it up and go with it.
She went right for the videos (not sure how she knew to pick those applications) and sat down and watched the ABC video.
She needed a little more help with some of the other applications, but with some guidance was then able to get through them on her own.
It entertained her for 3 hours!
She would have kept playing, but it was time for her to go home.I took it right out of the box and started it up without any updating.
I did not connect it up to my computer to check for updates since my friend's daughter was anxious to get playing.
It was all ready to go as-is.Pros:Easy for kids to pick up on the applications and play with it right away.Lots of good, educational applicationsrugged toy that was dropped several times (including by me right out of the package)entertaining for hoursCons:Slow.
For a 2-year-old that is impatient some of the applications took a little longer to load and she didn't want to wait and kept turning it off thinking it was already off (the screen was black during loading)The stylus is hard to attach!
Oh my goodness, I could not get the string to go into the holes to attach to the leap pad.
My friend wasn't able to get it either.
The 2-year-old hated the string hanging from it, but without the string, it would have been lost (she stuck it in her shoe at one point and I saw the string hanging from her shoe).Applications can be expensive.
At $10 each, it can add up.Overall, this is an entertaining toy even for the younger, tech savvy kids.
The LeapPad Learning Tablet, is very nice for children that can't get enough of electronic devices.
However, I was a little disappointed that it still required CD installation to set up the device.
I expected the device to be totally web based with downloads.
Once you get past this inconvenient step, the device works great.
My son does enjoy playing the games, and loves the camera feature.
I would however recommend using the lower end of the age recommendation suggestion (5  - 8).
My son is eight and he is a little more advanced for this device.
I do however recommend this device for those with younger children.
Unlike many of the people on here, I didn't necessarily get this for my kids (God kids) so they could learn.
I know that sounds silly, but it reminds me of a fancier version of the toys I had growing up that were like this that had a few games on them and you could play on road trips.My kids love this toy and that's all I care about it, they enjoy the games, especially the Blues Clues ones, and the two of them love it so much they sometimes get in to tussles...I like that it has a camera on it, that way they don't have a reason to use mine...It works well, haven't had any issues with it, the battery life is decent, though it would be nice to be able to extend it, but its fine enough for home use and trips to the store without having to bring extra batteries.
:)That's all.EDIT Thurs July 26, 2012:  My God sons are still loving this, especially the two year old, he loves to curl up in his daddy's lap and play on it.
:)EDIT THURS FEBRUARY 7, 2013:  My God sons still love the Leap Pad after over a year!
They haven't bought any new games on it since they got it and they are not even remotely bored with it.The great thing about the Leap Pad is it is EXTREMELY durable.
My God Sons broke 5 Nooks and many many phones, but they have kicked, stepped on, and thrown the Leap Pad and it still works just the same as it did the day it was purchased.This is worth the price of the leap pad for its durability alone.
Yes, the games are a little spendy, but no more than buying a standard video game, and sometimes you can get them on a good sale on Amazon or Kmart.
:DGod Bless ~Amy
The Leapfrog Leappad is certainly a new favorite for my kids.
Leap Frog has always come out with fun and educational tiys in the past and this is no exception.
It already comes with a few games and more games can be bought and downloaded from their app store.
With people already familiar with the apple store, this is a fairly easy concept to get used to.
The game itself is very sturdy and feels like a good quality product.
The apps are a bit expensive but as I said, we're used to it these days.
I would highly recommend this excellent educational and fun toy for our kids!
The nice surprises:- came with $40 in cards to download more content- Came with batteries (despite the fact that it clearly states it comes without them)The bad:- battery life is mediocre- Everything is based on a stylus (a simple touchscreen would have been wonderful and easier for children to use)- Sound is relatively loud, even in the lowest setting (not a good choice for reading at night - you can hear the sounds in the living room)- Apps are expensive (you would think $40 would be you a bit, but it's just enough for 2 interactive books, or 5 regular books (which are about 12-20 pages long, each with about 20 -25 words).Interactive book = $20Regular book = $7.50 - $10 (as of Oct, 2011)To be honest, the interactive books are probably a better value, since you get at least double the content and your child participates in the story; these might be good for children who don't like to read much.
They get nice transitions, sound, and some input in the story.Not sure I can call it educational - but I'll withhold judgement on that until later.
My granddaughter who just started first grade this year loves this toy.She has not been exposed to a lot of electronic media so I worried how quickly she would catch on to how to use this -- however no worries.
She explored on her own and slow built up to using more and more features of this toy.She would use the video camera to tell stories (great tool for developing story telling abilities).
She also used it in a journal fashion to talk about and share emotions.
(these are all things she developed independently)With some of the learning games she would become frustrated and just guess at an answer until she was able to move to the next level.
(leave it to a child to find ways around learning activities)  However with time she became more familiar with the learning activities and spent more of a focus on getting the answer right.I like how when I connect it to my computer I can get a sense of what she is struggling with and what is easier for her.
With her frustration level it helps to focus on the positives of what she is doing well and thus she feels more confident with the challenging questions.This was a great aid for several long car trips we were on with her.
She was engaged in playing the games or creating videos.
It kept her occupied and was much more engaging than just watching a movie.
"The Leap Pad was an unexpected gift to my five year old son.
Every since it came in the mail he has wanted to play it non-stop!
It is fun and the games are educational.
Currently, his favorite game is ""Stretchy Monkey 2"".
I like how you can download a new game so easily and I feel that the downloads are cheaper than buying a new Leapster Game in the store.
I also like how the Leap Pad can play games that also play on the Leapster Explorer, that way, if you upgrade from the Explorer, you can still use those games.
I also wanted to mention that I gave this game 5 stars for durability because our Leap Pad was left out in a thunderstorm and we were shocked that it still worked!
The Leap Pad is another quality product made by Leap Frog.Edit: One thing you should know about this product is that it consumes batteries rather rapidly.
Make sure you have a good supply of AA rechargeable batteries to keep it running!"
I was a little hesitant to get this for my 3 &  year old, as the device is recommended for ages 4 and up, but as long as there is an adult to supervise and assist with a few things here and there while my daughter is using this, she has no problems and has lots of fun with it.This is a nice, sturdy, well-built device, solid and heavy in your hands - I was not afraid when I handed this to my daughter that it would instantly break if she were to drop it.
She understands though that she has to be very careful with it and only use it when sitting down.From the very beginning the system is very easy to use and navigate and has so many fun options, features and games and things you can customize.
Within less than 15 minutes we had customized a pet, taken a few pictures and played around with them, and customized some art work.
My daughter had no problem maneuvering through the system and quickly remembered what buttons had what functions, and where to go for certain things.The device comes with 2 stylus pens to use - 1 has a tether to keep it attached to the device which I highly recommend using.
How they expect young kids not to lose one that isn't attached I don't know.
Even though they provide the stylus both my daughter and I found that for many of the applications we simply preferred to use our finger to manipulate the choices and options on the screen - for little fingers this is a perfect option and often much easier than trying to use the stylus.While the 5-inch touch screen may sound very tiny to an adult used to larger devices with larger screens, it really is perfect for kids.There are many cool features  on the LeapPad:*Kids artwork and videos can be uploaded to a computer to share with others.
*Kids can record their own voices reading the stories that are on the device.
*The LeapPad automatically adjusts to your child's level of learning as they use the various programs, and parents can track this online.
*Most of the categories are voice-guided, so even if your child can't read yet or can't read well they will have no problem enjoying the games and creative applications.
*The LeapPad is compatible with all of the Leapster Explorer games and apps, providing an enormous array of choices for games and learning materials.The few things I don't like about the LeapPad:*It's a battery monster - I wish that it came with a charger or rechargeable batteries.
*The apps and games are rather pricey - I'm hoping the prices will drop a bit over time.Overall we really like the LeapPad -for a child's toy I think it's a great product and we'll enjoy it for many years.
Leapfrog makes wonderful, well received computer teaching systems for children.
This latest tablet version is just wonderful.
Got the green one-it's great.
Really good looking.When is a child ready for this?
The recommendation is to start at age 4 years.
That depends on your child and you.
Started an 18 month old on this system to see how she'd do.
Mom is extremely computer literate and the parents play on this leapfrog together with their child.
The little girl wants to play with this everyday-she just loves it.
By 4, she'll probably master this on her own quickly and be ready for the next step.Anyway, this is a great little toy/learning device.
Great Christmas gift for that special little someone!
My daughter loves the camera and video camera in this toy.There is an About Me sections where they can take pictures of things they like and include photos of their Family members.
My 6 year old had a great time walking around the house and taking photos.
She also love that she could play around with the photos by distorting them and placing stamps onto the as well as writing on the photos.She received a couple games as gifts along with a $20 App Card.
I found two $10 games on-line that I could download for her.
It was very easy to install, it took about 10 minutes to download them and upload to the devise.My daughter has dropped this on our wood floors twice and off the bed and it has held up.
I wish the games were not so expensive.
Around $25.00 for a cartridge and $7.50 - $25.00 on-line for the apps.
There are probably around 50 apps on-line to choose from.Rechargeable batteries are a MUST with this toy.
"My main assistant for reviewing this is an almost 4 year old girl (granddaughter).
This toy is a teacher/parent dream.
She sits for long periods of time learning letters and phonics!
Now she also enjoys the camera and recorder and makes her own books.
But the value of this for learning academics is almost unbelievable.When waiting, in the car or in restaurants or something similar, she will pull it out and learn some letter sounds or use the stylus to learn to write the letters.
The games are so much better than some I have seen.
She is totally interested in them.Now just in case you think it is only for the super littles, I have a request from an 8 year old grandson to get him one too.
This is a toy that has appeal for a rather large age range since the games can be for older kids or younger - as you need.
It is truly a fabulous addition to your ""keep a kid sitting quietly"" bag.
I imagine that will also be a large selling point as other parents see the kids totally quiet and involved and their kids see the leappad and ask for one too."
"Before even seeing this ""toy""(LeapFrog is to toys as Scorcese is to movies), I knew certain things about it.Since it came from LeapFrog, a brand I've dealt with frequently over the past few years, I knew it would be of good quality; educational; and fun.But I did not feel qualified to deal with the specifics of the tablet as I am, merely, an adult.
So I turned it over to our resident LeapFrog expert, Christian James, age 5and 1/2.First he, perhaps inadvertently, tested its durability by dropping it on the floor... hard!It worked fine.Then he tested the limits of creativity offered by the built in video camera and created his (Golden Globe nominated) film short ""Feet"".He also created and recorded the film's soundtrack featuring: ""I know you think you know this song, but not the way I sing it!""
(Platinum and climbing)Then he spent a couple of hours just going through various aps that ONLY appeared to be great fun AND educational at the same time, but he's 5 so he can be... what?
Yes!
I know!
...and 1/2, so he can be forgiven for this slip into the mundane.Putting it briefly: Christian James thinks this is the most fun thing he's played with, and LEARNED with, in quite a while.I'm forced to agree."
Are you looking for the most up to date in children's educational technology?
Well Leapfrog has come out with the Leappad Tablet, a children's educational computer tablet.
The tablet is touch screen compatible, it comes with two magnetic styluses and a USB adapter so that you can connect it to your PC and download applications directly from the Leapfrog Server Website.The tablet is lightweight and easy for a child or adult to carry from place to place.
It is backwards compatible with all Leapfrog Explorer cartridge games and you can also download various applications which are all extremely child friendly and great for any child ages 3-10.
My 4 year old daughter absolutely loves this and plays it a couple hours a day, which has not only increased her vocabulary but has taught her to trace letters and so she now wants to write words.I absolutely love this as an extra educational aid, however there are some minor issues.
One is that the battery life is only 8 hours so rechargeable batteries are a must.
Also an AC adapter is not included (it is sold separately).
Another thing to note is that if you get an AC adapter it doesn't actually charge the Leappad, it just keeps the batteries from draining.One essential accessory you will need to buy that also doesn't come with the table and isn't released until October is the Leappad Tablet Gel Skin Screen Protector.
This is probably necessary because if it isn't protected then just like the Nintendo DS, the screen will scratch.I have also had some technical problems with loading apps onto the pad itself, and sometimes apps go missing.
All I can say is that the Leapfrog customer service is extremely friendly, organized and prompt when answering technical issues and will sort any problems out you may have.
They will even reinstall your programs for you if worst comes to worse.Overall I highly recommend this to anyone who has a child, nephew, niece, grandchild!
This is a very fun, positive, educational and your children will love it and never put it down!
With the introduction of the iPod and iPad, Leapfrog was feeling ancient.
I mean you actually had to use buttons to use the tablet.
Leapfrog then came out with this new explorer tablet that is right up there with the iPad and touchscreen iPods.
The machine is touch screen using a stylus and offers children a fun but cool way to learn.
My boys loved it from the get go.
The games, while educational, are up their level and Leapfrog allows you to plug into your computer and download many more games that would be attractive to your child.
You don't have to buy the cartridges as you use to but now you just plug into your computer and download games in an instant.
The games are not boring either.
They offer unique challenges to children to play fast moving games, puzzles, riddles, and so many more options and each with a purpose of educating your child unlike brainless games found on the iPod or Nintendo DS.So for me the positives were: the games are reliable and fun.
The tablet itself is lightweight, easy to maneuver, and loads of fun.
It's cool looking as well.
Many children were asking my boys about their tablet when we went to church.
The education my boys get from playing the games is invaluable in of itself.
The battery life is excellent!The negatives: some of the games were a little pricey but not unreasonable.
As with any system, some of the games were not as fun as others but this is just the nature of gaming and not the fault of the Leapfrog itself.Overall this is a great pad and brings Leapfrog up to date with the iPad and other touch screen systems.
I would gladly buy another for my boys who are all under 10 years old by the way.
"We have one LeapFrog LeapPad Explorer that two boys share.
I've gotten a case and gel cover to help minimize the impact of drops, and so far it still looks brand new.
(we've had it about 6 months).
LOVE that the ""games"" are all educational and you can view your child's progress online after syncing the system with your computer (using the LeapFrog online system, which requires internet access).The only thing I dislike is that it SUCKS batteries fast, and as far as I know, they have not made re-chargeable batteries for this system yet.
We did purchase the AC adapter so we can use it while it is plugged in.
I want to say that a set of batteries lasted about 6 hours, but it has been a long time since we've used batteries.I love that there is a wide range of learning games, and have found that it is worth reading the details to see if a particular game is age appropriate."
