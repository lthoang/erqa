Reviews:
The Innotab 3S is a nice tablet.
It feels a bit lightweight and flimsy when handled.
The face is mostly plastic.
This is good to protect the device from falls/damage, but it makes the device seen a bit cheap.
The screen is disproportionately small compared to the size of the tablet.
The games are fun and keep the attention of my child.
The graphics are nice.
The ability to download games & pics wirelessly is a nice upgrade.
The camera only has a few pixels, but the forward and rear facing function is neat.
It has a video camera, which is fun.
Overall, my kindergartener enjoys it and plays with it often.
The first big issue with this is the battery life.
This thing just gobbled up batteries like crazy.
On the other hand, you can get a tablet that plugs in and not have to spend any money at all on batteries.
The games were just okay.
Spend your money on a tablet and you'll have practically unlimited choices on games and programs, plus it will grow with your child.
First off the design makes it look very modern with the black border and its sleek buttons.
My boys immediately wanted to play with it.
The processor speed is actually pretty fast which is a must because my kids have no patience and if it takes forever to load then they will give up.
The display is very kid-friendly and easy to use.
My boys (5 and 6) had no problem navigating the different apps and playing games.
I had downloaded some games off the Learning Lodge for them, in addition to some games we had already purchased for our VTech InnoTab 2S, and they have been set with their InnoTab.
Honestly for the price of just under $100, this is a great tablet for kids.
You can either purchase new cartridges featuring popular characters or download them off the Learning Lodge, I honestly prefer downloading them since we don't have to worry about loosing cartridges and my kids can have more games on hand at once.The D-pad (button on the left) is a great touch for kids to navigate games and you actually hold this tablet sideways, like you would a Nintendo DS or other video game system.
The screen though is touch screen and I had no problems tapping the screen, you do receive two plastic stylus pens also.My favorite feature is the included rechargeable battery pack with AC Adapter.
Yeah for no more throwing out batteries!
Other tablets we have had sold those separately so it is awesome that they are included in the low price.
It offers up to 9 hours of battery life!We haven't down much with the Kid Connect yet but basically you download Kid Connect on your smartphone and your child can send you picture and text messages.
Its a safe and secure communication.
I just couldn't figure out how to get them both working right, and my kids don't let me have any time on the InnoTab to keep trying!
Kids can also communicate with other kids who have an InnoTab 3S via WiFi and Kid Connect.
You do need to download the Kid Connect Premium from the Learning Lodge to really do more.The Kid-Safe Wi-Fi connection is a great touch as well.
We have had several InnoTab products.
I was pleased to see that some of my complaints about past modelsYou are still stuck with the Learning Lodge.
It is a fairly frustrating website to use.
You have to sign up before you can access your free programs.
Downloading programs takes a really long time.
We had multiple failures to download one program.There are not tons of apps for the upper age recommendations.
But the ones that are there are fun.
Keep in mind that you need to give this with a Learning Lodge Gift card or there won't be much to do.While downloading is slow, the 3S itself is faster than the 2S.
Things load more quickly and there doesn't seem to be hangtime.
I was very pleased that there were some sites that can be selected to visit.
We do have trouble sometimes with the 3S dropping wi-fi and having to re-enter our entire wi-fi security code.I love the rechargable batteries included.
I have fed our previous innotabs more batteries than I care to think about.
The batteries charge overnight hold a charge fairly well for rechargables.With all the things the InnoTab 3s can do, my kids still like the picture taking the most.
The camera works well and the pictures come out nicely.
"I picked up the VTech InnoTab 3S because I have a 4-year-old son who loves tablets but is too rough with them and I wanted something durable and easy for a 4-year-old kid to use.
Overall, the VTech InnoTab 3S is EXACTLY what I was looking for, but VTech needs to fix the Learning Lodge download manager software.Think of the Learning Lodge like the Apple App Store ... if the App Store was terrible.
Slow loading times, terrible interface, and the result is an overall crumby user experience that makes kids and parents upset.
If anyone from VTech is reading this all I can say is ""simplify, simplify, SIMPLIFY!""
The interface and graphics are unnecessarily complicated.
Most kids and parents don't have trouble using iOS on iPads/iPhones or Android on Android tablets and phones, but those same parents try to use Learning Lodge and their eyes start to bleed!
(Not really, but you get my point.)
Simplify the icons, simplify the store pages, etc.I do like how easy it is for my son to browse websites that I pre-approve and how easy it is for him to add apps to his wishlist without him actually making purchases on his own without my approval.
Also, thanks to VTech Kid Connect I can also control who my child is authorized to communicate with via text messages and send/receive photos (just Mom, Dad, and the grandparents for now).The MicroSD card slot makes it easy to add storage for photos and music so it's nice that the option to ""upgrade"" is there.The tablet is very durable and has some great features but I really, REALLY hope VTech strips away the superfluous crud from Learning Lodge and focuses on just making things WORK and work FAST."
This was decent.. but my mother in law got our 3 yr old a leapfrog and we actually were able to compare.
Its been 2 days so far but it just seems the leapfrog is a bit more polished with software abilities and etc.Alot is very similar, but this one has wifi and sd card slot and more..The learning lodge software is horrid IMO.I did have high hopes for the samsung galaxy 3 for kids but at $230 no way......All in all - this is OK.
But when comparing to leapfrom - its just not as good.
I had my grandkids play with this.
They were entertained for about 30 mins then wouldn't touch it.
Tried to get them to play some of the games and they were more interested in their parent's iPhones.
The Display is very pixelated compared to every tablet I've seen.
Granted this is a kids tablet it's still priced quite very high for what it is out of the box.
I would go with what other reviewers have suggested and spend a bit more to get a Nexus 7 or comparable tablet.
Also it comes with very limited amount of content for free (Out of the box).
In order to add games you will ave to purchase all through the vendor and a very high cost.
I've purchased my daughter the VTech Reader and the InnTab 2S in the past.
I do have to say that VTech must be taking feedback from customers and getting the small things right.PROS:- It comes with two styluses.
And as if the spare isn't enough, it comes with a string so you can attach the stylus to the InnoTab.
There's a slot to insert the stylus so that it doesn't flop around all over the place.
(Fingers work well on the touch screen, also.
)- There's no need to worry about batteries.
It comes with rechargeable batteries and an adapter.
The adapter enables your child to use the Innotab without batteries.
You can also use 4 AA batteries.- Cartridges purchased for the Innotab 2S also work with the 3S.- Though this won't fool your child into thinking they've got an adult tablet, it does satisfy and is durable.
I still have the VTech Reader from a couple of years back and the Innotab 2S from earlier this year and they both still work.CONS:- You're going to need to connect to the VTech Learning Lodge before your child can use any of the included apps.
I had it previously installed but it still took about ten minutes for updates to the software.
You'll want to have this done before giving it to your child since the tablet will be useless until it's done.- Photos taken with the tablet tend to turn out dark as there's no flash.OF NOTE: This version doesn't have the prop on the back to hold it upright like the last version.
My daughter never used that anyway so I didn't list the loss as a con.4.5 STARS: I wanted to compare the apps from the 2S to the 3S but was unable to examine it for long without my daughter snatching it out of my hands.
Most seemed similar to what was there before.
I did notice there was an e-reader app listed instead of the previous backpack.
With this version, you can use Kid Connect to send messages to your child.
I have a three-year-old daughter and she is always trying to grab her brother and sister's iPads.
I tried to let her play some learning games on mine and she wound up sitting on it and cracking the screen.
After that experience I was thrilled to get the opportunity to test out the Innotab 3S from Vtech.
Its a sturdy handheld tablet designed just for kids and its tough enough to put up with all they can throw at it.
Right off the bat, I can tell you ours has been dropped, thrown and kicked more than once and its none the worse for wear, but lets get on to talking about some of the other features.The InnoTab tablet comes complete with twenty different games and activities already installed.
There are a stories that can be read aloud, coloring pages, and games.
Two of the games my kids really liked were the Magic Beanstalk came where you raise the beans and watch them grow, like a virtual pet.
They also enjoyed the H2O maze game where you lead the water drop through the maze.
You have to be careful not to touch the sponges or you'll get absorbed and lose a life.
My youngest also loved the coloring pages.
There are several different pages and you can do them over and over again.
These are just a few examples.In addition to the games that are already installed, you can also go online to the Vtech store to find hundreds of other game options.
You get one game for free with your initial purchase.
My daughter picked out a Beach Day with Cody and Cora.
This game teaches counting skills and is perfect for preschool age.
It has her count shells and seagulls, all things that are familiar to her since we live at the Jersey Shore.
"HOW ARE LEAPPAD ULTRA AND INNOTAB 3S THE SAME?- Both use a stylus.- Both use a tilt feature for horizontal or vertical display.- Both have a cartridge port for additional games, and uses purchased apps.
(Previously owned cartridges will still work with the upgraded tablets, but are not interchangeable between LeapFrog & vTech).- Both have a 2 megapixel camera.
IT3S has a swivel camera.
LPU has a front and back camera.
Both take pictures and videos.- Both have additional accessories you can buy like gel skins, cases, and headphones.- Both can be personalize for individual players.- Both have eReaders, MP3 Players, art studio, and most of your basic themed books and games.
LPU includes 10 songs, and 4 apps (Art Studio, Photo Fun, Pet Pad, and Pet Chat).
It also includes a utility suite (calculator, notepad, calendar, voice memo, and clock with stopwatch).
When you register your LPU you get 1 free app (pick one of 3 preselected apps, not any app in the app store - bummer!).
IT3S includes 20 preloaded apps, and has a similar utility suite.- Both have a mic and volume control.- Some people like to creatively take the tablets out of the box for setup before giving to a child as a gift.
Both tablets are easy to remove.
Use sharp scissors to break the tape and fold out the box carefully.
With the LPU just lift up the plastic.
With IT3S pop the tablet out of it's plastic housing.
Both can be returned to the box for wrapping.- Both have a parent tracker that allows parents to track their child's progress and success playing a game.- Both have a d-pad to toggle (you can also use your finger or stylus).
IT3S seems more responsive when using a stylus, but I found the LPU was mostly good either way (like an iPad or other tablet).- Both have WiFi, which kids can use to make an app wishlist and send it to their parents to buy for them.
They can browse the Internet using ""LeapSearch"" and ""vTech Selected"" for pre approved sites, and search for images, videos, and websites by category.
The resident five-year-old is an InnoTab pro and was delighted with this upgraded version.
The main question for parents would be, if you have the old one, is the new one worth it?
I think it is.The best part for me is the rechargeable battery.
It lasts for about 9 hours.
On the old one, I changed the batteries way too much.
This one, I just plug in overnight and she's got tons of play.
The Wi-Fi is also nice.
There's a great little messaging system as well.
It also came with an extra stylus for when (not if) the first one gets lost!
She, of course, loves the camera function and immediately took about a hundred photos.The number of wonderful educational games and books available on line was just astounding.
Picking some for her system was almost overwhelming!
It does come with a few things preloaded, but your child will want some extra games!We are absolutely thrilled with the upgrades on this system.
My daughter thinks she's playing games.
I know that she's learning science, reading, and math!
Simply Terrific!
Pros: The InnoTab 3S is a good option for very small children who want to be like mom and dad and the expandable memory and learning aspect is always a plus.
The casing is durable, and easily to clean.
The rechargeable battery pack has a very long life and has come close to the advertised 9 hours of play.
The downloadable content is vast, offering a wide range of education and fun options.Cons: downloadable content is costly, internet is slow and the picture quality is not very good.
VTech's InnoTab 3S offers many of the same features as its predecessor but with some slight improvements.
Set up will take a while as one has to register with the VTech Learning Lodge page and follow the prompts to enable Wi-Fi as well as the downloading of the various apps and games.
The tablet already comes with around 20 Apps but an average elementary schooler will get bored of them in no time.
The Wi-Fi allows for some understandably limited browsing but is rather unreliable, as well.
Depending on one's particular location and configuration, expect the little ones to complain about the slowness of this feature.
As with previous models, the video camera and rotating camera is built-in, but the camera still takes unusually dark photos for some reason.
Granted, the camera is only 2.0 megapixels, but it is frustrating that any photos taken indoors, no matter how brightly lit, still look dark.
The real selling point for the InnoTab 3S are the included rechargeable batteries and adapter.
For anyone who has owned similar tablets, there are nothing more than battery hogs at the hands of a child.
Luckily, it seems that manufacturers have wised up to this common complaint and bundled the necessary accessories to allow for virtually unhindered usage.
Overall, with the addition of the batteries and the albeit slow Wi-Fi, the Innotab 3S is worth purchasing.
