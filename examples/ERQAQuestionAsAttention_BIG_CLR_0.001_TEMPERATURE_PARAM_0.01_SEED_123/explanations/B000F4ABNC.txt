Reviews:
This toy copter is a very fun and durable toy.
It has withstood my 15 month old little boy and has lived to fly another day.
The animals it comes with are cute as well.
The pilot is a cool addition too.
Recommended for all the little veterinarians out there.
"When we first got this toy, I was ready to sing it's praises!
It was SO much fun!
Not only did both of my boys(4 and 17months) love it, but I did too.
*I* was having a blast playing with this toy right along with them.
I was already looking at other toys in this line to add to our toy collection.The best part about it?
NO BATTERIES!
I just thought that was incredibly clever to create such a fun toy that wasn't dependent on the added cost of batteries.There's 5 pieces in this collection.
First, you get the helicopter with a spot for the driver to sit up front.
There's a trigger that you press over and over(your finger gets a workout...think water gun) that causes the propeller to spin.
There's also a magnet attached at the front/bottom of the helicopter that picks up the ""injured"" animals that need to be rescued.
You get 3 animals.
They are so cute with their various bandages to show they are injured!
;) They each have a small metal ball attached at their head, so the magnet on the helicopter can pick them up.
Once you've got the animal attached to the helicopter, you fly them to safety.
Once there, there's a lever on the side of the helicopter that you turn and it releases the animal.
It's an AWESOME toy for imaginative play!
How durable the toy is will only be told through time, however it seems sturdily built and substantial.
The kids love playing with it and do not seem to tire of it.
This is the first WOW toy I've had and I am impressed with the colors and the fact you do not need batteries to make it function.
I don't think this will be the last one I get.
First, the best thing about this toy is that it is not battery powered--we have enough of those and are always replacing batteries.
This toy is activated by a trigger pull which spins the helo's rotor.
The second fun feature is the magnetic pick-up.
The bottom of the helo has a magnetic pick-up that allows the kids to pick up and transport the animals included in the set--thus the premise of the animal rescue.
Our nephew (2 1/2) seemed to enjoy the helo but may get more out of it when he is a little older.
I love these toys and wish they were more available here in the US.
They are fun, durable, cute and made well.
My son has the camper and this and he loves them both.
"My one year old loves this toy.
Although he is too young to do any ""rescuing"" of the animals, he enjoys playing around with the helicopter in general.
Maybe it's the propeller that fascinates him, maybe it's the bright colors, I don't know, but it's a hit at our house.
I LOVE the fact that this toy doesn't require any batteries....that saves money AND the planet.
Why can't more toy companies do this?
Anyway, this is my first expierence with the WOW line of toys, and if they are all like this then I would definitely purchase more in the future."
"I love this toy and so does my tot.
As a parent, I love it because it's simple but engaging fun without requiring batteries.
The magnetic feature allows you to ""rescue"" animals and by turning the search light you can drop them off.
This takes coordination and skills.
You can also make the helicopter blades and it makes sounds like a rotor.
My 2 year old has stuck his hands in the ""blades"" while we were making them spin and they are very gentle, does not hurt at all.
I think this is a toy my child can grow with and it is great that it does not even require batteries like so many toys."
I'm very pleased with this toy animal rescue helicopter - really appreciate that it does not require batteries and has a lot of room for a child to use his/her own imagination while playing with it.
My 3 year old grandson loved making the propeller go and carried it around with him everywhere for a couple of days.
"Every kids that sees this toy loves it!
The helicopter flies around everywhere on ""rescue missions"" to save the animals and bring them home safely.
The animals are adorable and the helicopter lifts the toys by an embedded magnet in the top of the animal and the noise of the helicopter.
When you rotate the search light on the helicopter the magnet retracts and the animal drops away.My only complaint is that the trigger action that causes the helicopter blades to spin only lasted about 10min.
The kids hardly miss it and the rest of the toys has definitely been through more than it's fair share of crashes and tug of war matches but it's a bummer to have a cool feature break so quickly.
Even with that weakness this is still a great toy and I'd recommend it.
***UPDATE***We wrote to the folks at WOW and they set us a new Harry Copter's Animal Rescue and the blade spinning action is top notch with this one.
Kudo's for AWESOME support above and beyond!"
The WOW Harry Copter's Animal Rescue Safari Vehicle (that's a helicopter, people) would be a great set, if it wasn't for the fact that it  has some definitely quality control issues.
Like so many others are reporting, the helicopter rotor has issues and now doesn't spin all the time when you pull the trigger.
You can hear that it's not catching the way it should, so I'm guessing there must be some gear that strips with even moderate use.
They call it a sturdy handle in the product description, but the mechanism behind it surely isn't.It's a shame too, because my two year-old daughter loves this toy.
She loves the little animals which attach to the rescue copter via a magnet, she loves the little doctor pilot figure (Dr. Harry Copter, I presume...) and she loves the rescue copter itself.
As much as she loves it though, it's hard to recommend any toy that isn't going to last even two weeks.
It's colorful, appears durable and has provided hours of playtime.
Our child has numerous toy  helicopters and this is his favorite.
He enjoys the magnetic animal lift and discharge, as well as the spinning the blades.
That it doesn't require batteries is a plus.
Recommended!
It had gotten 20 minutes attention from my 4-yr old when he first got it.
He played the coper, made the clacking sound with the friction trigger, hooked up each animals in turn.Now it gets occasional play when my son sorts his transportation toys or safari toys.Very sturdy.Not a lot of education value.
So the product description on the box says this is for ages 1-5.
In actuality, this is probably great for the 2-3 set, but a little too young for the 4-5 set.The Copter is very well made and is of durable, colorful plastic.
Each animal as a little magnet on it that attaches to the magnet on the Copter.
There's a little trigger on the bottom of the Copter that activates the rotors, making them spin and whir.It comes with three animals and one rescue vet.
The animals are cute and each sports a visible bandage or cast showing where they need to be treated.Fantastic for Imaginative play!
"There are five parts to this toy: the helicopter, a doctor/helicopter pilot, and a three animals -- a lion, alligator and panda, all with various injuries that are bandaged up.
The animals all have magnets on their heads so the helicopter can latch onto them and ""medevac"" them out of wherever they are.
The helicopter is battery-free, and the blades start to turn when you press on a manual trigger underneath the toy.Our two-year-old loves this toy, and we think he understands and enjoys the idea that the doctor is helping the animals.
He understands the bandages on the animals and talks about their ""boo-boos"".
So far, the toy has proven sturdy.
Our son has thrown the helicopter a few times.
Although we have read about the blade's motor mechanism breaking easily, this has not been our experience, yet.Still, this toy is probably better for 2-3 year old kids, rather than kids from 18 months as officially recommended by the manufacturer, for a few reasons.
First is the danger of it breaking through rough handling, although maybe we are naive to think our boy will treat his toys better as he gets a little older.
Second is that he is not yet able to pull the ""trigger"" to make the blades go around himself.
This requires more motor skills and finger strength than he has, and maybe just a little more cognitive ability.
I've tried to help him do it, but he just doesn't seem to grasp the purpose.We like that it doesn't require batteries, and overall we're very satisfied.
Recommended."
