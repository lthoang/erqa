Are there other engines that you can buy that would also work on this set?
Is there a replacement train for this track? My son submerged his Thomas in H2O Now won't work. :(
can I buy other pieces for this set
got 2 of those and train doesn't work in both, replaced batteries, still doesn't work. any suggestions?
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
I have a houseful of train-lovers, and we've played with lots of different Thomas train sets over the years.
At a list price of just under $40, I think this is the most affordable, fun, interactive, and complete set we've owned!This set includes a motorized, talking Thomas and cargo car, a large-scale, plastic figure 8 track layout with a little bridge, and two station stops.
Thomas has three different buttons on top to make him go, so you can send him to Brendham Docks to see Cranky, to Tidmouth Sheds to see Gordon, James, and Percy, or just endlessly looping around the track, talking as he goes.
Thomas' eyes actually move when he talk, and wow, does Thomas talk!
He says so many different things that it takes a surprisingly long time for the talking to become repetitive.Anyway, this is a great first train set, and I think it's absolutely perfect for 18-month-olds to 3-year-olds.
They love to push buttons, make noise, and watch things move.
Even better, the track stays firmly popped together - even on carpet - and Thomas is easy to put on the tracks, so there's nothing about the set to trigger that oh-so-easily generated toddler frustration.
Overall, a really amazing Thomas set for little ones!
This is a very well made toy.
Unlike some toys on the market today, this toy is not flimsy, cheap plastic.
The pieces are strong and easy to assemble.
If you have a little one who loves Thomas the Train, this would be a great gift.
While little ones may need help setting up the track at first, I think they will quickly learn how to do it.
Thomas also works off the track, which makes it fun to use anywhere and anytime.
This Thomas the Train toy is fabulous!
The tracks were easy to put together.
There are instructions but I was able to put it together quickly and accurately by just looking at the picture on the box.
One thing I was not pleased with when assembling the train was the fact that once I put the big crane in it's little slots, I can't get it out!
I'm not sure if you're supposed to be able to but when I tried to get it out, it definitely seemed like it was going to break.
This wouldn't be a problem expect for the fact that if you want to store the pieces in the box, the crane won't fit back in there when it's partially assembled like this.Thomas moves on his own and goes to the two different locations along the tracks as he's directed.
You direct him by pushing different buttons on the train.
Thomas also talks at the different stations, saying several different things.
It's pretty entertaining!
You can also make Thomas move off the tracks.
We were able to get him to move on his own on our carpet, so it's a pretty powerful little train.
This is a lot of fun for kids of all ages!
"My kids really enjoy this train set.
It has a standard configuration for the track (not ""mix and match"").
Thomas has three buttons on top that will take him over the bridge, to the station or to the docks to load up.
He says different things and the toy is quite cute.
It was easy to assemble and packaged so that there weren't millions of zip ties to struggle with, which I appreciated.
The track itself doesn't take up a ton of space.
The train rides around on its own, which the kids enjoyed.
Somehow my 3 year old thought it'd be a great idea to run Thomas over her head, and her hair got wound up pretty good in the wheels.
It took me a good 10 minutes to free her hair out of the wheel.
(I did try to see if I could break the wheel off, and it is super secure!
Which is great for my 1 year old, I know he can't pop the wheels off and choke on them).
My daughter has certainly learned her lesson, but just in case your child is equally ""curious"" - best to keep an eye on them when they first get this toy, so they know to keep it on the track, or at least off their head of long hair :)"
While setting it up, I just went by colours and at one point I couldnt get the tracks to fit and then I realised that I interchanged the position of green tracks.
After that the setup was easy.
Thomas is a powerful engine.
He doesnt even need tracks, he will jut wheel off even on the carpet.
The cargo falls off sometimes while going downslope after crossing the bridge.
Thomas asks once in a while where would we like him to go.
The volume should have been tunable.This toy will charm kids for some years.
My toddler likes seeing Thomas go on track but I have seen the pride of a 4 year old when his father asked him to setup the whole system.
Till your kids get onto a real train and beyond, Thomas will fascinate them with his googly eyes.
This is a great train set for small kids.
It's simple, compact and the train is easy for small kids to operate and get lined up on the track without assistance.The little extras that make this set awesome:1.
Easy to set up.
I just looked at the picture on the box and put the tracks together to match.
I didn't read the directions.2.
Thomas the Train works both on and off the tracks.3.
Size is small enough to set up on a coffee table, it won't invade your whole home.
You can also lift it up in one piece when assembled and move it to another location.4.
The detail given to Thomas is great, his eyes and mouth move as he talks.
Makes him come alive almost.5.
You can operate Thomas continually... meaning he'll just loop around the track again and again (although after awhile he stops on his own...
I think to preserve battery) or press one of the other buttons and he'll go to that destination on the track.There isn't much I can find to complain about actually.
This is a really great first train set.UPDATE 10/23/13 - My youngest still LOVES this train set.
He plays with it regularly.
We all know some toys get played with for awhile then forgotten, but that is not the case with this one.
The train has needed it's batteries changed once so far.
My 4 year old son loves Thomas.
This is one of his favorite Thomas toys.
He's been playing with it for several weeks.Thomas goes around the track making comments.
He has animated eyes and mouth.
The track assembles easily, but you have to remember to keep the instructions about which sections go where since it can only be assembled in one configuration.
Sensors on the train allow Thomas to know what section he is on and to make appropriate comments.
You can push one of the two location buttons to send Thomas to a specific location.
The train also works off the track, but it doesn't talk automatically.The train and track are sturdy and have survived being stepped on and a 1 year old sister.
Battery life is excellent.I wish there were add on track sections.
"When this toy arrived, I was a little disappointed, because it was marked for ages ""18 months and up"", but that just means it's durable and doesn't have a lot of small pieces.
The three-year-old is loving his role as a train-master by pushing the buttons and sending the train to its designated location.One caveat: if the train is a surprise, gently place the box in its hiding place when it arrives, because it is packed for store impulse buying, with a ""touch here"" element that starts talking at the slightest provocation."
My grandson is all about trains, so he loves Thomas.
He loved this Thomas play set.
The eyes and mouth move, and it has buttons that control where Thomas should stop and go.
It was simple enough for him to operate, but he did need some help setting it all up.
He is 2 1/2.
It is quality made and does not feel flimsy.
I think it is a great gift for the 2 1/2 and up ages.
Fisher-Price suggests an age range of 18 mos to 4 yrs, but our one year old grandson just loves this train set too.
He doesn't fully understand yet what each of the three buttons on Thomas the Train do, but he knows pressing any will start locomotion action either on or off the tracks.
It's durable, has lots of appealing colors and the tracks are so simple to build or take apart.
We have a wooden starter train set as well, but it is still a little too complicated for a one year old to master.In the meantime, this is the perfect transition train set.
Its simple operation is just enough to keep our little guy fascinated for spells at a time.
He enjoys watching Thomas the Train move his eyes and mouth, and he can easily operate Thomas all by himself.
Once located on the tracks, Thomas stays on them well and talks along the way.
Best of all, he works anywhere, making train fun possible throughout the house.
That's enough activity at this stage to keep our grandson happy, but it's just a matter of time before he attempts track assembly.
Thomas and Friends are an all time favorite of kids.
I love that you can always predict that the quality on these will be good.
The pieces feel solid and not cheaply made.
It was very easy to assemble and kids will love taking part in that as well.
The toy itself is very interactive and Thomas, with his moving eyes is simply a delight for little kids.
The buttons on the roof are fun for the kids to control.
I highly recommend a Thomas train set for your little kids.
My daughter loves Thomas, and has many of the wooden train cars, so we were very excited to open this toy.
It was very easy -- for an adult -- to put together.
However, the nature of the tracks will make it difficult, or even impossible, for a young child to put together unless they have memorized how to do it.
An adult, without even seeing the photo, could put the tracks together properly just by process of elimination.The tracks make a loop, and the enclosed Thomas train goes around the loop.There are several stops that Thomas can make along the way, and by pressing the buttons on the top of the train, you can choose where he will go.
How does Thomas know where to go?
The peripheral snap-on pieces on the side of the tracks interact with the engine.
Which means that if the 2-yr-old wanders off with the loading station piece, Thomas won't be stopping there.One great thing about this toy is that Thomas never falls of the tracks -- he's on there pretty good and just goes around and around as many times as you like.Thomas also talks, which is really pretty neat, but my daughter was a bit put off by that.
If you have a kid who isn't crazy about talking toys (like both of mine), this version of Thomas won't go over well.One aspect of this toy which was not surprising, but still annoying, is that none of the other Thomas brand toys we have will work with this set.Obviously the small wooden trains won't fit on the track, but even the larger plastic trains we have in our collection are not the same size, either.
I don't see as where you can purchase other trains for this set.Overall, it was a fun toy that the children played with for some time.
It's unwieldy to store, of course, but that's the very nature of train sets.
I wouldn't imagine kids older than 4 or 5 would have much interest in this toy unless they were dyed-in-the-wool Thomas fans.
I love this toy for so many reasons!First - despite many hours of playing already, the batteries are still working!Second - You push the button on top of Thomas' head and it will automatically stop at the desired spot, no matter which way the toy is driving!Third - there is a button to let it go nonstop for a while.
Up over the bridge, across the tracks, and around.
So.
Much.
FUN.My only thought is to try to put it on a flat surface because we started out on a bumpy surface and he derailed slightly every few go rounds.
Moved it to the hardwood and it's been perfect since.I will be looking for more toys in this series to add on.
Who needs a train table when you can stick this on a coffee table and have as much fun!

Thomas and Friends: Real Talking Thomas Train is a fun toy, for a little while, before it becomes rather annoying.
This set comes with a figure 8 train track set, a Thomas train engine, a cart and two barrels.
Thomas travels the track by himself with the push of three different buttons.
My 2 1/2 year old enjoys the train, but seeing as Thomas says a limited amount of phrases and sentences, it can get tiresome for the adults who have to listen to it.
Plus, my child wants to take the train of the tracks and this toy is not made for playing on carpet, not that it needs to be.
This Thomas offering sports pretty multi-colored tracks which are easy to set up.
The talking Thomas train is also well constructed and properly detailed.
Thomas works both on and off the tracks, and his eyes and mouth really move when talking.
This makes Thomas look very animated looking, kind of like the old Teddy Ruxbin bears.
You can press the location button and command Thomas to go to various locations, like visit Cranky or get supplies from Tidmouth.
There is even a supply car for cargo deposits!
My son loves watching Thomas talk and complete a hard days work!
Thomas and Friends: Real Talking Thomas Train Set is the perfect set for younger children.
It's made of durable plastic and is easy to set up.
It will fit on your wooden train table with room to spare.
My son absolutely adores this set, especially Cranky the Crane.
Thomas comes with 3 colored buttons, 1 to go to Tidmouth Sheds, 1 for the Docks, and the other to go on an Adventure.
Thomas with talk to your child and tell them where he's going and interact with each destination.I fell in love with this toy immediately and my son and I played with it for hours.
He loves it and so do I. I would definitely recommend it to any family who loves Thomas!
My little boy loves Thomas the Train and he was thrilled to play with this toy.
The coolest feature about this toy is that the train comes with various color coded buttons that allows the child to push the color and the train will automatically go to the color that the child pushes.
The voice expresses what the train is doing.Overall this is a good toy and I do recommend it.
It is worth the price and my little boy enjoys it.
My little boy played with it much when we first got the toy and he is still playing with it two weeks later.
I am impressed with any toy that will keep his attention that long.
The toy is plastic but very durable.
"I ordered this for my 20 month-old son, and he was pretty excited when we put it together.
It is easy to click the tracks into place and figure out where each one went.
There are 3 buttons on the top of the train, and each one dictates where the train will stop on the track.
The green button never really worked for us.
I did what the instructions said and pushed the other buttons to reset it, but we could never get it to stop at the ""docks.""
This wasn't a problem for us, though, because my son didn't really understand it was supposed to stop at a certain place anyway.
He just liked pushing the buttons and making the train go.
It talks as well, and that is kind of cute.
The plastic is really durable for kids this age.
We're happy with our order."
As much as I tried to avoid the Thomas obsession, it has hit my son hard!
He loves all things Thomas the Train and this set made his eyes light up when he first saw it!
We've had it for a couple of weeks now and he plays with it multiple times a day.
Loves the talking Thomas and really loves that Thomas can move on his own.It rests on a small play table we have and has taken many tumbles off (the entire set has hit the ground numerous times).
That's what happens with a rough toddler!
Everything has stayed intact and no plastic has cracked or broken.
Batteries still going strong!Highly recommended for younger fans of Thomas.
My son is 20-months-old and only needs help with putting it together.
"My 1 1/2 year old nephew loves this toy!
He can push the buttons himself so he gets proud that he made Thomas go!
He uses it off the track too.
It is cute, when you push one of 3 buttons it says different things or stops at a specific place along the track and ""communicates"" with the character there.
Easy to assemble snap together tracks make putting it together a breeze!
The toy is small enough that you wont have to worry about where to set it up.
Overall I would certainly recommend this toy to anyone in that ""Thomas"" age."
"This is easy to put together.
It is colorful and really seems to make kids happy just when they look at it, let alone play with it.
It makes sounds, but they are not outrageously loud like some other ""sound"" toys I have had.
The train will run on the floor, not just the tracks.
All the parts seem durable enough that is appears it will last a long time.
The battery lasts a long time, and typically toys comes with cheap batteries, so a good battery will last even longer.Overall, this is a good choice for a kid and the cost is pretty good."
My son enjoys this product quite a bit despite still being a little young to fully appreciate it.Right off the bat, the track itself is a bit of a puzzle.
It only really goes together one way, so it's good to exercise problem solving skills.
It's also durable enough that you can leave it put together and kick it around without really worrying about it breaking.Thomas himself is motorized and has 3 buttons to push.
Each corresponds to some stop along the way.
So one button will send him to the Cranky the crane to pick up some freight.
Another will send him to the station where some friends are, and the other just seems to be a freestyle type of thing.Thomas has small conversations with the other characters embedded in the track.
He's able to recognize where he is because there are specifically placed 'nubs' on the track that trigger a switch on his undercarriage.
So it gives the illusion that Thomas has some animus.
It also means Thomas is able to perfectly line up his cart with Cranky's ramp that loads the barrels.It ends up being a fairly simple toy, which makes for less frustration and more fun.
My son loves it and I think it would make a great gift for anyone that enjoys Thomas.
"We picked this up for our two year old as a ""transition toy"" to give him after the arrival of our new baby.
It has been a spectacular success.
This has been his favorite toy for three weeks now.
He spends hours playing with this every day.
The train engine, ""Thomas"", has been dropped or driven off table tops and ledges hundreds of times and still looks and performs like new.
He takes apart and puts together the tracks and props to create different track layouts, but the train does not need the tracks to function.
Our son drives this train on everything.
This toy is a very well spent $40 bucks.
Highly recommended."
