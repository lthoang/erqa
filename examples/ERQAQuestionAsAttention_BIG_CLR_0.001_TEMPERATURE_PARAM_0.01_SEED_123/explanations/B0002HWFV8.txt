Reviews:
This is a really beautiful puzzle, but it is far from easy.
We worked on it at a leisurely pace over the course of about a month, with some very frustrating patches.
The border was easy enough to construct, but the vast blue area at the top and the green area along the bottom made for some difficult work.
The only hints to help you in the search are very slight variations in the hues of each color.
The castle itself came together relatively quickly.I love Germany, and the Neuschwanstein Castle is one of my favorite attractions in the country.
This puzzle makes for a beautiful pictoral represention.
My plan is to apply some puzzle glue and frame it like a poster.So in short, I highly recommend the puzzle, but would caution that you be prepared for some complicated work.
This is a beautiful puzzle.
I love the blue backing on the pieces --which makes them easier to find when they're dropped on the floor.
The pieces are small as one would expect.
I like the variety of colors in this picture.
My husband visited Neuschwanstein 10 years ago, so I thought he would enjoy this puzzle.
As soon as I saw these pieces, though, I have to admit that I realized that I prefer 500 piece puzzles at this stage in my life.
I have 3 children and I'm pretty busy.
I like to be able to sit down for a few minutes and find a piece or two that I can put in pretty quickly.
With a 1000 piece puzzle, that is hard to do.
It's a lot easier to feel successful at a 500 piece puzzle.
I think 500 pieces will probably be the largest that my children are able to tackle for several years as well.
There's a really big jump down in piece size from the 500 piece puzzles to the 1000 piece puzzles.
Still, this is a beautiful puzzle for adult puzzlers!
To help one of my kid's concentration in school, we began focusing on reading, puzzles, Legos, and outdoor activities, at the expense of video games and TV.This Ravensburger puzzle is of great quality, and has a beautiful shot of the famous Neuschwannstein Castle in southern Bavaria - Germany.I would recommend getting a big table that is not used for other activities for at least a few days, if not weeks.
In our case, we have a large table in the basement for Puzzles, rather than starting it in our Dining Room.
The top area of the puzzle is probably the hardest - as it concerns the sky.
If you are new to puzzles, I would not venture out to more than 1,000 pieces at first.
This is a beautiful, well-made, sturdy puzzle that will transport you to the King Ludwig's castle in the heart of Bavaria.
I had the 1500-piece version of this puzzle on my kitchen table for a couple weeks and never managed to finish it, so I was delighted to give the 1000-piece version a try.
The size is a little more manageable -- it didn't cover the entire kitchen table -- and it was a delight to work on.Ravensberger puzzles are of consistently high quality.
The pieces are sturdy and fit together well.
The picture doesn't separate from the cardboard backing (even when they've been kicked around the floor by the cat and discovered several days later, under a cabinet).
The designs or photographs, this one no exception, are beautiful and interesting.
II don't think you'd go wrong with any Ravensgerger product.I found this puzzle to be fairly challenging, due to the large expanse of sky and the trees, but not impossible.
The edges and castle part were fairly easy to put together, but the trees and sky were a bit of a challenge.
I don't think it would be too much for an experienced or avid puzzler, though.
It's been a very long time since I last worked on a puzzle.
Years, at least.
Decades?
Possibly.
So as a result this puzzle is a bit of a challenge to me.
1,000 pieces, lots of blue, lots of green, very Germanic.
Like, REALLY Germanic.
I kept getting the impression that if I tried to put it together wrong, serious men in black coats would show up at my front door at night.But though it's been a challenge, and though after a couple days of working on it with a friend it STILL isn't finished, it's been a very fun challenge.
The puzzle itself just looks lovely.
The pieces are all very durable, the printing is bright and clear and the picture on the front does an excellent job of illustrating the finished product, except for the lower right-hand corner, where part of the forest area is covered by a little banner.Really, I can't think of a single complaint I have about this, aside from that minor one about the banner.
This is a good, well-made puzzle and I look forward to finishing it and moving onto the next one from this company!
When I first saw the box for this puzzle I swore I had done it before.
It's a rather generic image but as for the puzzle itself this one is top notch.
There is a nice distribution of areas with a cloudy sky, mountains, trees, lake and of course the castle which is by far the easiest section to put together.
What can kill a puzzle is large areas of similar looking patterns with similar shaped pieces Ravensburger's pieces are sufficiently distinctive that even in similar colored areas I never found myself frustrated.
The sky contains a lot of blues but they contain enough gradient from light to dark that I was able to sort them and put them together without much difficulty.For me the most challenging section was the trees but even there I was able to separate them by different colored leaves so although the puzzle was challenging it was never frustrating.
Most times I could look at a piece and find it's location on the front of the box and that's not always true with puzzles.
From the thickness of the pieces to the sharpness of the image there really isn't more I can ask from a puzzle.
It took me about three days to put this together.
Not sure how many total hours but Ravensburger kept me entertained throughout the build.
Highly Recommend.
This is a good quality puzzle.
The pieces are thick and durable; not a single one bent while we were completing the puzzle.
The picture is attractive.
There are some areas of varying difficulty in the puzzle.
The castle is relatively easy, while the forest is a bit harder, and the mountains and sky are even harder.
The sky is colored in varying shades of blue, so even that is doable without too much randomly placing of identical-looking blue pieces to see if they fit -- the hue and shape of the pieces give some clues.
High-quality puzzle - solid pieces, vibrant colors, and excellent photography.
I would rate the difficulty at a 7/10.
The sky is definitely tricky, but not overly so.This is a great way to ensure some family time.
I just set it out on the table and started working on it.
One by one the whole clan had stopped by to help.
Soon we were all working on it together and talking about the days events.
What a great way to get us to slow down from our busy lives.
This is the best puzzle I've ever had.
The picture is beautiful - and upon opening the box, it was pretty evident that the company actually cares about their product:  all the puzzle pieces were in a sealed bag within the box, with a couple pieces of paper about the products inside the box.
After tearing open the bag and dumping it into the box and starting the slow process of puzzle building, it also was obvious that the puzzle pieces themselves were quality:  the pieces are sturdy, don't have little dangling pieces of cardboard, are all FULLY cut, and is very easy to see when pieces fit together or not.Several days later, we have this on our kitchen table about half-done; anytime there are a few moments before/after a meal, we spend a bit of time getting a few more pieces together.
My 6-year old had made it his mission to separate all the like-colors and like-patterns into groups to speed things along, and from those groups, he's been connecting 4-5 pieces together so it looks like we have a couple different puzzles going at the same time.While it may sound a bit boring, we've all been enjoying putting this puzzle together, and from what we've done so far, the completed puzzle is going to be as brilliant and beautiful as the picture on the box (rather than a fuzzier version that some puzzles end up.
)Would recommend!
"My ratings above:1.Fun, yes very much so.
This is my first Ravensburger puzzle and I AM impressed with both the quality of the image itself and also the pieces too.
I have never seen such nice-fitting totally interlocking pieces before.
Real Nice!2.Educationality, of course, is subjective.
If you are not familiar with the story of this beautiful structure, and/or if you have children, then this is a great chance to educate yourself further in the saga of how and why this impressive fairy-tale-type castle was built and what the effect was that it had on the coffers of Germany's treasury and, further, what happened to Ludwig himself.
It is a fabulous story that may lead you deeper into history, into music and into psychology, too!3.Durability.
As I stated above at 1., I have never seen a puzzle with pieces engineered to a fit like this.
This puzzle will remain great fitting for years through many assemblies.4.Five stars, of course!
Were it possible to give it more, then I would do so.
The overall impact of this puzzle for the beauty of this image, quality of printing, for structure, and for the ""feel-good"" feeling you get through the pleasure of the way the pieces fit, is really pleasing.This was a Vine selection, and on the impact this product has left on me, I will be purchasing puzzles from Ravensburger for Christmas and birthday presents for my family and friends.
It is wonderful when you discover a truly high-quality ""toy"" (or anything nowdays) like this.
You are sure to be pleased with the beauty and craftsmanship presented here by Ravensburger and Co.~operabruin"
I love puzzles and this one did not disappoint me.
It was a definite challenge and worth all the time I put into making it whole.
The quality of the puzzle pieces is superb and the image was fantastic.
This is the first Ravensburger Puzzle I've put together, and I would love to own a more.
If you like a challenge, then this puzzle is for you!
"If you are a frequent puzzler, you can probably look at the box and tell exactly what you will be doing most of the time.
And having constructed the puzzle, I can tell you: You're right!
Sky and Trees!For this puzzle, I started with the sky, then the misty mountains, and finished with the trees.
This required many hours of enjoyable puzzling.
This puzzle is a harder one, too hard for my children.
You will find yourself looking for odd shaped bumps, and sorting pieces by basic shape to aid in doing the sky.
Yes, the sky has a gradient, which is helpful.My daughter did the castle, which took her no time at all.
Maybe an hour.
It would have taken me much less than 30 minutes.
The castle is like the tootsie roll in the middle of the tootsie roll pop.
Can you do the trees, sky, and mountains with succumbing to the temptation to do the castle first?We do a lot of puzzles, and as with most Ravensburger puzzles the quality is excellent.
We had two or three pieces where a piece of the backing came off and stuck to another piece.The ""soft click"" technology was very nice as always.
Not all 1000 pieces click, but most do.
And you can always tell if you put the wrong piece in because the cut lines always line up (which is not true for other puzzle manufacturers).One thing that Ravensburger did that was really really nice... is that the box is nicely oversized.
The pieces don't even fill it half way up.
Thats nice because the picture of the castle is big enough that its easy to spy the details in the picture, which aids in puzzling.
I got this though the Amazon Vine program for review.
This was a very high quality puzzle that was fun to put together.
Compared to other puzzles that I have done this one has a larger number of pieces that are different shapes, this is a wonderful thing because it means pieces only go together one way and this makes the puzzle much less frustrating to put together.
I recently did a puzzle where many of the pieces fit together even if they were the wrong pieces; this was very frustrating in solid color regions of the puzzle...it really drove home how important the need for lots of unique shapes for the pieces is.The castle portion of the puzzle was a lot of fun to put together, as were the mountains.
The sky, clouds, and forest parts of the puzzle were much more difficult and took a lot of time.
As such I would recommend this puzzle for intermediate to advanced puzzlers.
It you are a beginning puzzler expect to spend large portions of time putting together those regions of the puzzle.All in all a very high quality puzzle, me and my family had a lot of fun putting it together.
Ravensburger makes great puzzles and, like all of their puzzles, this one comes with a certificate of authenticity/manufacture.
"How cool is it that as I was assembling this puzzle, my husband has locked up the TV doing a DVR recording of a show called, ""The Alps from the Air"".
So what a treat it was to be working on this puzzle while watching a segment on the actual castle... an amazing piece of architecture and history tucked away in the Alps!As with other Ravensburger products (and puzzles) the quality is great.
The pieces are solid and easy to grip, the printing is clean and easy to see and compare to the picture on the box and the pieces stay together well.
The trees and blue sky are a mild mind killer, difficult to sort so a challenge to assemble - but one piece at a time, very doable.
I remember doing a puzzle once that was only the face of a black cat.
All you could do was pick out the eyes and some whiskers.
All the rest were just plain black pieces.
Now that was a killer puzzle and makes this look like a walk in the park!Well made, interesting to assemble and a fun weekend project."
1000 Pieces!
What a way to spend your afternoons... for the next ten years!
Actually, I finished this puzzle in 4 days.
The pic is a breath taking vista and the pieces were perfectly cut, fitting the abutting pieces flawlessly.
Ravenburger is a company hat knows their stuff!
Everything I've seen from them so far is of the utmost highest quality material and build.
They care and it shows in their products.
No frayed ends, no splitting.I'll never get my puzzles from anywhere else!
Ravensburger is by far my favorite manufacturer of puzzles.
And what I like most - apart from the outstanding quality of the puzzles - is the variety.
They make puzzles in a variety of shapes and sizes.
They make puzzles that are titanic projects (you can get even get a 32,000 Keith Haring puzzle that is so immense it comes with its own hand truck), but also make some really nice small puzzles.
I especially love their 500 piece puzzles.
They don't take much time, but they provide a lot of entertainment.
This is important to me because I have a cat who likes to bat the pieces around, so I like puzzles I can finish rather quickly.But when I have a bit more time, the 1,000 piece puzzles can also be a ton of fun.
This particular puzzle is an especially nice one.
I have a preference for scenes of castles and other historic buildings.
Ravensburger actually has a 2,000 piece puzzle of the Neuschwanstein Castle (Neuschwanstein Castle 2000 PiecePanorama XXL Puzzle) that shows a winter scene in widescreen panorama.So, another outstanding puzzle by what is clearly the best mass manufacturer of jigsaw puzzles in the world.
"I'm not much into puzzles, but I've been wanting to try some decent ones for quite some time.
Ever since reading Death Note and seeing Near's blank white puzzle, that's what I wanted to try.
But I figured, ""Let's try something easier first.
At least something with pictures.""
So that's why I ordered this puzzle.It's got the image of the very familiar Neuschwanstein (or the ""Disney castle""), and the brilliant colors make the pieces a wee bit easier to find.But man, I didn't know the pieces would be so small!
I realize it's to conserve table space and make the puzzle more challenging, but it's quite a shock for someone so new to puzzles, like me.It was a joy to build, though it probably took me longer than it would've others.
I've already two more Ravensburger puzzles, and yes, one is blank!"
If you are looking for a challenging puzzle than look no further.
I absolutely love Ravensburger puzzles not only because they are challenging and make you think but also for the wonderful quality.
The colors are bright and vivid thus making your work so much more precious when you finally finish and see the end result.
I am partial to the 1000 pc puzzles and like the 27x20 size as it fits on my card table without a problem.
Preciously cut pieces make this alot easier when getting deeply into a specific color.
All in all you get what you pay for and these are the best in my book.
Now that I've been up in the clouds with a beautiful castle it's time to try a waterfall on for size.
I like Ravensburger puzzles.
The pieces are sturdy and fit together well.
Also, pieces that aren't supposed to go together, do not fit together well.
There's no confusion or the need for serious contemplation to determine if pieces are in the right place or not.
The beautiful picture is bright and colorful, but with a matte finish so glare from overhead lights is not a problem.This particular scene was a fun one for our family.
The castle was the first part we put together because it was the easiest.
I thought the big patch of sky in the middle would be hard, but there was enough color variation that it wasn't very difficult.
The trees were the biggest challenge.
Although they are broken up by the castle, they account for close to half the puzzle and it was challenging to match the shades of green and yellowleaves to the correct tree.
We spent almost a week doing this puzzle, but I was the only one seriously dedicated to it and I spent about an hour a day.
I enjoy putting puzzles together and this is a good one.
