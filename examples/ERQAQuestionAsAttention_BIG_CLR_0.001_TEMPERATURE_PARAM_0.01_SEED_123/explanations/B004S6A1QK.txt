Reviews:
I have a two year old boy that has always enjoyed the type of toys that offer a ball and hover type products.
For the past year I have found that these type of products provide the opportunity to teach colors (when playing with the different color balls and calling out the color while inserting the ball into the toy).
I also found that the volume is a good level, so often these toys set the volume way to high.
The parts of the toy have been very durable and seem to be lasting well without any breakage thus far.
I am a very happy customer.Happy Shopping!
The Elephant as it is known in our house has quickly become one of our 11.5 month old daughter's favorite toys.
It is a well-designed air driven ball toy that is able to hold her interest for a long time.
And it is one of the toys she lets us know she wants to play with.What you get is a good sized plastic elephant.
You need to snap on the base and the ear piece.
You also need to install 4 D batteries (screwdriver needed) and then it is ready to go.
It comes with 5 different colored balls.
The ear piece contains 2 holes, one in each ear.
One leads to the belly of the elephant where your child can grab balls.
The other leads to the compartment where air is flowing through.
This forces the ball out of the snout.
You have 4 snout positions.
One will loop the ball back in the ear over and over.
The other positions are angled just enough to have the ball go out and roll away.We use these positions the most and some are pretty good at having the balls come in the same general direction.
This allows our daughter to crawl after the balls and/or act as a goal keeper.
The elephant plays different songs and they are surprisingly okay to listen to for an adult ear.
Our daughter likes them as well.
My daughter started playing with this toy as soon as I got it out of the box.
Even before the batteries were placed in it.
Then the real fun began.
With the batteries in, it quickly became her new favorite toy.
She makes a beeline for it the every morning.
The bright colors of the elephant are attractive to little ones.
Once snapped together, it is quite durable.
My daughter has a tendency, like most toddlers, to drag her toys around and then drop them on the hard tile floor.
This one has survived a few drops.
I am constantly searching for the balls as they like to disappear.
She quickly figured out that balls go in one spot and out the other.
She will put the balls in and quickly move so she can follow their path and watch them come out.Overall, we love this toy!
Pros- bright colors, teach cause and effect, easy on switchCons- plastic pieces were tricky to assemble, had to really snap them in with a lot of force, I guess that is good so that they are not easily removed by little ones, but it does make it hard to put together.
4D batteries are a lot.
we haven't drained any yet but have only played sporadically for 3 weeks.
The first ball gets stuck in the trunk of elephant.When you push the red button a fan powers up and music plays.
The play cycle only lasts 20 seconds.
One frustrating thing for my little guy is that the first ball usually gets stuck in the trunk and you have to help pop it out so that the rest of the balls can come out.
Once you get it going, it continuously pops the balls out for 20 seconds.
However, sometimes a ball gets stuck in the middle of the cycle.
So that kind of stinks.
The balls do have a tendency to go everywhere, even though it says you can angle the trunk in certain ways, that really is reliable.
I do think though, that can add to the fun.
Be prepared for balls to roll everywhere, under the tv, under the couch etc.
Make sure to set it up in a place where baby has lots of room and so that when the balls roll around he won't accidentally hurt himself reaching for them.
My little guy is still a little too young to chase after the plays and play with it himself, however he loves watching the balls pop out and it is only a matter of time until he will be chasing after the balls.
The Playskool Poppin Park Elefun Busy Ball Popper is a different type of toy that most kids will enjoy.
The Elefun is essentially a fan that blows balls up into the air either into the elephants ears where they are recirculated into the toy or into the room where your baby gets to play fetch.
You can slightly rotate the elephants trunk to help determine where you want the balls to go though it does tend to randomly vary the blower speed so the balls will shoot across your room from time to time.
The Elefun is easy to use and will amuse your kids for a while.
The downside is that the blower is rather loud so it is definitely not a toy to use before bedtime.
The toy does cycle every 20-30 seconds so it is unlikely that your kids will have any hearing damage from being around the fan noise.
*** Positive Points Include: ***- Randomly varies blower speed so kids cannot predict what happens.
This keeps kids entertained- Easy for kids to turn on and off and has main power switch so they don't accidentally turn it on when you dont want them to.- Very durable construction.
It has survived its share of drops and bumps- A pink version is available*** Negative Points Include: ***- Blower/ fan noise - kids get used to it over time but it is loud.
Fortunately the toy cycles off from time to time.- Uses D- size batteries; these are expensive to replace and not rechargeable.- No real learning but it is fun for the kids.- The balls will get scattered across your room so parents will need to help with the search and rescue from time to time.
My 3-year-old loves this toy, and she loves showing it to our 6-month-old.
I like that it appeals to a seemingly broad range ages from infants into toddlerhood and then some.
Overall, I think it's a really cute & fun toy.
It would make for an excellent gift for the 1-year-old or even maybe for a baby shower.It's an easy toy to set up and get going, although you will need to purchase your own D batteries, just a heads up.
As some other reviewers have pointed out, it is a somewhat noisy toy, but it comes with an off switch so I can't complain.
It provides some really good entertainment for the little ones who are endlessly charmed by the popping balls flying and floating around the elephant.
It's a pretty unique toy that way, throwing balls into the air.I'm hoping we don't lose any of the balls, it's not like the elephant works with just any ball, and they can easily run under the sofa and hide for a while, making this toy not as fun.
I wish there were settings to make the popping last longer, and your child has to quickly keep replacing the balls to keep them moving.
So even though the balls are easy to lose around the house, I wish they'd included more of them.I keep this toy closeted and pull it out when my girls need a distraction for a little while, it's good for that type of use.
And as I said, I think it makes a great gift for a little one.
Overall I can recommend it!
This toy looks great in the box.
Pretty straight forward to setup and use.
Ball's never seem to stay, some one has to chase and bring it back all the time.
I wish there was a easier setup where the balls could simply pop and fall back in a infinite loop.
After some time, the kids got bored.
It was fun for the first few hours and didnt hold any one interest after that.
Could be useful for very young toddlers.
I got this for my 8 month old and he really like to watch it and play with the balls that shoot out.
He hasnt really got the concept of putting them back in yet but I think he will figure it out pretty soon.
My other boys who are 5, 5, and 4 love to play with it as well.
They think it is pretty cool and try to help the 8 month old out.
I think they were more excited to check it out ehan some of the other toys that I had actually bought them recently.
the machine does stop after about 1 minute or so and doesnt go very long.
You have to keep hitting the start button quite often for this toy.
My 8 month old also pulls it over quite a bit which isnt a problem but it doesnt work as well on its side but he still likes it.
Overall a pretty good toy.
The reason I gave it four stars is that we had a different one for my older boys that was alot better and I think was more fun thatn this one.
"I have an 8-month old and a 23-month old and they are both huge fans of this toy.
It is well designed in its function and construction.
The picture can be somewhat deceiving, because it doesn't just simply recycle the ball continuously.
Instead the child has to get the ball out of the catch basket and put it back through the elephant (allowing for a very high level of interaction).
Both my girls were able to figure out how to operate the elephant almost immediately and are entertained each time they play with it.
The elephant occasionally spits the balls out onto the floor causing them to have to chase the balls (which has been helpful for their hand-eye coordination).In terms of education and entertainment value, this toy is great for younger children (0-3 yrs).
It also provides excellent playability compared to many other similar products in this market as interaction is more random (rather than just pushing a button and having a set action happen).There are a few downsides which I will mention, but I didn't feel  were really strong enough to lower the rating.
1)  The toy is moderately noisy so it's not something that can be played with if one child is taking a nap.
2)  The toy did not come with batteries and requires ""D"" cell batteries (although we've been playing with it for over a month now and it's still going strong).
3)  The balls tend to migrate away from the toy so you will spend a lot of time trying to find them and keep them in one place.
4)  The toy's footprint is rather large so it does make storage somewhat difficult.Overall, I think the Elefun Busy Ball Popper is a great toy.
It's safe and it keeps my kids occupied long enough for me to get to other chores."
This fun toy features a brightly colored elephant that is easy to assemble.
It is pretty sturdy and should stand up to standard infant and toddler abuse.The music is nice, but pretty loud (though not necessarily any louder than most of the other toys in our house), and there is not a volume control.
Note to toy manufacturers: always, always, put a volume control on children's toys (at least a low and high switch).The ball popping (more like gentle blowing than popping) action is fun, and you can somewhat control the direction with the trunk, which turns a full 360 degrees.
It is activated by a big red button that is easy to push, and it automatically shuts off after a short time.
The balls do not pop high into the air, but generally just above the snout.
They hover there and then fall back into different parts of the toy (or under the couch, table, or tv stand to join the other lost toys).
This should be fun for infants and toddlers and even older siblings.
Even for my five and seven year old kids!
I was expecting the popper to be more powerful than it is but I am glad it isn't!
It would be difficult if I had to go chasing after the balls every time my baby plays with this popper.
Ocasionally the balls do pop outside of the elephant but not so hard that my son would have to crawl very far after them.
The music is fun and I like that it does not continuously run, your child has to hit the red ball on the right side of the elephant in order to turn it on.
And like I said, my older kids enjoy playing with it as well!
This popper is absolutely adorable and - for the most part - my two year old LOVES it.
My big problem is that it's loud.
My little guy is also scared of loud noises, so as much as he loves it, every time he turns on the popper, he runs away in fear!
So it's set on automatic: turn on, run away, and then watch (from afar) as the balls go out the nose, into the ear, and back out the nose.
Thirty seconds or so go by, the music and blower stop, then run over, turn it on, and run away again...The fully automated mode isn't foolproof.
Sometimes the balls fly in unexpected directions.
That's fine though: it's a toy, not a piece of precision equipment.One special note: I've been extremely impressed at the durability and safety!
All sorts of things have been put in the elephant's nose and ear, and we've been able to get them out safely, and never had an injury from putting a little hand or finger where it shouldn't be.
"I've had this toy played with by children ranging from 9 months to 5+ years and granted, all had fun with it in their own way.
Here are the reactions9 month old - Initially scared by the sound.
Later got used to the toy and figured out how to push the red button and get the air to blow out of the elephant's snout.
Enjoyed putting her face in the snout and feeling the air blowing up her face.
Also enjoyed playing with the colorul little balls.
As it is, babies can't play with this by themselves because somebody has to be there to return the balls to popping position for them.2 year old - Enjoyed playing with the colored balls that came in the pack.
Was scared of the ""ball in air"" phenomena and did not play with the elephant much3 - 5 year olds - Enjoyed playing with the elephant itself.
It withstood a lot of banging and dropping.
They even sat on it and it held up.
They liked to sit on the snout and feel the air blowing up their skirt and shorts.
Also experimented with dropping things other than the ball into the snout to see if it would shoot outWhy the safety hazard?
- Well, the older kids drop all sorts of little toys in the snout and the baby wants to put her face in the snout and feel the air.
I dread a scenario where one of those plastic little toys inserted by the  older kids become a projectile, shoots out and hurts the baby in the face.This toy has it's fun part but I cannot overlook the danger it could pose when children of varying ages are playing with it.
Additionally, the music is annoyingly loud and there's no option of having the toy operate without music"
We've had ball poppers before than launch balls two feet into the air, where they roll under a couch and generally require a difficult retrieval.
In a way, that's kind of the fun with such toys, but this elephant was different... and we kind of liked it.Instead of launching the ball impossibly high in the air, the blower just makes the ball hover near the edge of the snout, where it usually rolls back into the elephants ears to either land in the slot in the tummy, or roll back into the blower area.Kids still need to interact with the toy to make anything happen, but it's not so out of control.At any rate, my two year old (and my three and four year olds) loved it!
The toy is colorful and appealing to little ones before it's even operated and it stays out on the shelf because it is cheerfully decorative in the bedroom.
I am again mentioning that I believe toys should come with at least inexpensive batteries required so that the item can be used from the start... this does not... 4 cheapest D batteries at wholesale cost would have added less than one dollar to the cost of this item... and what consumer wouldn't be willing to pay less than one dollar more for this item if it came with the required batteries.
It would generate such good will in consumers to have this consideration.
Upon operation the toy is a bit loud... but so many toys are I find... the lightweight balls are safe for little ones and should not do damage around the house.
Perhaps choosing a room where balls are not lost under furnishings will save you searching and reaching for them.
Some children will need more assistance in ball placement... but most will quickly master play with their new blue elephant friend.
It is fun for one... or several children to play with.
We give it 4 stars!
The first thing you will notice once you get this toy going is the SOUND!
Once I assembled it (fairly simple, with just a little snapping into place of plastic that always seems to take me a few tries) and inserted the 4 D batteries and turned it on, I thought something was broken, as I heard a loud, vacuum-cleaner like whine.
But I quickly realized that is just how it sounds.
The elephants trunk blows up a stream of air, like a reverse vacuum.
The 5 balls are supposed to be put in the elephant's ears, and then, depending on how you set the truck, they pop out and around the room, or pop back into the ears, or go into the stomach (I haven't had much luck making them do this)My daughter is autistic and developmentally delayed, and plays at about a 1-2 year level, although she is seven.
I am always on the lookout for toys that will interest her and that she can operate.
She very quickly learned to operate this one, except for turning the trunk, and seems to not mind the noise.
She doesn't usually put the balls into the ears, but puts them right into the trunk, where they are suspended in air if you don't touch them.
She likes looking at this, or pushing them down to watch them pop up.
It takes a lot for her interest to be held by a toy, but she played with this one about 10 minutes the first time she saw it, which is not bad.The balls will be a problem.
They are very lightweight, which they would have to be into order to float well, and to not bonk you on the head when they are flying around, but like anything that gets tossed around a room, which these will more than most, I am pretty sure they will be lost.
And I can see it being tempting to try to substitute something else for them, which I am sure is not a good idea, and I can also see most kids trying other things in the tempting air-blowing hole, with the predictable problems that will bring.Overall, an interesting idea for a toy.
I think a young toddler could learn to use it pretty well, and would be interested in it for a bit anyway, if you can stand the noise and the balls hiding all over your house!
My first baby had the Playschool Busy Ball Popper and the Ball-tivity center, and he played with both endlessly.
So I guessed that my 5 month old baby might like this even more because of the fun shape.My 6 month old does love it, but she isn't the only one who squeals and laughs.
My 3 year old loves to play with us, reloading balls (though his hand gets stuck in the cupped bit at the bottom if he tries to put his whole hand around a ball and pull it out) and running after them when they don't go into the ears.THE GOOD- The balls go into the ears about 60% of the time.
This is better than the Busy Ball Popper as it is often mommy who goes chasing after the balls.
I make sure I put it in a corner in the playroom because when it's brought into the living room the balls end up under the couch, under the TV stand, etc.- The red button that starts the air and music is easy to press.- The variations in where the balls go make this a lot more fun than other ball poppers.THE OK- Assembly wasn't too bad but you do have to put some muscle into it!The two kids really have a good time with this and I know as the baby gets older she'll continue to have even more fun (beyond giggling and watching in fascination and intermittently playing with the balls my 3 year old hands to her).
Sorry dear elephant, your fun just wan't that memorable!
This toy looked like a blast, but like many other reviews here, we were ultimately disappointed.
I will echo some of the same experiences: this toy is noisy, it's under powered, and it's frankly just not that exciting.
If the air was powerful enough to blow the balls higher up into the air, it would be more fun.
And it seems like it should be with how loud it is.
Or, if the balls actually went into the ears and kept cycling, then it would be more fun, but alas, they do not.
My kids (1 and 3) were so excited to play with this, but lost interest within 10 minutes.We actually just ended up using the balls from this toy to add to our Explore and Grow Tumble N Twirl which uses the same balls ( http://www.amazon.com/Playskool-Explore-Grow-Tumble-Twirl/dp/B001WRSER6/ref=sr_1_16?s=toys-and-games&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1337201610&sr;=1-16 ).
My sister also has the Musical Activity Ball and Gear Center ( http://www.amazon.com/Playskool-Musical-Activity-Ball-Center/dp/B003CRJU0Y/ref=sr_1_8?s=toys-and-games&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1337201610&sr;=1-8 ) which we can use these balls for instead.
And there are several other busy ball products that are much more fun!
