Top sentence(s):
If you finish the first card and don't make any mistakes (the other players are watching carefully to make sure) you knock it all down and grab another card and build what's on it, continuing until the time runs out.
We have a closet full of games that get pulled out occasionally, but since we received Make n Break they're all just gathering dust.
However, I think you can modify this game for children even a little younger, perhaps 5-6.
They got past it though and thoroughly loved this game.
Specifically: roll a die, set a timer, pull an object card, build!

Reviews:
I read several reviews before ordering the adult version of this game instead of the junior version.
We played this game with my 6 and 8 year old daughters.
They quite enjoyed it.
My 4 year old wasn't able to do the cards though and the speed of the turns didn't allow me to work as a team with him.
One reviewer said her 4 year old played the game--but my son definitely couldn't.Pros:  Critical thinking, challenging for both adults and kids, not too long, durable pieces, involves both skill and luck, easy for kids to understandCons:  None.
My girls did knock down the blocks pretty forcefully though when starting the next card, so I would recommend playing it on the floor or on a table that can take a beating.If you're looking for a fun family game, I'd definitely recommend this one.
I do think that if you had more than 4 people playing, it would feel like it was a long time between your turns though.
I'm so glad to add this game to our family collection!
What a fun game!
Roll the die, set the timer to the number rolled, pick a card, & build the corresponding picture with the 10 wooden building blocks before the timer goes off.
I play a modified version with my 4 yo.
We ignore the timer and have fun building what's on the pic.
Great for hand eye coordination and fine motor skills.
Develops logical thinking and patience.
We also enjoy just using the blocks to teach addition and subtraction.
The wood is sturdy and the colors are bright.
We love it!
"My kids LOVE this game and so do I!
It requires thought and hand eye coordination, while still being fun.
My middle daughter has some learning disabilities and this game is great for her.
The basic premise of the game is to pick a card, build the figure on the card with the correct colors before the timer goes off.
My older daughter is 11 and is probably approaching the age where some kids might find it ""boring,"" but she still wants to play it when offered.
I'm very pleased with this simple, yet fun and educational game."
I played this game with my James, we are competitive but not jerks about it so games like this are good for our brains!You have all these pieces of colored wood, a timer, cards depicting various ways to stack those pieces.
You get a certain amount of time to complete as MANY cards as you can in that time.
It is not easy, and in between you must bust apart your creation and start again..if you have a hard surface that gets so loud!It makes you have to use your hands quickly, as well as your brain to understand how the cards want you to set up, I could see people using this as a therapy.
"We have one child (age 9) so we got the full version (not Junior).
The game is easy to learn and pretty fun.
It is great for hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, sensory awareness, etc - would be a good game for an OT to have.
There were some mildly irritating things about the game.
If you read Debra's review, where she explains why she prefers the ""junior"" version, she pretty much nails it.
It feels more like ""solitaire"" and it is boring for the person who is waiting their turn.
The timer is loud and annoying."
"I'm not sure how much fun this would be for a group of adults playing, but I played this game with my 6-year old son and absolutely loved it.
You role the dice which has a 1,2 or 3 and you have to set the timer to the number you role.
In the time you have, you turn over cards that have pictures of formations using the colored blocks that you have to recreate.
Some cards are colored and you have to use the correct colored block and some aren't colored and you can use whatever color you wish.
The formations on the cards vary from relatively easy to very complicated and you have to put the formations together as quickly as you can and then try to do another.This game is absolutely outstanding for a young kid.
I have a son that is addicted to videogames and I'm challenged everyday to make sure he uses his mind in different ways.
""Make 'N' Break"" is perfect for this.
It not only teaches him to associate colors and shapes, but to stack them and build them with speed.
It teaches eye-hand coordination, mixed with speed and most importantly observation.
In a short amount of time, you have to observe, and do it correctly.This is a perfect game for my son and I.
Although I found that it made things fair to not role the dice and give him 3 on the counter everytime, and me just 1.
I've had this game for about a week and I think we've played it everyday but one."
What a great family game or a super exciting indoor recess game for school.
My family (ages 6, 10, 37, and 39) love to play this.
Any friend my children has had over to play requests this game to their parents when they return home.
It's simple and fun!
The organized box includes 10 building blocks, a timer ticking per the number you rolled & a card showing you what to build in that time.
Basically it involves flipping a card and building the structure on the card.
You get tokens as you build.
Specifically: roll a die, set a timer, pull an object card, build!
Total the points for builds, switch players, and do it all again three more times.
A typical game lasts about 15-25 minutes.
My 10 year old is a big fan of building with Legos; thus this was right up his alley.
My six-year-old daughter enjoys playing this game with her big brother.
What a great gift this will make for their friends or for the classroom.
I envision this also being used in a children's therapy session to work on fine motor skills.
"The idea behind this game is about as simple as it gets.
Set the timer, flip a card, and use the blocks to build the structure shown on that card.
When you're done, move to the next card and repeat until the timer goes off.
And it's that simplicity that makes this such a perfect game for the whole family.My wife and I play this with our five and eight-year-old daughters, and everyone enjoys the game.
You're supposed to roll the dice to figure out how much time each player gets on their turn, but for those with young kids (like us) you can simply allow the kids more time to level the playing field a little.
It's a great way to teach kids some fine motor skills, and to improve their spatial awareness.
And even for those of us who are well beyond childhood, the game is incredibly enjoyable.
It's a great way to stay sharp, and to work on dexterity.The only possible improvement is one I've seen mentioned by others, and that would be the addition of some more ""advanced"" cards for those who find the game too easy after repeated plays.
If some additional blocks and those advanced game cards were available, it would make for a nice next step up for advanced players.
Regardless, this is a great game for the whole family."
We ended up with both the regular and junior version and I have to say that my husband and I enjoyed the junior version way better (even after the kids had gone to bed).This version requires a lot of waiting.
You roll the dice, set the timer to 1, 2 or 3 and try to build with blocks to copy as many cards as possible.
I found the randomness of how much time you get kind of frustrating.
I definitely prefer games with less randomness and more skill.
It's frustrating if your opponent gets more time than you.
Basically it's a solitaire game you can play with other people.The components are quality Ravensburger (except for the timer which is kind of chincey).
The only kind of weird thing is that one block is almost black, but is actually a navy purple color.
The card shows the block as purple and that kind of threw me at first, but my work involves work with color and most people probably wouldn't notice.Basically, I found this game boring.
The Junior version is much faster paced, involves competition, is more equitable, etc.
Don't waste your time with this one!
"Ravensburger's ""Make `N' Break"" is a game that everyone can enjoy.
Recommended for ages 8 and older, this is a game everyone will be challenged by and will enjoy.
Fast paced and involving active participation, ""Make `N' Break"" requires no reading skills and is a game that adults can also play with younger children as soon as the child is able to understand taking turns.Constructed of high quality materials, ""Make `N' Break"" should last through hours of play.
The colorful wooden building blocks are smoothly finished and evenly painted.
The wooden die, rather than a plastic one, is a nice touch.
Sturdy cardboard scoring tokens and building cards complete the components of this game that are actively used in play.
Even the box which contains ""Make `N' Break"" is constructed of sturdy cardboard and is finished nicely.A plastic timer may be the one weak point of this game.
Not only does the timer make a most annoying grinding noise as it ""counts"" down, but it does not always tick off the same amount of time with each use.
Attempts at checking the timer with a stopwatch yielded various results when starting at either ""1"" or ""2"" and only on ""3"" were the results somewhat consistent since the timer had a stopping point at that number.
At the other two designations, the timekeeper had to try to stop the arrow on the appropriate line.
I recommend using a kitchen timer to prevent competitive individuals from arguing they did not have the same amount of time to build that their opponent had.
Based on my experience, the times for building are about 60 seconds if one rolls ""3,"" 45 seconds for a ""2,"" and 30 seconds for a ""1"".Ravensburger's ""Make `N' Break"" is a game you should consider for yourself as well as for others who like playing ""old fashioned"" games.
Those who enjoy game nights with family or friends will want to add ""Make `N' Break"" to their game collection."
Both my boys loved this game.
Having the timer makes it more exciting.
The dice roll decides the time, so there is some chance to it.
The blocks are solid wood and very sturdy.
It is a simple yet fun game that I even enjoyed playing.
I had two small complaints though but they aren't worthy of knocking off any stars.
1) the arrow on the timer knobs is very hard to see, and 2) The video that is depicted with this set, is for a completely different set, so my sons initially had a bit of dissapointment that there were no prongs to pick up and build the blocks with, as were shown in the video.
They got past it though and thoroughly loved this game.
This Make 'N' Break game is a lot of fun.
The basic premise is that you assemble a figure made of colored blocks based on a picture on cards.
The range of structures goes from simple to quite complicated, and there are some that need to have colors match up and others where just getting blocks in the right arrangement is sufficient.
The game is also timed, to add some intensity to it.
I found that my five-year-olds have had a really fun time with it (and my two-year-old can even play a long a bit as well).
First, as a general comment, the basic game is fun enough for adults to enjoy.
It makes for a pretty quick play, but I could even see doing it with only adults.
But where this game really shines is with kids.
It is very easy to modify the rules to suit the level your kids are at.
For instance, the first time we played, we didn't have them match colors, but only get blocks in the right arrangement, and I pulled out the most difficult cards so they only had easier structures to build.
Plus we each only did one structure per turn, so there wasn't much time pressure.
But the second time we played, we added the color-matching in, and they took it right in stride.
Likewise, we've now added the roll of the dice so they may get less time to build (when we've played, I've always taken the shortest amount of time on the timer, to help make it more fair), and we've even made the transition to building as many structures as you can during your time limit.
It's been fun to watch their coordination and balancing skills develop.
Some of the more difficult structures must be built in just the right order for the various blocks to couterbalance to avoid the whole structure falling apart while you're building, and it's been great to watch them work this problem out as they build.
There can occasionally be some frustration when they run out of time or have trouble with a structure, but that's a good learning experience too.
The reason this game interested me was because it was one the whole family could enjoy.
Both my kids (8 and 5) enjoy math and puzzle games and I really liked that this game helps reinforce logical and spatial reasoning.
The nice thing about this game is that it has different levels of difficulty so the whole family can play.
The game says 8+, but my 5 year old does fine with the game.
We really enjoy this game.
Like most Ravensburger products that I have experienced, this game is very good quality.
The simple concept of this game make it easy to learn even for the younger players.
I played this game with my 6 year old daughter and she was able to pick it up and hold her own with the older players.
I think it is an excellent game for teaching attention to detail (on most cards you will need to stack the blocks in a certain pattern with specific colors in specific spots).
It definitely gets the brain working while having a lot of fun.
I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a fast paced, semi-educational game the whole family can enjoy.
This game is unbelievably simple to learn: roll a die, set a timer, turn over a card and start building.
After opening the box, my 5 and 7-year-old and I were playing in less than 5 minutes.
The beauty of this game is that you can play it according to the rules or make some modifications to play with younger children.
You may want to give children under the age of 8 more time to build, or the easier cards.
Likewise, adults playing with children need less time or more challenges.
I see this as a game that becomes even more fun to play as my kids get older.Because there's an element of luck in rolling the die and shuffling the cards, no two games are ever alike.
You only play 4 rounds to determine a winner, so games are long enough to be fun, but not so long that they're frustrating or tiring.An excellent game for learning how to copy patterns build from a plan.
Like any good educational game, it's makes learning fun.
I was a little skeptical at first.
I tend to love the classic board games.
But this was actually really fun!
It was original and interactive.
And even my husband, who really hates board games of all varieties, seemed to enjoy it!This is a great family game and would be an awesome addition to any family game night.
I think it would also make an excellent family gift, so long as the children in the family are old enough.I would highly recommend this game!
This game requires a die to be cast which varies the amount of time a player has to complete builds utilizing brightly colored wooden blocks, according to randomly drawn cards.
The blocks are all the same shape and size, and the builds are relatively easy to get correct, but the time limit only permits so many cards to be copied in a given turn.
Don't attempt to build on a rug, even if it is low pile!
A flat, smooth, surface that doesn't wiggle is best.Some cards have very simple structures to be copied: such as orange placed vertically over horizontal dark green with a yellow rod on top to make a sort of capital I.
Others require all ten blocks to be included and these elaborate builds earn more points.
Color cards must be followed to the letter-for instance, the dark green and light green must not be confused.
Black and white cards give the builder freedom to use any color blocks, but at least one builder found that to be MORE of a challenge!
This game was very fast to learn and engaged players form age 7 to adult.
If competition seems unbalanced, I would suggest the simple modification of always giving the most able player the lowest timer setting and/or the least able player the highest timer setting.
The educational value is obviously in spatial relations and the game is quite durable, with the possible exception of the mechanical timer, which might not hold up over time.
This is a fun family game that emphasizes the physical as well as the mental.
You put things together and how much time you have depends on the roll of the dice.
And, there are enough pieces and variations of the moves that it will stay fresh for a long time without the family getting tired of it.
"This is the perfect family game.
It is easy enough for all ages, yet challenging enough to be fun for the adults as well as the kids.
You pick a card, then you have try to build what you see on the card with the colored blocks provided, within a certain amount of time.
It is not so hard that younger players can not play, yet it is not so easy that it bores adults.
Each game does not take so long that you save the game for ""later"", yet if you have the time it will certainly keep the whole family engaged for hours.
You can have as little as two and as many as four players and this is good too.
Some games in which you need four players end up played less often.
The fact that you are timed makes it more of a challenge of course, but it also adds to the excitement.
As the timer is about to go off the players start to get excited, nervous, and sometimes loud!
It is interesting to see that it's a matter of perception and hand eye coordination and sometimes the youngest player can easily beat an older one.
You have to be good at being able to see something, and replicate it, and work well under pressure.
I find that it helps children and adults work on these skills that can be quite important, yet work as an equalizer to make the game fun."
"I am a parent that LOVES playing this game, because it's pretty uncomplicated without being annoying.
It's challenging without being bogged-down by strategy and too many rules.
I never thought I'd like anything other than the simple, classic games that I played as a kid.
This is the game that I choose over others to play with my children.
It's built well, helps with hand-eye coordination and I don't have to write down the points accrued.Each person takes a turn rolling a die that is  1, 2 or 3 to show which setting the timer will start (1 is the least, with three being the highest).
There's a start and stop button on the timer.
You hold the ""stop"" button down and turn to the correct numbered setting (arrow on setting is the same color, only raised-I think I will put a dot of white-out on it to enable us to see this better, to avoid dispute of whether it was set on the right number).Next, player flips over a card and ""start"" button is pressed to begin the countdown.
You must arrange 10 thick blocks (much thicker and larger than Jenga blocks) of different colors in a formation determined by the picture on the card.
Some cards show all-white blocks, so are their arrangements are naturally easier, since you don't have to place those by color.Once you arrange a correct pattern, you draw another card and build new structure as fast as you can.
Your objective is to form as many configurations as you can before the timer runs out.At the sound of the buzzer, you count up the different numbers on the cards (1 being easiest-3 being for the harder structures).
You are awarded cardboard ""coins"" for each point, then the next person takes a turn.
Everyone gets four turns before tabulating the total coins each one has-the person with the most points wins.I cannot praise this game enough-it's really fun for the ENTIRE family.
The point assignment based on difficulty makes it easier to tailor the game for smaller kids by removing the harder cards (the 3s) or giving the 3s to the adults, 2s to the slightly older kids and adjusting or eliminating the scoring altogether.We appreciate that every aspect of this game appears to be well-made.
The ""coins"" are heavy carboard and even the box is the thickest, most durable box I have EVER seen for a boardgame-very impressive, since I really don't like how the other ones we have tend to split at a corner or two after some time is spent opening and closing.I don't forsee getting tired of this game at all.
I was talking to my son about how it reminds me of playing Tetris in a way, until he showed me another Ravensburger game on Amazon that appears to be an even greater challenge (for those who want that), and is even MORE like Tetris:Ravensburger Make 'N' Break Extreme Family GameAnyway, this is simply great fun and not too hard or frustrating to enjoy over and over with various ages."
This is a simple to learn, fun game for the whole family; especially, if you handicap the older, more experienced folk.There are 10 different colored, rectangular blocks.
From a stack of 80 cards or block designs, you're given a structure to build in about a minute or so.
A push button timer allows one of 3 options of time based on the role of the die.
It emits a nice grating buzz as time escapes you, and you attempt to complete your building and as many as possible.
You get points for success, doled out in tokens of 1 or 10's.
Each player gets a turn and after 4 turns, the one with the most points win.Simple enough.
The cards have various shapes of varying degrees of difficulty.
Some require that you build it according to color scheme as well as design.
Eats up more time.It's a game our whole family plays.
It states ages 8-99, but our 6 year old plays as well as our 8 year old, and you can handicap the more capable players by separating the cards into 2 piles bassed on a color code and difficulty.
The instructions also provide a version for expert builders, like me, where one can pass or reject cards to other players and force them to deal with it.We like it a lot.
One does get better with practice fairly quickly.
Just like when we were toddlers!
"Ravensburger usually has some great games, so I was excited about getting this game for my game-loving 6 year old.
(And although it says 8+, it's really fine for the younger crowd-- he played with another 6 year old and her 4 year old sister without much problem.)
The game is kind of simple but has a lot of potential-- the builder gets a card and has to recreate the picture that is on the card, and he gets a set amount of time to do it.
The cards can be pretty easy to make with the blocks, but they get harder, and children might struggle to get their ""building"" to stay up.
My son has also has enjoyed playing a more ""solitaire"" version of the game, and either using the cards to make his own towers or to see what he could build on his own.
If your child has frustration issues (mine does), they might get upset if their buildings fall down, but that is part of the fun of the game.
All in all, a good addition that can be fun for friends and family."
This is a good family game.
The recommended age is 8+, but my grandsons, 5 and 7, both enjoyed it.
My husband and I did too.
The boys love to build things, they're big Lego fans, and this game was perfect for them.
It's well made.
Two thumbs up.
We have a closet full of games that get pulled out occasionally, but since we received Make n Break they're all just gathering dust.
This game is SO.
MUCH.
FUN!My kids read the directions and in five minutes had it set up and were playing on their own.
It comes with about 10 differently colored rectangular building blocks, a stack of cards, a timer, and cardboard chips with point values on them.
Easy set up, easy clean up, which is always a bonus.You simply roll the dice to see how long your turn will be, set the timer to that amount, and then when the time starts you flip over the top card and attempt to build the structure pictured on the card.
Sometimes they are easy, with only three blocks, and sometimes they are towers of balancing craziness that send the builder into a frenzy trying to complete it.
If you finish the first card and don't make any mistakes (the other players are watching carefully to make sure) you knock it all down and grab another card and build what's on it, continuing until the time runs out.
However many cards you complete gives you your points for the round and you get a token that represents how many points you have.
Whoever has the most points at the end of four rounds wins.The instructions say that a game is four rounds, but you could set any number of rounds that you wish.
The instructions also say it's for 2-4 players, but I see no reason why you couldn't play with as many people as you want.
We frequently play with 5 to 6 people and it just makes the game last a little longer.
And lastly, the instructions say it's for ages 8 and up, but my 5-year-old plays happily with us and we just give him a little handicap on the points.
It's rare to find a game that adults and kindergarteners can equally enjoy, but Make n'Break does it.My only complaint is that the crash of pushing over the tower of blocks is so loud my husband and I can't have Make 'N' Break tournaments after the kids are in bed.
My kids were already familiar with Ravensburger Make'N'Break Family Game before we played it at home.
Apparently one of their teachers has it in her classroom and I can see why.Make 'N'Break:-rules are easy to follow and explain-took under 30 minutes for a family of 5 to play.-builds hand-eye coordination-builds dexterity-is fun for both boys and girls (But I have to admit that my Lego loving boy was a bit more enthusiastic about this game then my girls)-parts are made wellThe product description says that game is for 8 and up.
However, I think you can modify this game for children even a little younger, perhaps 5-6.
"Make 'N' Break is a good game for children and adults.
However, it feels more like an activity than what is traditionally viewed as a game.
That's not a bad thing - not at all.
It's just that it's not really a game where players will say ""let's play that again!""
There isn't any strategy.
It's all about being able to build the blocks in the pattern shown on the cards as fast as you can.
It's fun for about about 30 minutes and then you'll want to move on to something else.The timer and the focus on trying to finish as many cards as possible is where it's at for the adults.
Others have commented about wishing there were harder cards.
Not sure how that would work with just simple blocks.
There's already an ""extreme"" version of this game that probably fits that bill.
And speaking of other versions, there's a junior version of this game that I suspect is really intended to be played between only kids.
Kids can play this regular version just fine.
The issue is more for the adults - there's not a ton of meat here for the adults to chew on so definitely go with this version if you have both adults and kids playing.The one really great thing about this game is the ability to make it harder for the better or older players and easier for the younger ones.
You can divide up the cards to make it so that some people get the harder cards or the easier cards.
That's the sign of a great family game since it can even the playing field without forcing adults to purposely lose.I give the game 4 stars for all these reasons.
It's not even close to a personal favorite, but I can definitely see its value as a family game/activity.Edit, March of 2013: Recently played a game called La Boca by KOSMOS Games which is basically a team version of this game.
I love this game!
My husband and I are competitive and he can't seem to dethrone the reigning champion... :)  Our kids are aged 10, 8 and 6 and get in on the competition as well.
It is a very simple set up with virtually no rules.
There is a small timer where you roll the single die and see if you will get to put the timer on the 1,2 or 3 (3 being the longest time).
Someone mans the mini timer and you pick cards off the top of the deck and build the image.
Sometimes you must match the brick colors and other times it will be easy because you can stack any colors; just match the shapes.
The object of the game is to quickly build the shapes accordingly and move to the next card.
Each shape will have a point value.
When the timer dings for your round, an adult can add up all the cards that you have completed.
Then you receive chips in your amount to hold until the end of the game.
It is simple but such fun and it gets your mind working.Our 6 year old was able to play along.
At times he would get frustrated and nervous but he was still able to play along.Highly recommend because the whole family can play and it can be a short or long game.
Finally, it makes your mind work.
This can be taken to adult parties.
Virtually no set up and simple rules.
It's a hit for all!
