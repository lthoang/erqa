Top sentence(s):
I like that it plays music and talks and after the baby drops the ball in the slot, the baby has to find it under the shoes, so it's a way more fun way to play peek a boo.
But for short bursts or if I need five minutes without a kid, I'll stick this in front of them and it keeps them busy.
Not a good idea.
Good for teaching matching colors and numbers.
It does not - you drop the balls in.

Reviews:
The concept of this toy is to drop the ball in one of two holes, then guess which shoe it lands under.
The octopus gives hints and asks questions (but don't trust her!
She's usually incorrect!)
She plays music and speaks.
The song counts up to 8 and the octopus talks about numbers and colors.When we first got this, my little one didn't care much for the toy, but he loves the balls!
His older sisters took over playing with the octopus, and just watched where the ball dropped through the semi-transparent body, then lifted up that shoe.
The octopus talks and sings and asks questions--unfortunately, she doesn't always give the right answers.We still get out the octopus occasionally, but we play with the colorful plastic balls everyday!
They are the perfect size for little hands.
This seemed like a really smart idea for teaching kids numbers, colors, etc., but the design really ruins it.My first issue: you drop a ball into the top of the octopus, and it falls into one of the shoes.
The problem is, unless you release the ball very gently, it comes flying out from under whichever shoe it lands inside.
Secondly, this thing has pretty shoddy construction.
It looks sturdy in the photos, but in reality it's light and flimsy.
It tips over very easily, and the shoes tend to fall off.I think on the whole LeapFrog is a reliable company, but they dropped the ball (no pun intended) on this one.
I mean, as a couple of other reviewers have mentioned, why in the world would a company geared toward education design a seven-legged octopus (emphasis on the otco part)?
This is a dud.I would pass.
The peek-a-shoe octopus is cute, but the sound quality is very bad- I am not sure that my daughter even realized those were words!
Also, the balls dont fit in the storage area, so it is hard to not lose them.
On the other hand, it is adorable to look at, and dropping in the balls is fun, but overall, the sound was so bad that it really took away from the toy.
This toy is bright and colorful, with balls to put in the Octopus's hat and arms - they then come out in the different shoes.
Don't expect this to teach your child any colors or numbers, but it will keep them entertained for a period of time.If your child leans on this, it will tip over backwards.
It's better to play with it on the kitchen floor or on a kid table than on carpet.
I am fond of Leap Frog products and this one is good for young kids, but it's not high on the educational scale - even though it talks.
Thankfully, you can turn it off and baby can play in peaceful silence as well.
My daughter loved this toy even before I put batteries in it.
When she puts the ball in the top, it can come out through any of the 5 feet.My biggest complaint; the feet come off WAY too easily.
It seems that every time she plays with it, I am putting feet back on at least 10 times in as many minutes.
In addition, the area to hold the balls when they aren't in use only holds 3 balls.
The toy comes with 5.Overall it is cute and fun, I just wish the feet stayed on better.
*EDIT*  The more we play with it, the easier the feet come off.
To the point that it is seriously annoying.
My daughter will pull them off just trying to look underneath for the ball.
Not pulling hard, just lifting to to look.
She isn't playing rough.
In my opinion, a toy designed for children this young should hold up to a bit more play and not come apart so easily.
I love that you can change that sound to quiet or loud.
I hate the loud toys that sound like they are using a loud speaker.
Those toys don't last very long at our house!!
The quiet side is perfect!My son loves it!
He sat in the floor dancing to the music.
It has great educational value, too.
It teaches colors, numbers, counting, and sea animals.
My son is going through a stage where he doesn't want to share, so we're using this as an opportunity to teach sharing.
You drop the ball through one of two spots, and then you have to figure out which foot it's under.
He has to wait for his turn to drop the ball.It's just really cute, too!
;)
My 3 and 1/2 year old really liked this toy when I got it for him and I appreciate how it had different modes and helps teach him colors and numbers and it's fun for him to guess which shoe the ball is under and all that.
However the shoes come off pretty easy and the balls are easily misplaced in the sea of toys, so keeping it all together has become the biggest challenge for me.
If the balls had a better holding area and the shoes didn't come off as easily I would have given this 5 stars, but those two things make it less ideal for me so I am only giving it 4.
It is fun and educational though and if you are good at keeping track of all of the pieces it may not be an issue and there are not really small pieces I worry about him choking on or anything, it's just with hundreds of different toys scattered across 4 or 5 different rooms, finding all the pieces to play with this is getting increasingly difficult over time.
This is fun, if you treat it like a toy and not an educational device.
As other reviewers have noted, the product sometimes gives the wrong answers and really struggles unless it is on a level surface.
Although it is lightweight, the main unit seems strong enough.
The little shoes, however, fly off with any level of impact.
Also, the way the shoes attach to the main unit seem destined to fail eventually because the shoes attach with little plastic nubs.The main Amazon picture makes this thing look as though it shoots the balls out of the top.
It does not - you drop the balls in.
Also - I'd be surprised if a 9 month old got much use out of this.
My son, at 21 months, totally understood the concept, but I'm not sure if a child under 12 months would really get it.
Peek-A-Shoe Octopus requires 2 AA batteries that not included to satisfy excitement at unpacking.
The list of its functions and educational purposes is impressive.
Its mechanics works, but it is obviously quite sensitive to shocks.
The toy is pleasing aesthetically.
It tends to fall back, so a good place to play with it would be at a wall or inside a crib.
The manufacturer could have made such a suggestion.
The shoes do not withstand aggressive pulling and the parents should be advised to instruct children not to pull when frustrated by an unexpected result of a try.
An external 5 ball storage on the back would be nice.
Otherwise the toy is fine and quite innovative.
My grand daughter loved just putting in the balls.
She didn't care if I had gotten the shoes on.
When I did get a chance to put the shoes on it did make it harder for her to find the balls but that is part of the game.
I love that the shoes hold the balls into the shoot so when I am moving the toy the balls are not dropping everywhere.
The next day we got around to the batteries.
I can't say she liked the toy more with songs.
She was still happy dropping balls in and looking for them under the shoes.
I guess as she gets older the counting and color matching part of the game will be interesting to her.
I like a toy she can grow into.
I do have to hunt for balls sometime but so far we have kept up with all 5.
We have had play dates with other 2's and the toy has held up well.
I do have to put the shoes back on every so often but not hard to do.
This new toy, intended for children ages 9 months to 5 years,seems to hold the kid's attention, for at least the expected attention span, especially with its bright colors and musical tunes provided.
The item comes in a nice colorful box, which seems to have some appeal to the youngster.
The main concept involves dropping a ball and looking for it under the brightly-colored, numbered shoes, and pressing the collar to add music to the mix.
5 balls are enclosed, which can be stored handily inside the octopus.
The whole package comes in a very sturdy, colorful carton.
It sells for around $ 30.00, and will old the kid's attention through a number of play times !
Our two year old loves this toy.
It has great educational value and actually keeps her attention for more than 3 minutes - quite the accomplishment!
The balls are a little hard to keep track of, but overall a great product!
By far, this is the favorite toy my daughter received for her birthday.
At one year old, she loves recovering the disappearing balls.
The balls are inserted into one of two top slots only to be hidden in one of the five feet.
Teaching colors and numbers, the toys is educational, despite the octopus only having five feet.
The question of durability is only raised because of how easily the feet pull off of the main toy.
I antipate the notches on the feet will eventually break.
All things considered, my one year old has gotten hours of fun out of this toy already.
I would certainly recommend it.
"After reading some of the reviews for this toy, I wasn't sure what to expect.
After setting it up, my 14 yo daughter and I played with it and got kinda rough with it, much like my grandson might.
Yes, it tipped over but not with ""normal"" play.
And if it tips over, just set it back up.
A toddler will be able to turn over most any toy!
As far as educational, I give it 5 stars!
It teaches colors, numbers, helps with eye to hand co-ordination, and has some catchy tunes.
It is brightly colored and inviting for any child.This is a toy I would definitely recommend.
I am saving this for a Christmas gift for my grandkids.
I know they will enjoy it!"
We bought this for our 13 month old grandson, and he loves it.
His sister, age 4, also loves it.
You drop a ball in the top and then try to find it under one of the feet.
It teaches numbers and colors and plays catchy songs.
Seemed very durable.
Bright colors and cute music made it a big hit with the toddler set.
It kept his attention for quite awhile and he kept going back to it.
I think he will play with this one a lot.
Well worth buying.
I mean, seriously, he has plastic balls in his shoes!
That has to hurt, doesn't it?
Why would anyone smile about that?Thankfully, this condition is something your child can correct.
My toddler took to the Peek-A-Shoe Octopus right away, dropping the balls in and searching for them in the shoes.
In fact, all our children (the others being five and six) have had a crack at it.Solid construction, bright colors, and easy to assemble.
Auto shutoff is a nice bonus feature.
(I wish every toy did that!
)It is doubtless one of those toys that your pre-schooler with play with a bit every day.
Plus, you get that initial cute moment when he puts his eye up to the top hole to see where the ball has gone.The Peek-A-Shoe is a toy that should be a part of every toddler's toybox.
** Update 05/22/12 ** One thing I thought I should address with this toy are the shoes themselves.
As other reviewers have noted, they do pry off fairly easily (especially after repeated use).
There is no real danger from this, since the shoes are too big to be ingested.
Still, when your toddler figures it out, you'll probably end up putting them back on frequently.On a positive note, after seven months, it is one of those toys that our now-almost-two-year-old still plays with on occasion.
"Not having kids of my own, I tend to buy Leap Frog products as gifts for the children in our extended family since I had thought that their focus was on educational items.
This product seemed to encourage counting and it does do that, but the product itself is not very sturdy and the shoes come off easily.
I picked this out for my nephew, who just turned two, and it also seems to be a bit too ""young"" for him, even though the recommended age group is 9-36 months.
I think that this would be better for the 12-18 month range.Overall, a cute toy!"
My children liked playing with this toy, but they definitely don't play with it the way it was intended to use for any of the educational functions to work.
It would be tough for most children to wait long enough between either dropping the balls in or trying to find them to actually listen to the toy talk about the color or number of the shoe lifted.
The shoes fall off easily, the balls were lost shortly, and the music and sounds of the toy are very annoying.
This is not a toy I want to keep around.
Some of the older LeapFrog toys are better for educational purposes (like the alphabet bus and baby tad)...and the Playschool?
Ball Popper was way more fun for everyone and more durable as far as a ball toy goes.
I gave this toy to my 15 month old grandson and I think he's the perfect age for this toy.
He really loves it.
He is a fan of peek-a-boo at this period and I think he gets a kick out of finding the little ball  It is his go to toy right now when he arrives each morning.
Things that I like:  the batteries are screwed in, so that he can't take them out and put them in his mouth, a problem with other toys.
The sound can be adjusted, and will turn off if left for a while.
It has a few different modes, and the baby likes the music.
It is colorful and cute.
"Adorable Peek A Shoe Octopus!
My daughter of 15 months is enjoying this toy by LeapFrog.
There are 3 modes of play, color, music and counting.
The octopus has a bunch of shoes that are numbered and each speak their number out loud.
Each shoe lifts up ""peek-a-boo"" with the balls underneath.
She really enjoys dropping the balls into the octopus.
Its great hand-eye coordination and motor skills at this age.
There are 5 balls in all and they all can be stored inside the octopus though they usually end up all over the place here.
He has a collar that plays music too on him.This toy is an award winner and I have had many leap frog products and you can't go wrong.
It takes 2 AA batteries which require a screw-driver to open/close the compartment.
Though it takes longer to open and close its of course a safety feature and great to have.I'm not sure how durable this will be- or last in the months to come.
It has a flimsy concern to the legs but we shall see and will update accordingly.
Also I wish it had 8 legs.. and 8 balls and colors.. to be true to an octopus.
Leap Frog should of taken it a step further to do so."
"If played with the sound on, the toy will tell you when you find or don't find a ball under the shoes.
But it's just too slow for my two or four year old.
By the time it's told them that the ball isn't under a shoe, they've looked under two more shoes and fought over the ball they found!
My one year old girl is more the speed it works at, but she's one and doesn't understand what the toy is telling her.
I'm not sure who they were going for with how slow it works.The toy works just great with the sound off.
I like it better without the noise!
:)For for the one year old, I really do feel that it's a good cognitive toy if I sit down and play this with her.
I think that handling the balls and looking under the shoes helps coordination.
The colored shoes and me or the toy saying colors should help with color recognition.
It is a cool toy for us to play together.For the two and four year olds, it is a one trick pony.
There's not much you can do with the toy other than putting the balls in the top and finding them in the shoes.
But for short bursts or if I need five minutes without a kid, I'll stick this in front of them and it keeps them busy.
I'm not sure they're learning much, but there's definately hand-eye coordination involved.So while it's not ""wow, you've got to get one of these"", it is a fun toy.
I think there's more educational value than their playschool ball popper.
But it's very much like that in that they play with it for a bit and then are done with it for a few days."
"Some toys are played with once than ignored, this is not one of them.
Our two year old's fondness for  playing ""peek a boo"" appears to have carried over to the ""peek a shoe "" aspect of this toy.On the downside it's not very portable as the balls fall out during transport.That said I still recommend it rather highly for it's fun value.
That it's also  educational is a bonus"
The octopus is really meant for only till 2 year olds.I have a 3 year old daughter who plays with it, but finds it quite simple.The quality of construction is very very good quality plastic.There are different sound modes for numbers and colors.
Needs parent to be with to help kid enjoy the colors and numbers and learn.You drop balls from the top and they come out resting into a shoe at the bottom.
The toy tries to indicate if you picked the wrong shoe.My main point is that it is not for 9 to 36 months, but more for 9 to 24 months.
I think a kid older than 2 years may not enjoy it for long time.
My son loves this octopus!
I like that it plays music and talks and after the baby drops the ball in the slot, the baby has to find it under the shoes, so it's a way more fun way to play peek a boo.
It's also great that it guides the baby to find the ball with verbal cues, so it works on independent play and thinking skills.
You can use it educationally for cause and effect as well as learning colors and numbers, two modes that you can set the octopus to depending on what you want to work on with baby.
Fantastic toy and I'd highly recommend it!
"My daugher understood that she needed to put the balls in the top.
The problem was that she wanted to put everything in the top!
Not a good idea.
I had to fish the wrong objects out of the top.
She could lift the ""shoes"", but she never really seemed all that interested in the concept of putting it in the top and finding the ball under the right shoe.
One shoe came off already after a couple of weeks and I'm not even sure how.
She has balls from other toys and it doesn't work right unless the right balls go in, which is hard because there are so many ball toys.
Toys with small parts are just hard in our house and she only has one toybox!
It seems to me that you can't go wrong with a Fisher Price or a V-Tech toys, but my daughter doesn't care a whole lot for Leap Frog toys."
This may be the first educational toy I've seen that is a 7 legged octopus.
Something a little off about that.
Thankfully the age group it's targeted to will never realize it.
This plastic toy isn't as sturdy as I'd like but is still fun for your little one.
Pop a ball in and guess to see where it'll come out.
Simple concept.
Good for teaching matching colors and numbers.
Nice that it has an on/off switch for the music too, sometimes mom and dad need a break from the loud toys!
Lets face it, LeapFrog knows how to teach educational lessons and have plenty of fun while doing so and this toy is no exception!
Lots of bright colors, a blinking light, and plenty of sound will keep your baby entertained for hours.
Our 18 month old LOVES this peek-a-shoe octopus and will sit for a good while playing with it.
His favorite thing to do is put the balls in one of the holes in the top.
He hasn't quite figured out that the ball is under one of the shoes yet but he will get it.
His older brothers usually get the balls out of the shoes and he puts them back in the top.
The shoes tend to come off fairly often but they are super easy to put back on, it's just frustrating to have to keep attaching them.
I would recommend this to a friend.
We've enjoyed it.
It does what it says it does and is durable.
I give it a thumbs up for sure!
I have a 16 month old nephew and he LOVED this toy, I think it's great at it talks colors and numbers as he doesn't talk much yet.
He loves putting the balls in and finding them under the shoes.
While it isn't that sturdy for a rough 1 yr old, they should be supervised while playing with it as I think it is a little flimsy.
The music on it is fun and upbeat and he liked to wiggle back and forth to it, but like the title, it is fun and educational!
This bright and colorful Octopus has colorful shoes and toy balls to drop down from his arms.
The toy could be a bit better quality plastic, this is light.
You would never guess this is LeapFrog if you saw it.
Usually toys of this brand are nice and heavy.
My kids do play with it and enjoy it.
You can teach numbers and colors with this, but keep in mind this is a pretty expensive toy and honestly I would not pay the asking price as it stands to date.
I would give this 3.5 stars if the ratings allowed, yet since I could not find the heart to give it a 3, I chose a 4 for the bright colors and the fact that my kids all like it.
