Reviews:
"My 7 year-old daughter loves dolls, and was so excited to get Adora, a beautiful, high-quality doll, with a carefully painted face and a well-made body.
At 20"", Adora is large and toddler-chubby, and her weighted body both looks and feels very real.
Her hair, which is cut straight with bangs and parted in the middle, is not quite as exceptional as the rest of the doll - it's definitely a step down from American Girl hair - but it's not bad.
Overall, she's a very, very nice doll.Adora comes dressed in a cute black and pink-leopard tutu dress with matching headband, tights, leg-warmers, and shoes.
The outfit is good quality and cute, which is fortunate, because our Adora is stuck in it.
None of our other hundreds of pieces of doll clothes will fit her, and when we went looking for additional Adora clothing, we found that most 20"" outfits cost $30 or more.
So, although this is a beautiful doll, especially perfect for display, I suggest you keep in mind that if you have the kind of child who loves to change her doll's clothes, you should be prepared to spend to outfit her."
This is a well made doll and the first good alternative to American Girl I've encountered.
Our toddler (4.5) got an American Girl and our 18 month old wanted something similar.
Adora was a GREAT alternative at a lower price point.
It's beautiful and well made, but still reasonably delicate.
"'Regular' baby dolls haven't been a thing with my daughter over the last 7 years.
When she was 2, she was really into Living Dead Dolls.
As she hit 4 years old, she became a huge fan of Monster High dolls, and still is today.
I think she's had one or two Cabbage Patch dolls and a couple of Disney Princess babies too, but I can't say that I've seen her play with them very much.
When we both saw pictures of the Adora Ready to Rock baby, we said the same thing out loud:""Her face is creepy!
""Still, I went on and ordered the doll just to see how a seemingly normal baby doll at this price point is.
In stock images, nothing about the appearance seemed to justify the high price tag, and I figured maybe it was just a name brand thing.
When she arrived in the HUGE delivery box, I was surprised at just how big she was.
Yes, it says the size right there in the item name, but it was still a shocker.
Out of the box, it was clear that her outfit had a lot of time put into it, even for a mass produced doll.
The fabric and stitching is top notch.
Ditto for the hair as well.
This is high quality hair that will survive years of play and brushing for sure.I still stand by what I said about the doll's face.
I don't feel like it's realistic by any means with that cold stare and lack of expression.
Clearly I'm in the minority when it comes to this category.
If you think the doll looks pretty in stock images, you'll adore her when you see the real thing.
Given the number of double takes I made when I would walk into a room where she was, I can definitely say that the doll is reasonably lifelike.
When asked, my daughter mentioned the baby powder scent as being one of the doll's strong points, which was interesting to me, as I found the smell to be a bit cloying.
Helen also enjoyed playing with the doll's hair, but I got the distinct impression that the she wasn't really all that happy with the quality of the hair.
She has an American Girl doll and has grown accustomed to a pretty high level of quality.Helen liked playing with the doll a lot, but when asked what she wanted for her upcoming birthday, she did not hesitate in stating her preference for another American Girl doll.
Is this an unfair comparison?
Perhaps; you are paying a lot more for one of the American Girl dolls, but it is worth noting that the Adora dolls aren't exactly being sold at bargain basement prices.
It's a price range where I would expect less ambivalence from my daughter when I ask her how good the hair is.
It's likely that she would have been just as happy with a doll that cost half as much.
I'm new to the 'professional' doll world and it's artists...so I wanted to see what a $90 doll was like for myself as a vine product.
I'm not going to lie....at first I was skeptical.
I would never that price for a doll, or so I thought.These dolls are gorgeous.
Everything about them is well made and adorable.
The facial expressions, the hair, the outfit, the packaging, you name it.
The doll really looks like a child!
Her eyes are stunning and her coloring is perfect.
The outfits are cute with a lot of thought and quality put into them.
Once I got her, I started to search the web to see how comparable she was.
I've learned that the Adora dolls are amazing.
They have a variety of styles and sizes of dolls, as well as different outfits and accessories.
I can see why people collect these.
Also...most of the dolls in this price range are still Barbie doll size or twelve inches....so at 20 inches, you really are getting a more life sized doll from Adora.Lastly, while I see these as collector dolls...I do feel that a child that handles dolls gently, could love a doll and take care of a doll like this for years.
I anticipate that this doll will last a very long time.My second doll is already on its way.
:)
My wife has been collecting dolls most of her life, and certainly since the day we were married.
Several of her (our) marriage gifts were dolls of various sizes and types.
She began with a collection of Barbies and still has most of them.
They are in completely &#34;played with&#34; condition.
Naked, shoes missing, a leg missing here, a head missing there, ink on some, etc, they are in a box in the closet, but she will not part with them as a precious memory of childhood.At some point, long before we met, she was given what I term, Collectible Dolls, for birthdays and Christmas.
Mostly these are porcelain faced dolls.
Never played with, they remain in their original boxes displayed on a etagere.
Next were Cabbage Patch dolls, and I'm not sure but I think she has everyone ever made along with the accessories.We went to Chicago shortly after being married, and happened to go in the American Girl store.
So, there has been a fortune invested in those over the years.
So expensive!
Those she does get out occasionally, and reads out loud to them from their books.
It's cute to watch.
It's like my beautiful wife is a young child when she does this.
Maybe that is why she became an elementary school teacher...the children are like her dolls.I had never heard of the Adora dolls before this came up on Vine, and I jumped at the chance to get it.
Money isn't so plentiful right now, and an $80 doll would be out of the question!It arrived yesterday, January 7, 2013, after delays in UPS shipping due the winter storm.
She was thunderstruck when I handed it to her.
This Adora doll, Ready to Rock, is absolutely stunning.
She is perfect in every detail, from her silky hair to her beautifully tailored clothes, this doll is a real winner.
This doll has become my daughter's new favorite, she's simply in love with how beautiful she is.
Her eyes are so very realistic and Ella takes her everywhere we go, insisting to even buckle her up in the car.
Perhaps it is how delicate this Adora doll is made, she looks like a porcelain doll yet without being so very fragile, she's still a doll a little girl can play with and enjoy and baby without worrying about dropping her and breaking her.
She has thin, blonde hair that doesn't become a mess every time Ella does anything with it, like so many other dolls.
Her shoes and socks even manage to stay on, Ella hasn't lost a one yet!
Her outfit is too cute!
And those eyes, always looking, so pretty, not creepy at all (like I find many porcelain dolls to be, LOL).
My daughter simply adores Adora, and thinks I got her a doll to look like her when she was younger, that's how much their features match.
Simply Beautiful!
I was a little skeptical about these hyper-realistic baby dolls, but this one is very cute.
My daughters have enjoyed swaddling and snuggling her--it has been a while since we had a little baby around here and I think it made everyone nostalgic.
This doll is definitely weighted enough to almost feel like a real newborn.
The dress is adorable and the details overall are well-done.
A quality piece of work.
This Adora doll is ready to rock in her adorable trendy cloths.
She comes in a pink leopard print and black velour knit dress.
She has blonde hair, a great expression and realistic blue eyes and eyelashes.
She's complete with her velour leg warmers over her pink tights and tennis shoes.
From head to toe, Adora measures 20 inches.
Her body has weight and see feels so real its almost scary.
She comes with a diaper and also a baby powder scent.
She has hand painted detail and made of high quality vinyl.She is so realistic, I can't emphasize that enough.
If you closed your eyes and I told you I was passing you a baby, upon holding her you would really think she was real from her weigh and feel.Age recommendation is 6+My daughter had a doll and me PJ party at her school this past week and she took Adora with her.
I can't begin to say how many people loved the doll, and other kids wanted to hold it and said how real it felt.
My daughter loves it and it is her favorite doll currently.
I got this thinking it would be a for my oldest granddaughter to play with when she came over.However it is kind of weird looking.
While in may ways very &#34;realistic&#34; it is (at least to me) rather disturbing.But on the other hand it is perfect for helping to set up lighting.
I use this doll when setting up studio lighting for photo shoots.
The &#34;skin&#34; of the doll has a realistic sheen to it that helps in figuring out how to set up lighting with minimal shadows and less glare.
I've been looking at different dolls for a long time for my daughter like American Girl dolls ect.
So when I got offered the Adora Ready to Rock baby doll I figured why not.
When the doll arrived my 7 year old daughter instantly fell in love with her and named her Molly.The doll is very easy to remove from the box so that is a huge plus, especially when you have a little girl who is eager to meet her.
This Adora doll has very nice clothing and they are very cute, however I was surprised to see that the bottoms of her shoes are foam.
Considering the price of the doll I would expect them to at least be pvc or cloth or something.
The dolls wig is also very thin in the back of the head so that you can see the lines on her head.
We also had to cut the head band off (its connected to her head by a string) because it wouldn't stay in place.
It also doesn't really move into any other position then sitting which is ok but it would be nice if her legs moved.The doll is the perfect size for preemie clothing and even shoes which can be found at thrift stores for very cheap prices.
Despite the issues I see with this particular doll my daughter is infatuated which is all that matters to me.
She says over and over how the doll is so cute and so nice.
Hopefully this doll will last  through my daughters childhood does and maybe long after that.
We got this in time for our five year old daughter to receive it for Christmas.
She is picky about dolls and although she initially likes all dolls, some end up not being played with for some reason or another.
This doll is getting a high amount of play time with our daughter.First off, the face is beautiful...
The box says hand painted and I believe it.
The hair looks like real human hair, I don't think that it is, but it looks very realistic.It was very easy to unbox and did not have dozens of twisty ties, and in fact there were two plastic &#34;holders&#34; that positioned the doll into a mostly sitting position.
The doll tilted slightly, but overall it was a good design that was easy to open.
The legs and arms move and bend and the action seemed well made and not like it was going to break or fall apart.I really can't find much bad about the doll.
The leg warmers were a little cheap for a doll this expensive, with threads hanging off and such, but for serious doll admirers, this is a top quality doll and is well made and beautiful.
Adora Ready to Rock Doll is a very very cute doll.
My 6yr old daughter can't stop playing with her and loves taking her everywhere we go.
Like all the Adora &#34;20 dolls The &#34;Ready to Rock&#34; Doll is hand painted for extra detail which really comes out in her cheeks and eyes.She is weighted to feel like a real baby girl and weighs about just under 5lbs.
The hair quality and hand painted detail on this doll is so good that when my daughter and i took her into a local restaurant and she sat her in a high chair we had waiters and passerby's doing double takes and one even said they thought it was a real baby girl  : )  .You can also buy different outfits and accessories for the Adora doll which add to the fun and creativity.
If your child loves dolls or if you know someone who loves dolls I would highly recommend an Adora doll they are beautiful and high quality.
Our little girl has a few dolls but none of them compare to this one.
As a dad, I (of course) don't pay too much attention to doll details (though I do think some look beastly!).
However, as I was taking this one out of the box, I knew right away this was a great doll.
It is solid, realistic, well-made, and of superior quality.
My boys (who like to torment dolls!)
could even tell this doll was for real; they don't mess with this one because it is so nice.
Our little girl loves this thing - she holds it like a real baby and doesn't drag it around by the leg like she does her other dolls.I could go on, but since writing about dolls isn't my forte, I'll end with this: if you want to invest in a very good doll for your girl, get this one (or any Adora doll like it).
You won't be disappointed!
My daughter loves her Disney dolls, but has shown a real interest in more realistic dolls when she goes to friends houses.
Therefore, I really wanted to get her a realistic doll.
The appeal of Adora is that they make a very strong line of dolls, which means you can go through all of them with your child and pick out The One that is perfect for her.When the doll arrived, my daughter was so excited.
We got her out of the packaging and she sat her down to have tea with her.
She kept playing with the hair a lot, and was a little sad that she had a fixed hairband so that she couldn't do as much with her silky blonde hair as she would have liked.I was surprised at the high quality of the doll and the realism.
She's quite weighty and has real diapers.
Of course she has a face and hair that is more like a toddler along with legs that are more like a newborn (bent inwards) and wears a diaper, so that part is less realistic but 'cute'.My only disappointment was that it takes some effort to get her to sit up, my daughter is always sitting her here or there to eat breakfast, watch a movie, etc.
It takes her a little bit of effort, but not bad.The expression is cute and innocent.
I did have a comment from another family member that she was a little creepy, but that of course is a perspective based on how many horror movies you have seen!
The craftsmanship on this doll is amazing.
The face is so incredibly lifelike (so much so that my daughter didn't want it in her room at night because she thought it was real).The body is very firm-almost like a bean bag.
Not so much flexibility in the arms and legs but very lifelike in heft.Overall it's an amazing doll and I highly recommend it.Only downside is the powder scent is way too strong in my opinion.
This is our first Adora doll.
We have owned American Girl, Karito Kids, Corolle, Goetz, and many others.
My daughter is 8 years old now but this doll looks very much like a toddler version of her at that age.The doll is very lifelike, with deep nostril and mouth openings, highly detailed and articulated hands with a slight sheen on the finger nails, believable tear ducts, deliciously fat rolls on the legs, and warm coloring.
The eyes are glass instead of painted, and have depth to them.
The eyelashes are exaggerated in an adorable way.
The head has a slight jiggle to it when moved that gives it the kind of natural head bob a real baby would have when bounced or rocked.The legs are hinged or strung in a way that allows her to sit in the traditional bowlegged, spread position that baby dolls do, but the legs can also be positioned straight under her, the way they would sit if you were holding the baby with the legs loose below her.
The arms also swivel, but are not as articulate.The doll's bottom is large and weighted so that she sits upright naturally and with ease, and it very much adds to the feeling the doll is real when you hold her.
Her body is soft and huggable, with the fabric portion extending about halfway to her knees and halfway to her elbows.She has a sweet smell to her that is faint and not at all overwhelming or oppressive.Her head rotates from side to side.
where her plastic neck meets her cloth body.
The hair is wonderfully done in the way it hangs and moves, and also adds a great deal to the feeling the doll is a real baby.
We have been able to keep ahead of snarls by brushing her hair once a week and I have not noticed any damage to the new look of the hair so far.
I will update this when we have owned the doll longer.I am not a huge fan of the outfit, but my 8 year old daughter loves it.
She particularly loves the sparkly shoes and the realistic diaper that the dolls wears.
The clothes are very high quality and compare in quality to the period clothing that American Girl makes.
I would say it is better in quality than the modern style or Bitty Baby clothes they sell for dolls.
Also, I like that this outfit looks like something a real toddler would wear.If your child likes to change diapers, you should pick up a pack of preemie diapers.
