Reviews:
We have a 3 year old son who always gets left out of family game night since he's really not able to play most games with us.
This game says it's for 5+, but he was able to understand (with teaching through cause and effect) pretty quickly how to play.
We laughed each time the boat tipped and spilled the penguins (who are really cute, by the way).The kids had fun figuring out where to place their next pirate penguin to try to make us tip it with ours.
The only issue we had was that a few times it tipped because we bumped it.
That just made us play more carefully.They've asked for it at least every other night since it came and we took it out.
I'm pleased with this because it keeps their attention, teaches them and is really just fun for them.This is a great product.
I noticed that another reviewer mentioned that the penguins are all the same.
This didn't really bother me because a few paint markers will customize them quite easily.
My son loves pirates, so I thought this would be a fun game for our family.
The ship looks neat and the penguin pirates are cute, but the game is impossible for my family to play.
The ship is so extremely tippy that we struggled to get more than 2 pirates on the ship at one time.
The point of the game is to learn the strategy of balance, but I think Jenga does that better.
My kids gave up after about 10 attempts, so I tried and quickly realized that this game is poorly designed.
There is so little balance in the ship to begin.
I'd definitely pass on this game.
"The thing I like most about 'Don't Rock The Boat' is its simplicity.
The older children get involved in the logistics of it as well as in making things happen if it gets too calm.
The younger ones just enjoy marching the cute little penguins around.
There is plenty of room for creativity.
A Zip-lock bag is going to come in handy.
The game comes with 3 masts, a 2-piece water wave, and 16 ""Pirate Penguins"" all the same size and shape, a very nice size and shape to play with.
I plan to give ours individual identities by putting initials or designs on their fronts in different colors.
This is the kind of game that we seem to spend hours playing with together.
I suspect the penguins will outlive the masts.
Over time they may end up in a doll house occasionally.
That's okay too.
They're adorable."
I have to say this is about the most straight-forward game you can find.
The rules, starting from youngest, each person puts a penguin on until they fall off.
The one placing the penguin that causes the boat to tip loses.
That's it.
It has all the simplicity that makes a great college drinking game; simple rules and some physical dexterity.We played this game a few times and it did hold my kids' attention for a while.
It was nice that it was accessible and enjoyable for a 6 year old, an 11 year old, and a 44 year old.
It is good for any age group.
The game pieces are simple to assemble and seem to be durably built, all you need to supply is gravity.Pros+ Very simple Game Play+ Good for a range of ages+ Well and Ruggedly constructedCons- one of our penguins was mis-cast so he leans and is hard to placeSummaryThis game is so simple and basic there is little to say about it.
It is a decent fun game that anyone can pick up instantly.
Some small education value as it teaches balancing skills, but mostly just a mindless physical challenge of a small bit of thought, dexterity and daring.
My kindergartner adored this game.
When it came out of the box, she happily played it for over an hour.The pirate ship balances on an ocean blue triangle platform, and the object of the game is to get your penguin pirates on to the ship without tipping it over.
This game requires your child to think about weight, balance, and early geometry skills.
It requires an engineering thought process to figure out how to put the penguins in place without ending the game.It can be played with multiple players, or played solo.My only request for future versions of this game is to make the penguin pirates unique.
In this edition, they are all black and white, with no individual personalities.
It would add a dimension of imaginative play to have the pirates be characters themselves.The details of the pirate ship were spot on.
The deck was textured to look and feel like planks.
The sides of the boat were glossy and attractive with brassy trim.Very satisfied with this game.
It's a keeper, and a great toy to give as a gift for birthday parties!
"Don't Rock the Boat is along the same lines as Pick Up Stix, Don't Break the Ice, and Jenga.
The object of the game is to place as many penguins on the ship as possible without the ship toppling over.
My son spent hours trying to balance the penguins and then laughing when they all fell down.
I found it interesting how the shape of the penguin and their hats gave my son more ideas on how to hook them on so they would not fall.
When he got tired of using the game as directed, he took the boat off the ""wave"" that makes it rock and played with the pirates and pirate ship separately.
Besides the missing pirates (don't pieces always get lost when kids are having fun with a game?)
this game has stood the test of time.
My son is really rough with toys and he's played with this game everyday for a month.
The game gets extra points for keeping his attention so long!"
This is a nice looking toy.I got it for my 4 yr old Grandson for Xmas.He got bored with it, as it is Frustrating!You have to keep the ship balanced as you each take a turn putting little penguins on the top of the ship.There are three little look out towers.
One in the middle, and at both ends of the ship.
If you start out with the penguinsin the middle tower , then put a penguin in another tower it all tips over, and you have to realize that is not the way to go!It seems all the penguins have to be put on the deck in just the right place, or it does turn over.Forget about using the look out towersThe ship sits on a very small tip of the holder,which does fall over easy.We found this game very frustrating for a 4 yr old and for ourself!
!The 4 yr old is having fun just playing around with the ship, and the penguins, but not as the game is suppose to be used for.
This pirate boat is a balance game.
The basic premise is that you balance little penguin pirates on the ship to try keep it from tipping over and dumping all the pirates.
The plastic ship sits carefully balanced on the base, so that it tips quite easily.
Kids learn how to place their penguins carefully and deliberately, so it teaches both hand-eye coordination and also helps them grasp the basic concepts of balance and counter-balance.
But there isn't quite enough to the game.
The whole game is putting penguins on the boat until it tips.
When it tips, game over.
That can take as little as one turn, then, all done.
One penguin too far from the center of the ship (more than a couple of inches) can tip it over quite easily.
I think coming up with a way to have it tip a little less easily would have improved the game.
Obviously, you play many times, taking turns, but you'll need to adapt it, say by coming up with some type of scoring system, in order to keep older kids engaged.
My kids have also really enjoyed just playing with the pieces, so that has been an added bonus.
So this game does have some potential as a family-time game for play with young children.
It is based on a simple concept, and that is a good thing for young game players.
And the ship and penguins are fun.
So it does pretty well at what it does, but don't expect too much.
Sometimes the simplest toys and games are the most fun.
By placing weighted penguins on a pirate ship that's sitting on a pole, your child slowly learns the science of balance.
As my son said, it's similar to Jenga, but it's a lot more fun for younger kids.
The penguins are made from sturdy rubber, and the ship and the wave it sits precariously on is made from plastic.
Overall good quality, challenging, and fun.
Perfect rainy day game.
I was excited about playing this game with my kids, but it turned out to be a disappointment.
Like other reviewers stated, it is just too difficult to balance more than a few penguins on the boat before it tips over.
The most we put on was five, and they have to be clustered around the mast.
Placing the penguins anywhere else on the boat results in immediate capsizing.The first day we played it a couple of times, but then they lost interest.
We tried getting it out again a few days ago, but my son did not even want to balance the boat on the wave.
He just wanted to place it flat on the ground and put the penguins on it.
Needless to say, that is not very fun either.
On the positive side, the penguins are cute and probably will join the Little People in pretend play, but the rest is probably destined to be recycled.
"Patch Products' ""Don't Rock The Boat"" is simple yet fun.
It's an excellent game for youngsters under the age of eight, but I don't know if kids older than that would enjoy it very much.The concept behind the game is simple.
All you do is balance the pirate ship on the ""wave"" and each player takes a turn putting one of their ""pirate penguins"" on the ship.
They can place the penguins anywhere they want, from stem to stern, and even pile them on the masts and in the crow's nest.
The first player that ""rocks the boat"" and knocks at least one penguin out of the ship is the loser.When you open the box you get a wave with a small rod that inserts into it.
There's also a pirate ship with three easy to attach masts and a pack of sixteen pirate penguins.
Simply place the ship on the rod that inserts into the top of the wave and you're ready to go.My five year old son laughed the entire time we played.
He adapted to the game rather quickly, and begin to think out each move for a longer amount of time as he began to understand the balancing act of the game.Overall, this is a brilliant game.
All of the penguins looks and is weighted alike, so there's no advantage of having one certain penguin over another.This is a very fun game for very young children, and they can learn a lot from it as well!
Highly recommended."
The versatility of this game struck me immediately.
I like that the toy can be played with independent of the game.
Just put the boat on the floor and play with the pirate penguins.
As far as the fame goes, it's an easy concept that teaches kids about balance in a fun way.
And who doesn't love pirates?I couldn't give it five stars because the boat/iceburg are really cheap and flimsy.
My son popped the floor of the boat out trying to put on one of the masts.
The masts also don't fit very well.
It doesn't take much for them to fall down.All in all, it's a great gift idea for all ages.
I had originally written a review for this toy when I received it a few months ago, but it seems to have disappeared, and I was hoping to update it now that we've had it for a while.
My five year old grandson still loves this game, and we play often.
I was afraid it would lose it's cute appeal but actually he is getting very good at it, and is figuring out how to balance the boat, a good skill.
It does have small pieces, so not for the very young, but any child over three would probably have a lot of fun with this.
Ahoy, fellow mateys, we have a task of balancing a motley crew of cutish, pirate penguins, of all things, on a rickety, precariously tilted ship.
Can you believe it?
?Yes, you will, once you play this game.
Obviously, our kids, 8&6, love the penguins.
They make up their own games, when we're not playing the official one, and have pretend adventures with the black and white bird crew.The set-up and game playng are simple.
Take turns trying to balance penguins and ship.
Practice improves play, and we try to keep it lighthearted and not frustrating.
Actually, the kids seem to prefer it when they do spill everything.
Lots of laughs, not a whole lot of education here, maybe some fine motor skills.Also, we recommend handicapping the better or more mature players, e.g., use only your non-dominant hand, face away and stretch your arms from behind your back while looking over your shoulder, stand on one leg(Walking the Plank Method) and balance a book on you head while placing the penguins, and for severe test of skills or punishment- wear a blindfold.
The options are practically endless, but let the little ones have a fair shot, i.e., let them win!Fun, simple game, goes well with Pizza, Popcorn, and watching or reading, Mr. Popper's Penguins.
My three year old can't really play this, but the five and six year old love it.
And also the 46 year old.
I'm not much of a game guy, to be honest, so it's a treat to find games both I and the kids enjoy.I was worried it wouldn't balance well, be too tippy; but it's fine, not finicky at all.
The boat deck does pop off if you're a little rough, but it snaps back on easily.
After playing with it for a couple hours it doesn't show any signs of falling apart, so I'm feeling good about the durability.The online video shows penguins sitting out on the yardarms, but I can't figure out how to do that without putting two penguins down at once so we changed the rules of the game to permit this.It's a lot of fun trying to get all the penguins onto the ship without spilling, and it's a lot of fun when they spill.
We usually play four or five rounds, maybe ten minutes, before tempers rise too high to continue.
Sometimes the kids play on their own.
I thought the game might be a little too hard for our little kids, and in fact, they complained at first about it being too hard.
Their penguins kept falling off the ship.The concept for the game is simple enough like a number of similar object-balance games out there, but that doesn't mean that it's easy to play.After a few rounds, the kids got the hang of it, although it was still pretty tough to keep those penguins on there.We devised a few different ways to play (adding to your pile any that fell off, etc.
).It was a fun game.
It wasn't the easiest to get it back in the box for storage.
Just take a look at how everything is packed and then try to put it back in that way.
"A cute game and a nice remake of the old don't tip the boat game.
My 4 year old is obsessed with pirates and all things pirate.
To say he loved this game is an understatement.
The object of the game is to get your penguins on the boat which is balanced on a ""wave"", without causing the pirate ship to tip over.
It teaches the kids about balance as they learn how to place the penguins in different positions to keep the boat balanced.
It isn't a game you are going to play for hours on end, but it nice for a short session, and it does get played several times a week."
"This is a quick, fun game.
It is easy to play, but not so easy to win as you learn how to balance the boat.
But even my youngest child keeps wanting to play again because the thought tends to be, ""I can do better next time.""
And since the next time comes so quickly, it maintains the fun, whilst giving hope of doing better even when you lose.The parts all seems sturdy enough to last awhile and it is a game we get out when we want a short, easy to play, fun game.
And the penguins are cute too."
