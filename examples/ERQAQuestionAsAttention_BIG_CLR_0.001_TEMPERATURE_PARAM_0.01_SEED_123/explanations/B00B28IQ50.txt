Reviews:
I've loved the game Sorry since I was a kid, and now I get to enjoy it with my children!
What I like about the game is that it's easy enough for young players, yet fun for all ages.
Even my grandma gets into it.This &#34;Classic Edition&#34; has a vintage look and feel to it, but it's the same great Sorry.
Perfect family game!
"This is the classic Sorry!
game that we all grew up with.
I was excited to find a version that looked exactly as I remembered from when I was growing up.
Both of my sons enjoyed playing this game all together as a family.
It took a quick read over the directions to remember the game and then it was on!!
!When it came in, my son asked me what the game was and I described it as a sort of combination of Trouble and Chutes and Ladders.
It was a little frustrating at first to get them playing correctly and of course there were times when each of them landed on the ""slide"" and missed their ""safe zone"", having to go around the board again.
But that's all part of the game!I'm not sure if they were really ""sorry"" at times.
But we had a blast and they're asking for it again!"
I am so glad we have this board game.
It is a lot of fun.
My family played this several times and it is my 11 year old's favorite game.
The box looks all retro.
It just looks fun.
The rules are based on the 1939 US version of the game.
You can play normally, a faster game where you use 3 men of a color instead of 4, partners, or even play by yourself!
I've never considered playing a board game by myself but instruction are included to do so.The box contains 44 cards, gameboard, and 16 pawns.
If you like board games, I recommend you add this one to your collection.
I love this nostalgic design; the color scheme is beautifully done in the classic Sorry color scheme.
While I cannot say with 100% certainly that everything is an exact replica of the originally released version - it seems authentic to the time period.
Although my family is very familiar with the rules the illustrated instructions were a delight.While there are many versions of the Sorry game my family likes the original game board version the best.
This classic version will make a great addition to game night.
We've been having a blast playing the classic Sorry with my five year old.
Part of the fun is that he has to make us do something we don't want to do.
Hence, SORRY!As adults, my wife and I appreciate the retro-cool board and playing pieces.
It reminds me of my youth playing 30+ years ago.
The box and board are sturdy enough.
The cards are also somewhat heavy stock and should last for a long time.Overall, we're having a lot of fun!
When it comes to board games, very few titles get the designation of being required.
Monopoly.
Scrabble.
Sorry.
These are all board games that families need in their library.
When my husband and I were both kids, we both enjoyed playing Sorry!
with our families.
We hadn't added the game to our collection till recently as our children are now old enough to learn how to play with us.
We wanted to be able to partake in playing together for memory and the sake of fun of a common game that they'll probably even continue playing with their own kids in the future too.This remake in the classic style has a durable board and the cards aren't cheaply made at all.
The rules written just like the original back when the game came out in the 1930's.
We found the instructions to play mostly clear, but since it uses wording from the 1930s,  it might take a couple reads to understand some of it.Sorry!
has a four different ways to play (Classic, Partnership Sorry, Point Scoring Sorry, & Patience Sorry) so you could mix it up every time!
I had only ever played the classic version but really enjoyed Point Scoring Sorry in which you start with a piece on the board.
Additionally you have a hand of five cards, increasing the chance to do something on your turn.
If not, you merely play one without effect and draw a new one.
This gives you a bit more control in the game compared to the classic version if you want something with a bit more challenge.Our daughter who is 5 1/2 years old wants to play again and again.
She literally has asked to every single day since she's played for the first time.
It's a great way for kids to practice counting, make decisions, and learn good sportsmanship.
A fun classic game to pull during any family game time!
I have fond memories of playing &#34;Sorry&#34; as a kid.
The rules are simple, but it still can be fun to play even as an adult, racing to get all your pieces home before the other players manage to do so.
This particular edition is nice for those of us with a bit of a nostalgic bent, as the board and cards look pretty much like they did a few decades ago (I think they're based on an even older edition than what I grew up with).
Just like the classic Sorry game I remember from my childhood!Sorry is a classic game that I remember playing when I was a child and now get to play with my kid.
Although it is kind of teaching your kid to be mean, and excusing them for being selfish with the Sorry go-back rule, it also teaches them that everything in life cannot be so easy to win.
Sometimes, there is someone who will set you back in life and it's up to you to learn how to deal with that.
For younger kids, you can dispense with the Sorry rule and just play forward if you like.
Isn't that the fun part about board games anyway?
Making up your own house rules!This set is good quality.
It has a strong cardboard board, hard game pieces, and standard cards to play with.
The box has the printing and advertising style of the older game... even older than the set that I played with in the 80's.
Instructions are clear and well outlined.
The simplicity of the game and big clear blocks on the board makes it a game you can play with young kids, grandparents, and everyone in between.Very happy we have this game again in our home.
"A TRUE FAMILY OPPORTUNITY.
This game can be played by pre-school child.
What an opening for parents or grandparents to interact with children of their family or with others.
If you like visiting at the senior center, take it along and you'll be the hit of the room.
Everyone can play, and almost everyone knows how.
That's why it's called classic.
It will be classic and still played in the next century too.Anyone who has played knows that now matter how behind a player is, there is always the chance to regain momentum (or the opponents get Sorry-ied) and suddenly find themselves in the lead.Perhaps one of the greatest games available from the old-school (non-tech) realm that is educational, challenging, but above all, just plain FUN.This set is boasted to be retro-classic.
It is in many ways.
For one, the game has changed little since the invention of 1933, copyright Parker Bros. in 1934.
My treasured 1939 copyright game has everything but the game board which came separate from the box with the cards and player pieces.
The outside of the box looks almost identical to this new product, but the old box was only 4x7x1 inches.
My instruction sheet is almost identical but a third the size as the new.
So you see, the rules for ""POINT SORRY!""
are as old as the game itself.
Another difference is the card back, while slightly larger in the 2013 Hasbro, and the old is blue, while the new is red.
Of course the new cards indicate Hasbro.In the early version, the ""men"" or ""playing pieces"" were made of wood with stained colors of yellow, blue, red, and unstained natural.
"Sometimes the original is better than the new versions, and I think this is one of those.
The game itself is a bit dated and today's children can lose interest pretty quickly to their tablets, smart phones, and gaming interests.
As a ""throwback"" classic game, Sorry is a lot of fun and this version is a fairly accurate recreation of the one ""back in my day"" before today's diversions.
I think this comes down to two decisions.
If you want something to bring back memories for you while playing this with your kids, fork out the money for this one.
If you just want a board game for the kids, buy a cheaper and/or newer version."
This Retro Classic Version of the staple Sorry board game is a gem.
Quality is excellent and really elevates the experience of game play.
We have a tradition at family gatherings/dinners that board games are played throughout the day and it was special pulling out this old fashioned version - big hit with everyone.
a++
I loved playing SORRY as a child, and now I can teach my kids the joy of sending their siblings piece back to start.
The classic edition has a more sophisticated look to the cards.
The only complaint that I have is that some of the writing on the cards is a little small.
The directions give you a variety of ways to play the game depending on the age of the people playing.
Overall, this is a good quality game with pieces that should last for the long haul.
I have never played the original version of &#34;Sorry&#34; before.
The &#34;classic&#34; board game is real fun with more than two players and makes a great party game.
Inside the box you will find the rules to the 1939 US version along with a few variants of the game.
The reproduction pieces of the game look real authentic (too bad the pawns weren't made out of wood) along with the &#34;Sorry&#34; cards and dice.
Now all they need to do is bring out some more original versions of other classic boards.
They were so much more cut throat making them all the more enjoyable.
"""Sorry"" was a family favorite when I was a kid, so I'm especially happy to pass that on.
Because so much is one's success is based on the luck of the draw, it can be enjoyed by adults and children of different (reading) ages together.
Math skills are used, and also players (if properly supervised) will learn, in their turn, how to deal with disappointment, or not to gloat, important skills some grownups never learn."
Sorry was the first game we taught our son at around 6 years old and we have been playing it steadily for 10 years or so.
It doesn't loose it appeal.
When we began playing with our son at that age, he was often aggitated in losing or getting 'sorried' by someone.
I think it really taught him sportsmanship at a pretty early age, especially watching the same thing happen to us.Sorry Classic edition is the same game but the recreated the board and the cards in their original form when the game was first introduced.
It is really beautiful and more sturdy than our 10 year old game.This would make an excellent gift for anyone who loves games and especially someone who used to play on this 'classic' board.
"I've been a sucker for board games for close to 55 years, so I was delighted to see that ""Sorry!,"" a Parker Brothers game that was popular when I was growing up, has been resurrected.
Rather than concentrate on the particulars of the game (which are covered by Amazon's product description), I'll try to give prospective buyers a sense of this particular release.As mentioned, ""Sorry!""
was originally manufactured by Parker Brothers, the same folks who gave us ""Monopoly"" and ""Clue"" (both favorites of mine, many old editions of which I own).
Hasbro acquired Parker Brothers and, it would seem, licenses the titles they own for manufacturing by others (in this case and not unsurprisingly, a Chinese facility).
Hasbro's intention was to replicate the earlier release of ""Sorry!""
and, except for substituting plastic pawns for wood, they've done a nice job.
If memory serves, the board graphics are quite authentic, as are those of the playing cards.
Even the instruction booklet looks vintage.
Instructions are provided for classic ""Sorry!,"" as well as variations (the most well-know of which is ""Point Sorry!.""
I'm perhaps a bigot but it really annoys me that children are now raised to favor video games because there's something so ""bonding"" about playing a game or assembling a puzzle with family or friends--it just seems to me that the tactile element of handling pieces and holding cards is so satisfying.
I'd so like to see these classics find a new audience and I appreciate Hasbro's effort.Perhaps the most important element of games like ""Sorry!""
is their versatility: children as young as six (or maybe a bit younger if they're very bright) can learn to play and eventually hold their own against parents and older siblings.
And finally, these games are fun and can be taken to a higher level as a player's skills increase.
They're really never boring.All in all, I'm very pleased with this current incarnation of ""Sorry!""
and am nicking a star on the basis of my being really tired of articles' being produced in China; the fact that the label on the box's underside is rather sloppily applied is undoubtedly due to carelessness at the factory level.
""Sorry!""
I got this for my husband and I to play with our 5 year old son.
He absolutely loves it.
I love that the directions are on each card, so we always know how to play without having to refresh our memories by reading the directions.
I'm not sure if this is a new feature or not, but I don't remember it from the Sorry!
game I played back in the 80's/90's.Overall, I absolutely recommend this.
It says 6 and up, but a 5 year old can easily pick this up, especially with the directions on each card.
My boy loves playing it and asks us every weekend if we can break it out.
Very happy with this game!
"We aren't a big game playing family.
When I was little, that was what Grandparents were for.
Now, my mother plays with my kids.
We are quick to buy new games for Grandma to enjoy with the kids when they have sleepovers.
Its a win-win.When Sorry Classic Edition was up for grabs, I jumped on it.
The classic cardboard game board, the plastic hershey kiss-like game pieces and black and white old type-faced cards.
Its kind of cool!I don't think my kids were as impressed with the look as I was, but it was still a fun-filled family game night where all 4 of us (kids aged 6 and 10) had a great time.
Not often do we unplug and do something ""analog"", but this was a special night of no screens just to see if we could do it.With the help of the Classic Sorry game, it was a success.
Not without some pouting and frustration from a 'always needs to win' 6 year old, but fun nonetheless."
This is a game I received one Christmas among a stack of board games that also included Life and Careers, when I was at an awkward in-between age somewhere past Santa but not quite yet old enough to drive a car.The relative gifting me with the games went old-school, side-stepping the usual video games.
I don&#8217;t know what happened to my original game, but although this one is a much earlier version (1939) of the edition I received that Christmas, it is every bit as much fun to play.This is a fast paced, easy game for those aged six and up.
In its entirety, this particular edition is quite handsome including the replica of the original instructions, game cards, board and box.
It is a great addition to any collection of board games, and would make a distinctive gift for others with a fondness for classic games.
I have always felt that the game of Sorry is extremely underrated in the world of board games.
This old school board brings me back to my childhood as it is exactly like the board I played on in the early 90's.
If you're a fan of the game Sorry and you like a retro feel to your board games that gets away from the flashy trends that even the most classic of board games have begun to fall under, pick up this board game for your next party and turn back the clock to the good old days.
My daughter is the Sorry queen.
We can't figure out why, but she almost always seems to win.
In any case, it's a really fun game for the entire family, because you will constantly find that you are neck-and-neck to the finish.
Someone is about to win and then, Sorry!
Sent back to home, giving the underdog a chance to pull ahead (at least, for the moment!).
Ages 6 to 86 (and beyond!)
should not get bored by this game.This is the one to get if you don't want all the goofy versions with far-out graphics.
This is the Sorry I grew up with, and this is the Sorry our daughter enjoys.
The only disappointment (for me, not her) is that I actually remember playing this at a neighbor's house with wooden pawns; these are plastic.
So this is more classic 1980s than, say, vintage 1960s.No noisy electronics, no batteries, plus an edge-of-your-seat finish nearly every time---what's not to love?
I love how Winning Moves Games is coming out with all of these 'classic' editions of long-time family favorite games such as Clue, Sorry, and Yahtzee.
They were great games when they first came out years ago, and now I'm excited to introduce them to my 5-year old and make them part of our family.This edition of Sorry has a fun retro look to it - from the box and the instructions down to the game-board and the cards.
Game rules and play are of course the same as always, and it's still just as fun as I remembered.
My 5-year old is learning how to play and enjoys working on her counting skills and learning how to manipulate her game-pieces to her advantage to win the game - this has become one of her favorite games.Easy fun for the whole family - this would make a great gift for somebody who has never played or even for somebody who remembers playing as a kid.
Honestly i had never played the Sorry board game before reviewing this version.
Reading the rules from the included instruction manual wasnt very helpful so i looked online.
Once i got that done, we got down to playing it on family game night.
My overall impression it thats it relatively fun game but it certainly starts off pretty slow.
Though granted, it does get more fun as you go and have more pieces on the board.
Apperently this is based on the classic version but i wasnt much of a fan of the paper cards.
I would prefer they be plastic so they last longer.
Otherwise though, the board and the game pieces themselves feel nice and durable.
I loved playing sorry in my elementary school days so I was ecstatic when a classic version came out that I could play with my kids, ages 8 and 5.
I forgot however that the cards have the small print on them and this is the evil twist that my kids love to now laugh over.
You must really read the small print because many of the cards have choices.
For example.
The 10 gives you a choice on moving 10 forward or 1 backward, the 4 is only 4 backward.
The 11 says you can more one man 11 spaces OR change places with any one margin man of any opponent, ect..
The game can be a bit longer because of consistently sending people back to the start but it is hilarious and a wonderful way to spend quality time with family.
Highly recommended family board game!
!
I remember playing Sorry when I was a kid and later with my children when they were kids.
Now, I introduced it to my grandchildren and enjoyed some great family time.
Fast and easy to learn, great challenge, fun and sets the mood for family bonding.
Nothing better than a classic, make some popcorn and sit around the table for some laughs, competition and a hi ho time playing Sorry.
As a child of the 1970s, I played hours of classic board games with family and friends - Monopoly, Risk, Battleship, and, yes, Sorry.
The game couldn't be simpler - get your four pegs around the board before your opponents do, and you can occasionally knock 'em back to Square One with a lucky roll (backgammon style).
The addition of the slides, one for each color, adds a nice element of luck/risk to the game.I have a weakness for games that have a lot of entertainment value but can be explained to a newbie inside of five minutes.
Sorry fits the bill.
This version is suitably old-school - cardboard, paper, and wood, all colored in suitably obnoxious loud primary colors.As a father with kids ranging from 3-10 years of age, I wouldn't let this game get into the hands of my three-year old, but my ten-year old is already a Sorry fanatic.All in all, a terrific game for family fun night.
Check it out.
My six-year-old is a board game fanatic and we have weekly family game nights in our house to accommodate him.
When we got this classic Sorry, he couldn't wait to play, and it ended up being, as the box promises, fun for the whole family.Though I hadn't played Sorry since I was a kid myself, the game quickly came back to me, and the set was, as promised, just like those I, and my decade-plus older hubby, remember for our own childhoods.A great addition, neither of us could remember why we didn't already have Sorry in our game closet.
I'm glad we do now, because it's a great addition.
My first introduction to the board game of Sorry was in the early 60's.
Sorry was one of the more fast and fun games.
The object of the game is to be the first player to move all 4 of your men around the board to get back home.
You choose from 4 different colors of your men and your home- blue, green, yellow or red.
There is a deck of cards that tell you how many spaces to move your man, and of course it isn't as easy as just moving your man as quickly as you can around the board to get home before anyone and win the game.
There are obstacles along the way, should a player get to slide, he slides everyone in his way back to start, and no two men can occupy the same space, so someone has to go back to start- Sorry!I remember when we played with 2 players, the game took about 15-20 minutes, but with 4 players, it took close to half an hour.
It's very fast moving and even faster when hardly any players are sent back to start.
I really love the look of this classic 1939 Sorry Game- it's a little different from the one we played on in the 60's.
Regardless of the look you like, Sorry is a fast and fun game that brings back so many fun memories of when we had 15 minutes to kill before we went bike riding to a picnic on a lovely summer day in 1962.
This early version of the game is really a nice one to own and it also comes with other  game versions you can play including a Sorry For One, in case you have a few minutes to kill by yourself!
Some Classic games never wear out their fast fun and this 5 Star Classic Sorry Board Game is one of them!
Sorry was a board game my parents nor my friends had when I was a kid.
So, I jumped on the chance to own this game when Vine was offering it.
The classic design on the box is great, but the nostalgia is taken away by the fact a QR code is on the front of the box!
Did the designers have to do that?
I wish they could have at least put it on the back of the box...it takes away from the overall joy of it being classic.
We played the game regular style and points style.
I liked the points style better because you have five cards and it makes for better strategy and gives you options.
It's a fun game and also good if you have two people to play, as opposed to four.
I haven't played Sorry!
for years and years, but this edition looks exactly like how I remember it.
For those not familiar with the game, it is very similar to Parcheesi in that you have to get a special number to get out, you bump other players and you have to try and get all your pieces around the board and &#34;home&#34;.
It's a fun game as long as none of the players are going to be sad about getting bumped.
