Reviews:
This is a very fun game to play with a little one.
The rules are simple enough, the gameboard is bright and colorful, and the gimmick is very entertaining.
Move around the board, and use the various implements to loot Hook's hammock as he sleeps.
Knock him over, and you lose.It can, however, be pretty tricky for a very little one (3) to manipulate those plastic pieces without knocking over Hook.
Others have complained that his hammock is too easily disturbed, but that really depends how you connect the rubber bands.
Use a couple extra if your child is very young.Really, it's fun to play and hear the little one giggle at the silliness of it all.
Good stuff.
This is a fun family game.
Our 4, 5, & 7 year old played it for an hour tonight.
It took about 5 minutes to put the game together and another 5 to learn the directions.
The pieces are well made for little hands and game play is simple enough and (this is key) fast enough that our kids do not get bored with confusing instructions or having to wait to long before it is their turn again.
The point of the game is to move around the board and remove items from the hammock without knocking off Captain Hook.
Fans of the tv show will love the game.
The biggest fans will be 3 1/2 - 8 year olds.
Unlike a couple of other board games I have seen based on recent and current Disney series', this Jake and the Neverland Pirates game is a 100% winner.
It features an intuitive, normal gameboard that plainly guides players in its age range and lets them know which game piece they need to use to remove treasure from a hammock containing Captain Hook.If you accidentally knock out Hook or tip over the Hammock, it's a bust.
Case closed.
I think many children younger than the target age can enjoy this game (particularly when playing with an older sibling).
Its fun and basically fool-proof and perfect for Jake and the Neverland Pirates fans.
A parent must set this up as it involved building the hammock around two trees.
It's an easy set-up but what we find is that the board must be on level ground and not move.
Try playing this game with three adults and a five-year-old who can't sit still.
While other reviewers commented that it is hard for young kids' hands to remove items from Hook's hammock, the five-year-old had no such problem.
His problem was moving the board and making the pieces fall down.It's a fun game with family and young kids.
The little ones will squeal with delight playing this, but it can get tiring!
"My boys love Jake and the Neverland Pirates and it is show that we have nothing for - no books or toys.
Now that they are getting more into board games I love that Wonder Forge has created a game featuring their favorite pirates gang and its honestly a game I don't mind either!Setting up the game is easy - just snap in the two tree and the hammock with the included rubber bands.
Then place Hook and his 12 treasures on the hammock.
Then 2-4 players take turns moving around the board game with the goal of removing the most treasure pieces and not knocking off Hook.
There is no Start or Finish, just whoever knocks Hook off.
Each player spins to see how many moves they make and then depending on what you land on is what you do.
Land on a Treasure chest, remove that type of treasure, Land on a colored ""X"" removed a treasure of that color, and it you land on a Tool you have to remove a treasure using a specific tool.
Yes the tools are pretty cool and make the game challenging.
There is a shovel, sword, tweezers, and fishing hook.
Oh and if you spin the Broken Bride, any player on a bridge piece loses a treasure piece to Tick Tock Croc who is sitting patiently under Hook's hammock.
The game is over when Hook falls or all treasure pieces removed.This is a board game unlike others we have played and its fun for the whole family.
We are practicing decision making especially with this game as my boys have learned not to just grab any piece!"
The Jake and the Neverland Pirates Who Shook Hook game states it is aimed at preschoolers and for ages 4+.
That age range is generally the ones that will be big Jake and the Neverland Pirate fans but my boys who are ages 6 and 8 had a blast with it.
That age isn't that far off from what I think.
I think it's more suited for 5 - 8 years olds.This game will need help from an adult in setting up.
The board is cute with Hook sleeping in the middle on a hammock that is strung between two palm trees by rubberbands.
That is where my boys needed Mom's help and supervision because rubberbands can become weapons with two boys.The game reminds me of an Operation type game where you must grab the items using a sword, fishing pole, tweezers or shovel from the hammock without toppling it over which is where Hook is sleeping.My boys really liked it.
My five year old nephew is a big fan of Disney's Jake and the Neverland Pirates.
He grabbed this game in a jiffy when I showed it to him.Likes:*My nephew and his pals learned the game quickly after I set it up and taught them how to play.
*The goal of the game is to follow the path on the game board and try to plunder as many of Capt.
Hook's treasures as possible using the tools provided (sword, fishing pole, shovel, or leaf tweezers).
The space that the player lands on will designate what color treasure, which type of treasure, or which tool to use, etc.
*Teaches children hand/eye coordination, manual dexterity, colors, types of items/loot, and problem solving using the best tool to pluck and recover the treasures that Capt.
Hook took from Jake and his pirate crew.
The trick is to remove the correct item from Hook's hammock without dropping the item or disrupting the balance of the hammock and Hook falls off/wakes up!Concerns:*Smaller items are choking hazards to kids younger than four years.
*My nephew and his pals sometimes like to make up their own rules to make the game to their advantage such as using the leaf tweezers all the time.
Parent/guardian supervision might be necessary to ensure fairness and following the rules.Overall:A fun, educational, and challenging game that captured the attention of our little pirates for almost an hour at a time.
Jake and The Never Land Pirates Who Shook Hook Adventure Board game is a very simple game that can provide a lot of excitement, but at the same time some amount of frustration.
Captain Hook is sleeping away in his hammock with all the treasures he's collected.
The trick is to get them out without waking him up and tumbling him into the waters below where the Tick Tock Croc will gobble him up.
Ahoy, Matey ... that would never do!WHAT'S IN THE BOX:&#9658;  2 Palm Trees (2 Trunks and 2 Palm Fronds),&#9658;  Sand Base,&#9658;  1 Spinner,&#9658;  1 Hammock,&#9658;  3 Barrels,&#9658;  3 Treasure Chests,&#9658;  3 Tikis, 3 Money Bags,&#9658;  4 Tools (Leaf Tweezers, Sword, Anchor  Fishing Pole, Shovel),&#9658;  1 Captain Hook Figure&#9658;  1 Game Rules Manual.This game, which can be played by 2 - 4 players from the ages of 4+, has simple rules with dire consequences if the Captain tumbles into the water.
The game is over when this happen.
When it's a player's turn, he or she spins the spinner.
The space that is landed on determines which kind of treasure to get or which tool will be used to try to snag it.A little patience and dexterity are the key because if a player can't snag that treasure the game could be over if the Captain and the treasures fall out all at once.
When all the treasures have been removed from the Captain Hook's Hammock successfully, the game is over.
The winner, of course, is the player with the most treasures in hand.The game is fun, challenging, but if you have a youngster who has a low level of frustration, you may wish to take a pass.
The strategy is similar to the old game Operation ... strategy combined with a good amount of dexterity ensures for some fun, exciting game play.JAKE AND THE NEVER LAND PIRATES:Fisher-Price Disney's Jake and The Never Land Pirates - Jake's Musical Pirate Ship BuckyDisney Store Disney Jr. Jake and the Never Land/Neverland Pirates 7 Piece Action Figure Figurine Gift Play SetLeapFrog Explorer Learning Game: Jake and The Never Land PiratesFisher-Price Disney's Jake and The Never Land Pirates Hook's Jolly Roger Pirate ShipJake and the Never Land Pirates Matching GameFisher-Price Disney's Jake and The Never Land Pirates - Jake's Talking SpyglassRoomMates RMK1793GM Disney Jake and the Neverland Pirates Peel and Stick Giant Wall DecalUncle Milton Wall Friends Jake and The Never Land Pirates Room DecorDisney's Jake and the Never Land Pirates Never Land Sailwagon
This game is a lot of fun.
It is kind of like a combination of the classics Don't Spill the Beans, Don't Break the Ice, and Operation.
I really like the creativity behind the game and how there are different tools for different pieces of treasure on the hammock.
The tricky part is keeping the hammock balanced when removing the treasures.
It flips very easily if the wrong one is removed.
I also like how the board game adds a different twist of how to remove the treasures.
You can remove it by color, by tools, or by type.
A lot of fun for the Jake fan who is into games.
A great starter game for young ones.
This is a really fun game.
We purchased it for our girls (ages 3 and 5) from Toys R Us during the Black Friday time period.
They are big fans of Jake and the Never Land Pirates.Setup:  You hook the trees into the board, hang the hammock between the trees using some included elastic bands (or you can use hair ties, or whatever to adjust the tension), then balance the sleeping Captain Hook in the middle and surround him with various objects.
I hold the hammock until everything is set up and balanced to make sure it doesn't fall.
Then you put your characters on the board.
The game is quick to set up once you have done it a few times and got the hang of it.Play:  Your characters start anywhere on the board that you want.
You spin the included spinner and move your piece and do what the spot you land on says to do.
It varies from use a specific tool (4 tools included) to pick up any piece, pick up a specific piece with any tool, pick up a specific color with any tool, or give up a piece to Tick Tock Croc (basically lose a piece and a turn).
You keep picking up pieces until all the pieces are removed, or someone grabs the wrong piece and Hook falls out of the hammock.
The four included tools to grab pieces are very clever.
They include leaf shaped tweezers, a fishing hook, a shovel and a sword.
Each tool and piece needs a different strategy to use successfully which teaches kids to problem solve.
My 3 year old was doing really well taking pieces off of the hammock with the various included tools which really helps with concentration and fine motor skills.
You do have to be careful to make sure the little kids don't knock the board while they are moving their playing piece because it can knock Hook over.Durability:  The only concerns that I have are durability.
The board already seems to be splitting on the seams where it folds.
Not sure if one of my kids bent the board wrong, or it is just weak.
This is a fun board game.
It has a simple spinner, fun molded characters, and a great setup.
There is a hammock strung between two palm trees that make up the board.
You add a bunch of different items to the hammock as well as captain hook himself.
Based on where you are on the board you have to use a specific tool to remove an item or any time and remove a specific color item.
All of this while not dropping any other items and of course not disturbing captain hook.
Our three year old really loves this game, and gets excited at using the different tools and going after the different items.
Board is easy to setup, and quite unique in it's play while still being fun for the young and older kids.
My kids love Jake so they really wanted to play this game.
It's easy to set up but does require parents to make sure all the pieces are balanced prior to starting.
It was a little frustrating for my four year old at first because you have to be careful and have a steady hand.
With time, she's gotten better at it but games still end pretty quickly.
My two year old always wants to try it but that usally means game over as soon as it's his turn.
I think they'll grow into it and I like the challenge for them as it will work on fine motor skills, manual dexterity and develop their mental abilities.
Who Shook Hook is fairly difficult to set up before playing.
Hook needs to be in the center of the hammock and the hammock needs to balance to avoid dumping him.
It is a hard flat piece held in place between two trees with small rubber bands.
Then, every time you put a piece of treasure on the `hammock,' it starts to tilt.
I played with it a little to try to be able to put pieces on or off without dumping Hook and that part of the game could be properly called, Who Almost Shook Hook.Then the differences in ages also caused some difficulty.
Any time the 4 year old tried to remove something, she dumped the whole thing.
Her brothers, who at 6 & 8 are more coordinated than she, finally decided that when she had to pick up a piece, she could just use her hands instead of the shovel, leaves, sword, or fishing pole.And the game was more complicated than necessary.
If you land on a treasure space, then you have to remove that type of treasure using any tool.
If you land on a colored X, you need to remove one treasure of the same color.
If you land on a tool space, you have to use that tool to remove the piece.
If your spin is the broken bridge, any player on a bridge loses a piece to the Tick Tock crocodile.
I think the bridge was the final straw.More problems were caused when the most proficient reader was the one who had to constantly check the directions and if he got annoyed with the directions, he just decided they could pick any piece, any way they wanted.There is definitely a learning curve involved in playing this game.
I'm not sure what the age 4 + is about.
They can't set up their own game and it would require constant resets as every time they take some thing off, the whole thing will most likely fall.
I would call that not-grandma-friendly.
"""Who Shook Hook"" is easy to set up, easy to learn, and great fun for elementary-school kids and ambitious preschoolers.
The parent or oldest kid sets up the game so that Captain Hook and 12 treasures are balanced on a (rigid, flat) hammock, then kids take turns carefully taking treasures off.
The game is over when Captain Hook falls off, or when all the treasures are successfully removed.Since games don't take long to play, you can use this game out satisfactorily fill available time periods as short as half an hour including setup and takedown, during which you should be able to get about three games in.The spinner and board tokens make things interesting by requiring you to get a certain color of treasure, or to use a certain tool (some are harder to pick up pieces with than others).
They also periodically provide opportunities for players to catch up; if someone happens to land on a bridge space, they don't get to take a treasure that turn; and if someone else spins ""broken bridge"" (one out of six chance), everyone on a bridge space gives up a treasure.The players will quickly learn to take pieces off alternating sides of the hammock, to keep it in balance; so there is your physics lesson.
And it takes great care and dexterity to get some of the treasures, depending on which tool you're using and how the treasures are deposited on the hammock; so it reminds me of the classic game Operation--Hasbro Operation Silly Skill Game with Sound FX--except this game is actually more fun.My two little boys wanted to play this game over and over.
I suspect this board game will become a part of the entertainment repertoire since it's fun, easy, and fast."
"I use this in therapy for preschoolers.
The kids that watch Jake love it!
It was very easy to set up, even for little hands.
They loved the characters and Captain Hook.
At first, I was a bit dismayed about the hammock falling so much but read (on these reviews) where you should use all FOUR of the bands to hold it.
That did the trick!
For the 3 and 1/2 year olds, they didn't even want to move around the board.
They just wanted to spin and pick things up.
I also did this the opposite; they had to pick up objects from the sand (floor)and put them ON the hammock.
For smaller children this can be a better lesson in balance and shorten frustration if the hammock keeps falling.
We also played ""treasure"" hunt around the room with the objects.
Great game and many ways to use it!"
I thought this would be a great game for the kids.
But for me I could not even get the hammock to stay up.
Everytime we started to play, everything would fall off.
We never put more then four items in the hammock before the game is over.
If your child hits the table or get excited the game would tumble to the floor.
The object of the game is to collect the most treasure and not let Captain Hook fall into the crocodile infested water.
If Captain Hook falls into the water the game is over.
You then count up your treasures and see who won, but the person who knocked Captain Hook into the water automatically looses.
It's a simple game that uses a spinner to move player pieces around the board, stopping on spaces that either make you loose a turn, lets you pick a treasure by color, or have to use a tool to pick a treasure.My 4 1/2 year old enjoys this game, but I wouldn't say he's crazy about it.
He likes to pick the treasures off the hammock and wait to see if Captain Hook will fall in.
Well, ever since Who Shook Hook came into our house, it's been played with every night.
This is extremely high quality, fun and challenging.First of all, setup was an absolute breeze.
A couple of hooks.
A couple of clicks.
Done.The basics are simple:  You have a Hook Figurine sleeping on a hammock.
All around him on the hammock are treasures.
You place your figure on the game board and spin the spinner.
Depending on what it lands on you have to remove a treasure from Hook's hammock without shaking him off.
There are four different tools to choose from when removing treasures - some more difficult than others.
If you drop the treasure, it belongs to the tick tock crock.
Once you get all the treasures or Hook falls off the hammock, the game is over.We've had a lot of giggles playing this one.
It takes a steady hand and teaches strategy.
You can make the game more difficult by using different types of rubber bands to hold the hammock up - making it more unsteady.
We also like to make it very difficult by putting hook on top of all the treasures and trying to get them out from under him without knocking him over.This one is just about as much fun for me as it is for the five year old.
When she asks if we can play, she gets an enthusiastic Yes!
from me.
What a cute game this is, and an instant hit with my kids 5 & 7.
The instructions are simple, just pluck hooks stolen treasures off his hammock.
Watch out though,  one wrong move and you knock hook off into the water.Its an easy game to set up so the kids don't really need any help with it.
That's one of my favorite things because it seems like games these days take longer to set up than to play.
With complicated directions and less then par pieces.
Not so with this game, all the pieces have a quality feel to them.
So I'm sure this game will last quite a long time.Since its Jake and the Neverland pirates I can see it being an instant hit with a lot of youngsters.
Along with making a great addition for family game night.Its a very affordable game in comparison with others or there.
This would be a great gift for any pirate loving scalawag in your life.
Arrrgggggg.
Really enjoy playing this game with my daughter, who is a huge Jake fan.
Game is well made and easy to play.
Only issue is that it takes a bit of a steady hand to set up the hammock to start the game.
Can be a bit frustrating for a younger child to master the art of balancing everything in the hammock to begin the game.
But we enjoy it and it can be a quick and easy play that holds their attention and builds coordination.
Who Shook Hook game is a lot of fun once everyone gets the hang of it.
It takes a while to setup and this definitely needs to be done by an adult or a much older child than 4 or 5.
I found that hanging onto the hammock while loading it with treasure works best.
The object is to move around the board and do what the space tells you to do.
You either remove a piece of treasure with a tool you choose, a treasure piece that is the same color as the space, or using the tool the space tells you to use.
Spinning a Broken Bridge causes anyone with their game piece on the bridge to lose one piece of treasure to Tick Tock Croc.The rules are fairly simple and my 5 yr old granddaughter grasped them easily.
However, the dexterity required to remove the game pieces is almost too much for her.
She persisted, however, and learned to use the tools pretty well.
However, she often bumps the game board which causes the treasure and Hook to fall.
She was really frustrated at first, but we just hold the board steady when she is taking her turn and this helps a lot.The instructions say the game is good for preschool and ages 3 and up.
I don't believe there is anyway that a 3 year old could play this game, and a 4 year old would be kind of iffy.
My granddaughter played the game with her 7 year old cousin and he was much better at it than she was.
He loved the game and played it several times.Pros:  Simple rules.
Moves fast so child doesn't get bored waiting for their turn or for the game to end.
Also, no batteries!Cons:  Not really suitable for those under age 5.
"This is our new current ""favorite"" game.
With 2 boys, ages 3 and 6 who both love the Jake and the Neverland cartoons and toys, this has turned into a very fun game.
Some adult supervision is needed at first.The game is easy to set up and put away.
The pieces are fun, and the only one we've had some trouble with so far was the fishing rod, which my 3 year old likes to pull apart.I also realized that we were hanging the hammock incorrectly (after MANY games in which Hook never falls): The game comes with 4 bands to hang the hammock, but you only want to use one on each end, leaving 2 as spares.
Now when we play, you have to be more careful as players can now wake Hook.LOVING this game!I recommend it for ages 3-6 as a 3 year old should have the dexterity to play the game, and much above the age of 6 and kids will start to get bored."
