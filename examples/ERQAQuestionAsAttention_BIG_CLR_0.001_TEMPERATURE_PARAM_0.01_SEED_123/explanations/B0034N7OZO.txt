What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
"As other reviewers have pointed out, this kit does not come with any instructions.
That would have been an automatic deal-breaker, if those same helpful reviewers hadn't pointed out how you can obtain and print out the directions online.
(Amazon had a GREAT price on this, otherwise the fact that the manufacturer was too cheap to include instructions would have made this a ""Do not purchase!""
item right off the bat.
)My ten-year-old Daughter loves Science, and was thrilled to receive this set.
I will warn you that this is not a good idea for ""Hands off"" Parents...be prepared to get in the trenches with your kids and potentially get messy.
A lot of the experiments were below her level of Scientific knowledge, but we didn't mind.
We had fun playing with the set together, and that's worth the price of admission.
There aren't really 70 different experiments, by the way...far from it.
Some of what the manufacturer considers as ""experiments"" include filling a test tube with water and using it as a vase, or burying it and using it as a time capsule.
Basically, if you don't have high hopes of using this kit to educate your child, and if the price is right, it's not a bad way to have some fun with your kids."
"My nearly seven-year-old daughter and I are only up to activity No.
22 in this kit and we have had a lot of fun with oozing, gooey, slimy and otherwise intriguing polymers.
We've played with garbled marbles, learned about the magic of diapers with Water Gel, and made Insta-Snow powder (and frozen it), Gravity Goo, Jiggly Jewels, Worm Goo and more.
We've also mixed and mashed all of the above into even slimier (not to mention messier) concoctions.
I'm not sure my daughter has actually learned a whole lot about polymers, at least in terms of the names, chemical compounds or uses thereof, but she's had a lot of messy fun that may come back to her someday in a real chemistry class.Since we're just about polymered out, it's fortunate that our next activities focus on energy beads, carbonation, weather, acids and bases, and magnetism.
For a younger child, this kit contains a pretty comprehensive range of hands-on activities to cover age-appropriate science knowledge, especially chemistry.
The age range, however, is probably pretty limited.
The kit recommends the product for ages 8+, but I would lower that a bit to perhaps five or six, as I think the upper limit would be about age 10 before kids will lose interest in many of these activities.There are a few drawbacks to this kit.
For one thing, it requires an awful lot of things from home that you are expected to have on hand, or else you'll need to run out and buy them:  one and two liter bottles, red cabbage, straw, potting soil, Mentos candy, and Total cereal, as just a few examples.
I would recommend checking the required ingredients upfront or at least several activities ahead because there's nothing like an eager scientist losing motivation by needed trip to the store.My other quibble is that there really aren't 70 different activities in this kit.
Many of the activities are just another step in a sequence started by the previous activity.
For instance, Activity #1 involved making ""Fizzing Colors"" by dissolving the colored tablets in water in the capped test tubes.
Activity #2 involves crossing two test tubes one behind the other and looking through them both to see how the color changes.
Activity #3 involves mixing the colored water in a mixing tray to watch the color change.
Some of the activities are just, well, lame.
For instance, one activity involves using the test tube to send a ""message in a bottle"" by screwing the cap on to make the test tube waterproof.
"The kids love this kit.
In fact, it's very well done and all the experiments work very well - even if many of them are similar.
A lot of the experiments are of the ""just add water"" or ""mix these"" type, so it's not intimidating for the kid to be leading the way, and the adult to be there to watch in amazement (or horror, as the kid makes a big glop of goo - on purpose!
)However...the ""how it works"" sections are a little repetitive (as if each were done in isolation, not knowing that two experiments up had almost the identical explanation.)
Also, some of the experiments ask for stuff that you never actually need.
One experiment wanted food coloring, a bowl, and a mixing tray.
The food coloring and mixing tray were never used.And the worst of it:  One of the experiments build on each other (which is kind of awesome by itself), but at times, when they build on each other, they expected you to do things a certain way (like color things a certain color without ever specifying that.)
In addition, sometimes you get clear instructions like ""dump ALL the goo powder into the test tube,"" which is great.
Other times, you get fluffy, non-science words like ""some"" like  ""Put some crystals in the petri dish.""
What?
Some could 5...or 5 short of all of them.
Some kind of guidance would be nicer.
This can be alleviated by reading ahead to see what you're going to need (and how they assumed you mixed things like color), but it's something that was overlooked when writing up all the experiments.Overall, both the adults and kids are enjoying this set - the biggest fan is probably a seven year old that's having a tremendous amount of fun (and hopefully even a little learning, to boot!
)Would recommend, even with its shortcomings."
Once we figured out the instructions we really enjoyed the Big Bag of Science.
The experiments are simple without being lame.
My 9 year old can do them himself.
You do have to read ahead and make sure to add some things to your shopping list.
But they aren't expensive or difficult to find.This set is pretty messy.
I have the kids use it in the unfinished basement.
I think it would stain.
But really it is a great kit.
There is lots of discovery value and a sense of accomplishment.
For the price I think it is a steal of a deal.
"I love science.
I'm an engineer and a father, and science fills our lives.
I am always looking for great science projects to do with my kids and things they can do on their own.
The problem is that chemistry and science kits today are dumbed down from the kits when I was a kid - they tend to be mostly toys, lacking some of the cooler experiments I remember.
Want to know why kids want to be lawyers rather than scientists and engineers?
I blame the dumbing down of science through programs like STEM, but I digress - this is a review of a product, and I want to make sure you know if it is something to buy your kid.
I will review it for what it is - a kids toy science kit.So you hand this to your kids and tell them to have fun with it.
First problem, the activities are really for a 5-7 year old, but the instructions are written for a kid who is at least 9 or older.
MyThe Magic School Bus - Chemistry Labcame with colorful cards each with an experiment.
This ""Big Bag"" comes with a black and white instruction book filled with dense text and instructions.
You can't just hand this to your kids and off they go - you need to read it with them.
Not much of a toy if the kid can't even play with it themselves.The first ""experiment"" is to put 3 different color alka-seltzer tablets into one of three different test tubes.
Yes - you've colored water.
If your kid has made lemonade, they've done this one.
The second is to hold the test tubes up to light to ""mix"" the light color (ever held up two balloons to the light?
I thought so).
"Unlike the old-fashioned chemistry set, this set makes science entertaining and fun, while teaching the scientific method for performing experiments.
The book is fun to read, and will even engage the adult ""supervisor"".
(There is no need to restate the various tools, vessels and substances provided for experimentation--the Amazon write-up is thorough--except to observe that the carry-case makes it much easier to put things away between experiments.
)Although this set is said to be ages 8 and up, it would be prudent for a parent or other adult to be present unless the child is a good deal older.
The experiments can be messy and need to be done as suggested.
It therefore may not be a good gift for another child if the parent's approval hasn't been obtained."
We love adding hands on activities in our homeschool for science.
This kit includes 70 experiments covering chemistry, biology, geology, and much more.
Most of the activities can be done by the child with little or no help from the parent.
This would make a great gift for kids for all ages!
