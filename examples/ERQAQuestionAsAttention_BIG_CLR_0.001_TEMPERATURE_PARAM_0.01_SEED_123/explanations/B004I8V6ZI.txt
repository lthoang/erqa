Then again, isn't that the case for most toys?As for the product itself, it seems durable and well manufactured.
This pair of trucks was tested by a four-year-old boy, who loved them instantly.
I received this set of ratchet cars along with the full race track kit that can be purcahsed separately.
They go pretty fast and very straight, but they have run into our daughter and she was fine.They also last a pretty long drive time for the amount of twisting effort.
They go a pretty long distance.

Reviews:
"My four year old played with this for about five minutes, and was not at all interested in it.
It says for ages 3 and up, but I think there's a very narrow age window that this would be fun.CONS:-the photos make them look bigger than they are....each are about 4"" long.-they twist to activate the ""motor"" that makes them run (rather than the pullback and release style of other toys)--I'm not sure a little kid could figure that out.-the button to activate the car is the same as the reset button to deactivate it.-cannot be used outdoors-the connecting device has a small notch in it, hard for little hands to line up-VERY noisyPROS:-they drive for a decent amount of time and change direction if they hit something, kind of cool-no batteries or charging required-chunky shapes pull apart and can be mixed with other car pieces (two max per car)-seem very sturdy and strongIn all, these just weren't very fun.
A classic matchbox car lends itself to more play..."
Our daughter is 14 months old.
Too young for the suggested age range, but she still really enjoys these.
She is also a good benchmark for durability as she drops these, knocks them into the floor, and generally abuses them.
Not only did they stand up to the abuse but they stayed together (2 halfs to each).But to overall impressions.
These would be easy for a 3 year old, even 2 year old to start using themselves.
You just have to teach them to put the button on top to the up position.
Then they twist the front for the ratcheing to take place.
Then put the car down, press the button and let it go.
They go pretty fast and very straight, but they have run into our daughter and she was fine.They also last a pretty long drive time for the amount of twisting effort.
I was pleasantly.
But good kid powered cars, that had our daughter laughing and going after.
Would be a hit with boys or girls.
"The manufacturer says that this toy is for ages 3 and above.
Depending on a particular child's collection of toys and experience, this might not be exciting enough for an older child.
The words, ""Choking Hazard - small parts.
Not for children under 3 years..."" is an attempt to alert adults about potential dangers, rather than an developmental or interest level.
When I see a toy like this (two pieces of truck with enclosed wheels) I have to conclude that testing has shown that, under some circumstances, a particular child may ""play"" in such a way as to make the toy come apart, dropping small parts.I think the best age for this pack of two vehicles would be 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 years, though older children (up to perhaps 6 years) could be interested in side-by-side ""racing"" (they don't really travel very fast even on wood floors), especially if several cars were involved.
At the early part of the age range, an adult would need to ""wind-up"" the toy by twisting the front half of the vehicle against the back half, and the child could press the button to make it go.
Learning to twist clockwise sequentially would be next (with a younger child twisting back-and-forth to no effect), and finally putting the two halves together by lining up the ratchet mechanism.Pros:--The recognizable school bus and fire truck combination appeals to both genders.--Smooth, durable design: the details of both are die-poured in the design, so no ladders or lights come off (which can be a problem with a variety of metal ""pull-back-and-release"" brands)---Fair price for two ""automatically moving"" vehicles---""Twist-ratchet"" mechanism is novel---Comes with clear illustration of how to use---Fairly quiet (a ""pro"" for me): the ratchet sound ends with a click, and the running sound is no louder than another other ""pull-back-and-release""--No batteriesCons:---Button to activate movement (""launch"") is also used to reset for winding--this sequence might take some learning.---I understand that it is a toy, but twisting the front of a vehicle to get it started does not happen in the real world.
Nor do any vehicles switch front and back ends.
Again, my personal opinion.
Maybe this doesn't matter to others.Overall, a nice toy with some nice features - nothing I was blown away by."
I spend far more time putting two halves of the cars together than I think my daughter plays with them.
The idea that they can interchange and swap a firetruck front with a bus back is fun and all, but in order to put them back together, you have to line up a small channel on both ends, something my daughter doesn't have the dexterity to do yet.
So instead of playing with them like trucks, rolling them on the ground, she thinks it is far more fun to take them apart and have me put them back together.
She has lucked out and done it herself a few times, but for the most part it is me.
Not that I mind playing with her, but the point of the trucks is lost.My opinion, these would be far better toys if they DIDN'T come apart to switch.
They are a great size for younger children, but the concept of switching the parts is a bit advanced for the younger child and it takes away from the purpose of rolling a car/truck around.
These cars have you twist the entire car to wind it.
Cute idea and fun.
The big problem that ruined it for me is that the two parts of the car come apart.
In other words it breaks apart.
You can put it back together but it is very easy for one part to get lost and then the other is useless.
Would not recommend.
My two-year-old is absolutely obsessed with vehicles, particularly school buses, so when I saw this toy, it seemed like just the thing for him.
It wasn't until after we got it that I really examined what it could do and I realized what a great concept it is.The vehicles can easily be split into half, and all parts are interchangeable.
This means my son can play with the school bus as is or we can take it apart and reconstruct it as a half school bus/half fire truck.
Naturally, the more of these sets you own, the wider the variety of mixed-up vehicles you can create.When two sides are joined, they can be turned, winding them up.
Once they're fully wound, you can set them down, push the button on top, and off they go.
I really like the button feature because, unlike conventional windup toys, these vehicles don't take off until my son is good and ready for them to do so.Because my son's younger than the recommended age, he does have difficulty getting the two parts together, but he has learned how to wind them up, thanks to his eight-year-old system, who also enjoys playing with them.
It's fun to watch my little guy put them on the floor, press the button, and then laugh his little head off when they take off.
They've been quite a hit with him, and I'd recommend them for the car-crazy little person in your life.
Oh, and their parents will thank you for buying a fun toy that moves but doesn't require batteries.
These cars are different from others since you can interchange the front/back ends of them and to wind them up you twist the two halves rather than pull them back on the ground.
This works pretty well, and you can hear them ratcheting as you twist the two halves.As for how well they work, I did have a learning curve in understanding that part.
The button on top is what makes them go once you've ratcheted them all the way up.
The clicking will get louder once they've reached their max.
The wheels won't move until you press the button, so that's nice for younger kids, or for setting them up to race each other.
What I didn't at first realize is that once the car needs ratcheted again, you must press the button again or else it won't ratchet.
I just thought it would automatically reset itself, but it doesn't.I also thought the cars would be a bit heavier - they're pretty lightweight, which isn't necessarily bad, but they don't seem as durable as they look based on the weight.
They do work well on both hardwood and various kinds of carpet, but they take a while to get up to max speed.
To get them really going, you'll need 10-15 feet of space.Overall, they're not bad, not great, but accomplish their purpose and are still fun to play with.
If you're looking for some cars that are a little bit different than the norm, don't take batteries, and want at least a smidgen of creativity (with being interchangeable) then these would be a good fit.
We don't have many boy toys around this house since we have two girls (4 and 5 years old).
I thought this would be a great product to have for the boys that come over and play.
My 5 year old was the first to try these out.
There aren't any instructions but are easy to take a part, put together, and crank up.
They travel fast on tile, not so much on carpet.
My girls loved swapping out the pieces to make a half yellow half red truck.
Occasionally they would run into something and twist in half and obviously stop moving.
Will this keep kids entertained for hours?
No, but they do have fun with them while they are playing and they don't need my help with it either.
Two thumbs up from mommy.
"If you have more than one little racer in the house you might also want to consider adding  theKid Galaxy Rachet Racers Sports Car/Pickup Truck Setto this set.
Just to give you an idea as to the size, these are approximately four times the size of a Hot Wheels car or an average sized coffee mug.
The four pieces of the vehicles, front and back, are interchangeable for a bit more imaginative play and fun.
They connect easily, but I would not recommend them for any child under the age of three, nor one who might have poor hand and eye coordination.Once the car is connected, you simply twist the front end to the right and keep turning until a ""rachety"" sound is heard (you cannot overwind these vehicles).
When you're ready to go you simply press the square launch button on the top and it takes off.
There are some instances that these don't perform well.
They are not intended to be outdoor toys and will not work on rough surfaces such as grass or sand.
Carpet will hinder their performance as well.
If they are launched into an area where there is a slight incline and hit a wall they won't budge.These are very colorful, exciting little cars, but like everything kid-oriented once the boredom factor hits they will be put aside.
I do like the fact that they can run under their own power and don't need batteries and are interchangeable.
I'd suggest getting a small case to keep them in because they come apart easily and can become misplaced.
The Rachet Racers are fun, innovative, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if they become collectibles."
Essentially, I'm not sure there's a need for these cars.
There are better, faster, cars, that don't pose a choking hazard, and don't require significant fine motor skills to operate.
About the only advantage these cars have vs. others is that you can mix and match the front and back halves.
However, this again increases the fine motor skills and time required for play, as one must constantly be aligning and reattaching the cars (the halves tend to pop apart when they crash).In conclusion, I would look elsewhere for your small cars and trucks.
These little guys are fun, but I am just not sure they can compete with the gadgets and gizmos that are on the market today.
Pros: no need for batteries, compact-good travel toy, could be played anywhere.
Cons: just not sure they carry enough wow factor, no remote &lt;grin>.
Definitely needs to be for a certain type of kid, don't try to impress your remote control, electronic gizmos loving kid with this one.
My children and I really enjoyed playing with the Kid Galaxy Ratchet Racers Fire Truck/ School Bus Set!
We already have the Car/Truck set and were excited to add more Ratchet Racers to the collection.I really like the size of the toys, perfect for little hands to grasp and maneuver.
The ratchet mechanism is simple to use and the push button technology ensures that even those on the lower end of the age bracket won't get the car wound up only to have it spin it's tires in the air.
The fire truck and bus have the added allure of being large boxy vehicles that little boys love (and enjoy making sound effects).The vehicles are durable and have taken hours of abuse from me and my children jumping them off the coffee table, running into each other, and racing continuously.
The ratchet mechanisms have maintained their quality performance and still work just like we pulled them out of the box.Overall I am really big fan of this toy!
However if this is your first Ratchet Racer purchase I highly recommend theKid Galaxy Ratchet Racers Race Car/Pickup Truck Set.
The reason for my high review is that my grandson, just 2 1/2, actually got excited when he began to play with it.
How long will the excitement last, I don't know, but rarely do I see such an instantaneous reaction.....so nice to see....which gave me pleasure, too.
Limited play value.
Poor quality control.The method of powering these wind up cars is creative (you twist the front and back halves) but this doesn't add much to the play value.
You can also swap the front and back from different cars.
Ho hum.
After winding the car you hit the button on top to make it go.
The cars work well even on carpet (not shag).
You have to remember to reset the button the wind them up again.The quality control problem involved a spring-loaded small plastic nub that helps you align the town halves before you trigger the car.
On one of the cars the spring did not work.
This made it difficult to align the two halves.A friction motor car is just as fun, easier to use, and less expensive.
These trucks are really cute.
One is a fire truck and the other is a school bus.
You can take them apart and switch front ends, making a fire bus and a school truck!
lol There is no need for batteries here!
These trucks are run on good old people power.
I can't wait for my grandson to see them!
He loves cars, trucks, etc.
I'm sure these will keep him busy for hours!
Ratchet Racers are fun and at this price point, a good value.They are a chunky fire truck and school bus that you can change the parts on to make a different vehicle.
Unlike another reviewer I thought the trucks seemed very durable.
When we pumped them up we made up a game where we would race them on the wood floor and aim at one of our three dogs.
The dogs loved it and one of them started chasing the bus and eventually pawed it over.
The bus was fine and it was flung a good distance.
I loved that these trucks don't need batteries and can start right out of the box.
They are small and may be hard for a child of three to actually keep pressing the button to ratchet them up, but beside that they are a lot of fun.This would definitely be a great and inexpensive gift for all the birthdays we seem to get invited to.Great for kids 3-6 or older kids who make a game out of it (like my 11 yr old).
This pair of trucks was tested by a four-year-old boy, who loved them instantly.
He liked figuring out how they worked, and went at them with a will.
However, at the end of two hours, the bus' ratchet system had given up the ghost.
He still likes the toy, but keep in mind that it may have an abbreviated life at full throttle.
It really is kid-powered, because the winding system is variable.
My kids are getting a little old for these, but it's still refreshing to see them giggling and racing them down the hallway.
They are easy to turn and go surprisingly far.
(A bonus is that you can't overwind them!!)
They trade the parts back and forth to see if it changes up the who's going to win outcome.They are nicely oversized, and feel sturdy.
Even after many crashes and body part changes they don't look any the worse for wear!
I received this set of ratchet cars along with the full race track kit that can be purcahsed separately.
Overall, these cars are work as advertised, however, the overall quality is quentionable.
We have a total of 4 of these and 2 of them (one from this pack and one from the other set) easily break apart if they are slightly touched.While the race track proved to be useless, my 2 boys did find a use for the cars.
They would setup on on either ends of the kitchen and use release the cars at each other in a type of demolishion derbey.
Whichever car survived the crash was the winner.I would suggest that is you are looking to buy a somewhat different take on wind up cars, stick with buying the cars separately.
Don't bother with the full race track kit as that has serious issues in build quality.We have had these for several weeks now and my kids still play with them so at least the replay value is still there.
The car are easy for the kids to wind.
Instead of pulling the cars along the floor to wind them you twist the back half of the car to wind it.
Because it doesn't take brute strength to wind them this means my kids can do it themselves.
Instead of holding the cars in place and release to launch the cars you just set them down and then the cars stay still until the kid presses a button, the bam!
The thing takes off with an explosion of speed.
It is enough to always get a big reaction when they launch and keeps my kids entertained for a long time.
I got these toys for my 2 year old (which I know is below the recommended age) and she likes them well enough.
They come apart easily which is good for switching them, but annoying when they're going along and hit a bump, threshold or wall and just fall apart.
They go pretty fast on hard surfaces, but barely slug along on carpet.
I was surprised how many times you have to pump them backwards to wind them.
You have to pull them in reverse (to wind them up) 5-6 times for them to actually go fast enough to be worth it.
Overall, they're fine, but not any better than any other car toy-My two year old likes them, but I could see for kids that are older how these could get old pretty quickly since all they do is zoom forward.
This is a great toy for little ones.
My grandson who is 2 yoa loves this he is constantly having me interchange but has finally learned how to do it himself.
He thinks its funny to see half fire truck and half bus going across the room.
This is a fun toy for little ones and to keep them occupied :)
My three year old son got these out of the box and we figured it out within minutes with no instructions.
Basically, to use these cars you twist them like a rachet and it will click when it is wound and with a push of a button it is off!
These cars can be split in half and used with other cars, that seems to be popular with my boy he has to have them mixed rather than just the single color.
These cars are quite sturdy and can bounce off of different surfaces and keep on going.
These are a great toy for younger kids because they are not complicated and very colorful and fun.
The price is right and they are a good size.
I would recommend them for sure.
I chose this for my 4 year old girl about a month ago.
She has an interest in nearly everything.
At first, she had a great time and was excited to use it.
I doubt she even remembers it at this point.
Then again, isn't that the case for most toys?As for the product itself, it seems durable and well manufactured.
The winding mechanism seems durable (usually a problem in toys of this type).
The appeal of this toy, at the current price point, is that it is low-tech.
Last year I must have spent at least $30 in batteries for 2 children.
Pretty sad if you ask me.
This toy is entirely kid powered in contrast.In summation, at the current price point (sub $12), I can recommend the toy for boys.
I suspect they may not lose interest as fast as my daughter.
My grandkids love cars, especially fire trucks and school busses.
This was the perfect set for them.
I like toys that don't require batteries, which these do not need.
Each vehicle has two parts, a front half that has the power port and a rear half that has the power stem.
The fact that they are in 2 parts means you can interchange the halves between any of the vehicles you have.
It also means they come apart easily.
When you put the 2 parts together, you twist the two parts to wind it up.
It is fully wound when you hear a click.
It says there is a safety clutch to prevent overwinding.
There is a button on the top that launches the car when pressed.
They go a pretty long distance.
There is no racetrack as was shown in the video.I thought there were some interesting tips and hints included in the instructions:* Do not allow Ratchet Racers to come in contact with water or sand.
* Ratchet Racers is NOT intended to be used outdoors.
* Do not attempt to retrieve Ratchet Racers if they run underneath furniture.
Ask an adult for helpto help get your cars out safely.In reference to the 3rd tip - if the car goes under furniture, my grandchild is going to be the one to get it out because I am too old to get down on the floor.
They are also closer to the floor!The plastic that the cars are made out of is rigid.
These vehicles are as much fun as kids can have with toy cars and trucks that don't have lots of money draining batteries and easy to break circuit boards.Simple to rev and go and the best part is switching the parts around, building your collection and having a race!Great for the 3 and up set - fantastic on hard surface floors!
When I first saw these vehicles, I thought they looked like they were made from cheap, easily breakable plastic.
However, they have held up well against my 21-month old who certainly doesn't play with them carefully or cautiously.
My son loves these two vehicles.
They were his favorite toys for weeks.
He can't quite ratchet them himself (he's a bit younger than their recommended age), but he can push the button that's located on top of each vehicle that makes them take off - he loves to feel like he's in control of making them go.
There's also something particularly refreshing about them - they need no batteries or electricity (and the fire truck and bus are interchangeable).
When factoring in the price, the entertainment value, and the surprising durability, I think they're great toys.
These cars are nice and simple, which is nice since most toys these days have loud electronic lights and sounds.
These cars have no electronics.
You simply wind up the back of the car by twisting it around, push a button, and off they go.
You can also mix and match by putting one end on the back of another car.
They are very simple but still a load of fun for a toddler or child.
My two year old has enjoyed them immensely and, from an adult perspective, its very nice not to worry about batteries or annoying noises and lights.
There are really no negatives to this toy, so I have given it five stars.
