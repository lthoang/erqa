This product reminds me of the one of my childhood.
There are over 200 pieces here in a wide variety of lengths/types.
The plastic trains are sturdy and the cowboy figures and horses are nice as well.My only complaint is that I wish these had come with a carrying case.
It would have been nice if one was included.
These are pretty much just like I remembered them.

Reviews:
I had Lincoln Logs growing up, and I love that the sets have not changed much since then - this set has the same well-made wooden logs and endless hours of fun constructing towns, towers and bridges.
My children are five and seven, and both frequently pull out this set to play with.
It comes with clear instructions on how to build the depot on the front of the box, but there is so much more you can do with this set.
It was a very nice touch that they included the tracks and engine and the figures.
Overall, it's a very well done set.
We've had no issues with splinters and everything has held up really well.
My only very small issue has been with the box - it fell apart the first week.I'd highly recommend the Redwood Junction set!
My dad played with Lincoln Logs, my husband and I played with Lincoln Logs, so when I saw these I snatched them up for my daughter!My husband and daughter had fun playing with this set, although she is a little too young to understand how to follow the building designs she still had a blast.I am a believer that old fashioned toys are some of the best - such as wooden blocks, tinker toys, and also Lincoln Logs!
Kids learn how to put things together and take them apart, use their imagination, and it gets them away from battery operated toys and electronics!Every single piece was accounted for - no missing pieces!
They assembled everything according to the instructions and it is a very nice set.
The train, people, and animals were nice touches that were not included with the sets we played with as children.You can either follow the instructions or use your imagination to build your own structures - although if you do that the plastic doors and roofs may or may not fit.
So there is some room for creativity, which is so important.I agree with other reviewers that the box is not very sturdy - it barely made it thru shipment in one piece.
So we are going to have to find a plastic storage bin for these Lincoln Logs.
It would have been nice if one was included.
But I feel that is a minor issue and I would highly recommend this set, for those who played with Lincoln Logs as children and want to share them with a new generation of kids!
This product reminds me of the one of my childhood.
The color seems different -lighter perhaps- but the quality and premise the same: a rustic seeming toy, which allows for creativity, but less of a Lego 'infinite universe' type, and more of 'log cabin simplicity'.
Simply put, if you want to build a frontier town, this is the toy to do it.It comes with a lot of pieces -enough logs (and roofs) to make three specific buildings, a train track large enough to circle the town, a three car train to go with it, and three small plastic characters to play with.I feel that this set, unlike some others, is large and varied enough to offer lots of entertainment for children of the right age, but it will likely be played with other toys as well, like action figures, where the log building aspect may be used for forts, or walls, and less for the original intent.
Let's be honest, the original instructions (which are absolutely needed to build the three buildings) will be long lost in a few years, and only imagination will bring this set back to life; you'll never be able to make the buildings again, but you WILL be able to make some sort of buildings, and play with them with other toys.I must also note how well built and easy to use both the train track, and the three car train are.
The track put together very easily, and seemed of nice design and materials, and the trains were nicely crafted, and very easy for small hands to work with.Overall, a nice set.
"Lincoln Logs have been a treasured building toy for nearly 100 years ever since 1916 when they were invented by the son of the world renown architect Frank Lloyd Wright.
They are easy & fun to build with and this set takes it up a notch by including an adorable railroad to surround your log buildings!
There are several generously sized track pieces than can span a few feet depending on how you put them together.
They ""snap"" together very easily (and are just as easy to take apart later), and they hold together well for lots of play.
There is a little red steam engine that says Lincoln Logs on each side of it, a little train car that looks like it can carry things (put some small logs in here, perhaps?
), and a little red caboose.
They all link together easily and move very smoothly around the track.
The Lincoln Logs themselves are fantastic as always.
There are over 200 pieces here in a wide variety of lengths/types.
They build a train station, a building that looks like an inn, and a smaller building all simultaneously (as shown on the box).
There is a large fold-open instruction sheet that tells step by step how to build these.
But of course, you can get creative and build anything you want here, as the possibilities are nearly endless with this many pieces!
This set also includes three really nice roof pieces.
One large blue one for the train station (that has a sticker on the roof showing a train on a track at a crossing), and a large red roof piece that has two stickers on it simulating windows (such as for an attic), and a smaller yellow roof piece.
There is also a plastic door and a plastic window, both yellow.
And there is a little cowboy who is fit for riding the included white horse, and a little train conductor/engineer.
I had Lincoln Logs as a kid and truthfully, I loved them more than Legos.
I got these for my 4 year old daughter and they have been a huge hit.The directions/guide to build the buildings are easy-to-follow.
The plastic trains are sturdy and the cowboy figures and horses are nice as well.My only complaint is that I wish these had come with a carrying case.
The box just doesn't cut it.
Other than that, these are great.
Lincoln Logs have been around for many years.
This set is just as good as other Lincoln Log sets I have purchased and watched my children play with.
If you like Lincoln Logs and the creative play time they inspire, you will like this set.
This set of Lincoln Logs is a lot of fun for my granddaughter.
I had given my her a frontier cabin set last Christmas and she has played with it over and over again ever since, so I knew she'd enjoy this set as well.
She loves it even more than the cabin set.
The train set with the engineer, horse and cowboy are fun for her, and train gives her something to actually do with the set, rather than just build it and knock it down (not that she doesn't love that, too).The set is mostly made up of the small logs and there are only a few longer logs so I thought it would be difficult to build different configurations, but it doesn't seem to have bothered my granddaughter as she builds all kinds of structures.The only real complaint I have about the set is that once opened, there is nothing to put the logs back into.
The box came rather badly damaged (if the parts hadn't been in plastic bags then I think a lot of them would have been lost) and so it was not possible to put the parts back into it.
The cabin set I bought came in a big tin which is great for storing logs.
I bought a mesh laundry bag from the dollar store and put the logs & parts into that.
Then I put the bag into the tin with the other set (luckily there was plenty of room).
That has solved the storage problem.I recommend this and any other Lincoln Logs set.
You can't go wrong with a durable, interesting and educational product that has been around for so many years.
I found that my parents still had some of the Lincoln Logs I and my siblings had played with 40 years ago and I have added those to the sets that I have given my grandchildren.
I'm sure that when my grandson gets old enough, he will also love to play with this set and they will be able to pass it down to their children and so on.
Some things never change...  Lincoln logs seem to be one of those things.
These are pretty much just like I remembered them.
The box comes with a fair amount of them, so you can build the set up pictured on the front of the box or you can freelance and have fun on your own.
If you buy them I hope you are as happy as I was and thanks for taking the time to read my review.
