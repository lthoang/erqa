Top sentence(s):
happened so early in the timeline!
It comes in a nice embossed tin and the cards, although smallish, are all done with a nice matte finish.
I am going to order a few extra's to keep on hand as birthday gifts and definitely for Christmas time!
If this is not your belief's, then I think you'll really enjoy the game.
There are a few additional rules, but that's mostly it.Most of the cards are about inventions, like the invention of the safe or the invention of saxophone.

Reviews:
The product quality is top-notch for this game.
It comes in a nice embossed tin and the cards, although smallish, are all done with a nice matte finish.
Love the art style too.
Me and the wife played this last night and had fun, it went quickly, less than ten minutes.
The only thing I had an issue with, and this is my family's issue, is that we are young earth Creationists so the billion's of years timeline had us rolling our eyes.
If this is not your belief's, then I think you'll really enjoy the game.
As a matter of fact, it would be cool if they came out with a Bible-based version of this game to teach kids and adults Biblical timelines.It's a great concept and I think people will enjoy it.
I have to admit, I was kind of surprised that I was sent a game from 2010 to review for Amazon Prime.
After all, they usually want you to review new things.
I'm glad they did send this however, as Timeline: Inventions was a lot of fun and a surprising hit in our household.The game comes in an oversize metal case.
Now I say oversized for the cards, which are very tiny.
These cards are not playing card size but maybe a third of that.
There are also 109 cards in the deck which can be a bit of a bear for shuffling.
Now the small size of the cards is no doubt what helps keep the cost of this game so amazingly low, but it also means the print on the cards can be hard to read for older gamers or those with bad eyesight.Once you get used to shuffling such a large stack of cards, you'll find the game easy to play but hard to master unless you are especially affluent with historical dates.
After all, the game is all about putting the cards in chronological order.
A history major or professor will have a much easier time with this game than say, a nine year old or someone who was better at math and science.
Still, the game can be vexing when you have two cards with a decade (or less) of each other.The game starts with one card flipped date side up as the starting point of the timeline.
Then players are dealt their hand (which varies based on the number of players).
These cards are all date side down and should never be flipped over until player.
The first player chooses a card from his or her hand and puts it either in front of (occurring before) or behind (occurring after) the starting card.
Then they flip it over and look at the date the object was invented.
If correct, they card is placed in the timeline.
If incorrect, the card is discarded, and the player must draw a new card.
"This game is very easy to play: you play one card each turn, and guess where it fits relative to the other inventions on the board / that other people have played... and then you're either right or wrong (discard the mistake and draw a new card).
So the front has a picture of an invention, and the back has a picture plus a date.What makes it fantastic is that it's simple, addictive, and fun.
We started with things like the invention of the typewriter, lightning rod, and polio vaccine... and then someone got ""stone tools.""
That seemed easy until another person got ""pottery"" and another got ""iron.""
So the inventions range from far, far, prehistoric times up until fairly recent (for example, ""laptop computer"").
It was interesting and surprising to see where some things fell relative to each other (the motorcycle was invented DECADES before the car), but rather than getting discouraged, my kids (ages 7 and 9) were excited and intrigued, and ready to see the next item on the list.
It was also a fun opportunity to talk to them about ""the stone age"" and ""the iron age"" and ""the bronze age,"" and how/where/when paper was invented.
I really wish the cards themselves would tell you more about such things, but I guess there's always Google for that :-P The important thing is that the game kindled my children's imagination and curiosity.Oh, and when my 9-year-old wanted to store the game in her bedroom (presumably so she could memorize the cards)?
If I were a game fanatic I might complain about cheating, but as a parent, if my 9-year-old wants to memorize 200 key dates in history, I can only think that's fantastic!
I hope she does :)"
This is an easy game to explain.
Play a card from your tableau into the common timeline, based on where in the timeline it fits.
You are either correct, or incorrect; the first person to place all of his/her cards correctly in the timeline wins.
How easy is it to do this?
Last night we had two adults with 4 history degrees between them playing against a 6th grader.
It should have been a massacre, but was actually quite competitive.
If you get a batch of cards where the inventions all took place between 1830 and 1880, for example, getting the event EXACTLY right can be tricky.Obviously, if someone wants to take the time to commit all 100-plus cards to memory, then game's replay value drops considerably.
I suspect that this is easier said than done, and in any case, there are several expansions available which can will keep the base game sufficiently fresh.Lots of fun, easy to set up and explain, reasonably brief, and even a bit educational.
Highly recommended for kids and families, or as an entertaining filler for your gaming group.
"The game ""Timeline"" is extremely easy to play - note I'm not saying its an easy game - its just easy to play (get the difference?).
Each card has two sides: one side has just a title (such as ""The Taming of Fire"") and the other side has both the title and a date (such as -10,000).
So after dealing out the cards you put one card down (with the year side face up) in between all the players and this is the foundational card that all the players build off.
Then the first player puts down his card (year side down) on either the left or right of the starting card (designating that his guess is that the invention on HIS/HER card was either older or younger than the starter) and then once he chooses, he flips the card to see if he/she was correct.
If he/she was, then the card is left in place - if not, the card is discarded and the player draws another card.
After either of these outcomes, it is the next person's turn and he/she selects one of his cards to determine where in the building timeline his card will go and so on until one player successfully places his last card.
Game play for adults can be as little as 5 min, if there are only two players and both are somewhat knowledgeable of historical events, or 20-25 min if you are playing with younger children (game play is suggested for ages 8 and up) or larger groups.
My wife and I played three games back to back to back and we were done in 30 min - and that included reading the instructions and figuring out the game play the first time around.The game cards are very attractive and sturdy with really nice pictures on them.
The card are somewhat on the small side - although I think that this decision was made in order to not have your ""timeline"" become way too long when playing with four players.
I'm not going to kill Asmodee for making a functionality decision based on anticipated game play.
The game box is also a nice metal tin that can take a good beating, but is also pretty light.
As per the actual game play, one thing to note is you MUST MUST MUST shuffle the cards very well right out the box (and this is somewhat tedious due to the small size of the cards).
The reason for this is that the cards are in chronological order when you get them so once or twice through the deck and the game will get VERY hard as approximately half of the deck is for the years from 1800 to the Present.
My wife and I played an entire game where all of the cards we drew were from 1850-1910 so the choices became extremely hard when trying to fit your card into the existing timeline.That brings me to a major point - in my opinion Asmodee has way too many invention cards from 1800-1950 years.
While some of them are good, the inclusion of the card ""The Invention of the Saxaphone"" (in 1846, I think) is pretty estoric, and the inclusion of so many cards in such a small time period makes the game a little more difficult to play than it should be.
It is also pretty sparse for the last 25-50 yrs.
Timeline: Inventions is one of many sets of cards in the Timeline series.The game pits player's temporal cognizance against each other to lay down inventions in a row, in the order in which they were invented.One card starts on the table, and the starting player can choose any one of their cards and place it before or after the face-up card.
Each player in turn does the same, placing cards before, after, or in-between cards.If a card is placed correctly, that player's turn is over.
But if it was placed incorrectly (out of chronological order), that card is returned to the box and the player draws another.Once a round is over (every player has taken one turn), if a sole player has played their last card, they win.
If 2+ players have played their last card, all player with cards remaining drop out, and the players with no cards draw a single card, and play continues until only one player has played their last card, and then becomes the winner.Exact knowledge isn't required to play this game.
It will help, but guessing or estimating if an invention was made before or after other wise will likely be the main way non-historians will play.
Over time and with repeat play sessions, players are likely to remember the years on the cards, and play will become easier.When this happens, add replayability by getting another Timeline deck and mix the cards up and the thrill of placing a card and the letdown of being off by a three years, or the thrill of placing a card right between where it belong, will refresh, adding new live to the game.Timelines: Inventions, as well as the other decks, are educational, and the game play is fun.
This game is recommended for a filler game, as well as an educational activity.
We're a family a game players, be it board games (most likely), card games, or video games (least likely.)
And for the most part, we look for certain things in our games.
Unfortunately, this game lacks several of those features.First, the replay value of this game diminishes very quickly.
We've played probably a dozen times over the weekend, and now we're at the stage of &#34;I've had all these cards before,&#34; and we're starting to memorize the general era of the inventions that we didn't already know, if not the exact date.
Given another week, we likely won't be playing this at all.Second, and to us it's pretty important, is that this game is lacking any sort of strategy.
The closest to strategy that's possible is to play a card close to the date of another card, in hopes that your opponents next play is made a bit more difficult.
We also don't enjoy many games that require dice as they provide an element of sheer randomness - but...Third, this game isn't based on skill (memorization, maybe?
But at that point, the game is boring.)
Nor is it based on randomness of dice.
It's basically guessing.
You guess at first, hoping to draw some reasonable conclusions.
After you play it several times, you're still guessing unless you have it memorized.Lastly, each time we play a game, that game-play session could basically be a story of who did what, when, and why.
This game doesn't provide any kind of recap or postmortem after the game is completed.
It just, thankfully, comes to an end.For us, we're sticking with games like Ticket to Ride, Agricola, and Scotland Yards...  while this game was fun for a few days, it's already lost its appeal, and I don't plan on buying a bunch more cards in order to make it more interesting for a few more days.Wouldn't recommend this...
The game concept is very easy.
Timeline has 109 different small cards each with a historical event on one side (ie The Invention of The Bicycle) and the date on the other (1817).
Players are dealt 6 cards, less if there are more than 6 players (the game can support up to 8).
Each player takes turn placing their card on a timeline in relationship to the other cards in the field.
So if The Invention of The Metric System (1799) was out then you'd play the Invention of The Bicycle (1817) to the right of it.
If you place the card correctly on the time line you are less one card, if not, you place the card on a discard pile and draw a new card.
The first player to play all their cards wins.As you go the timeline gets more filled and so the precision of dates becomes much more important.
It's a game that lasts 15-20 mins and we played it with our family (aged 7-43).
At first when we opened the box, I was surprised at how small the cards are for this game, but as we played it became apparent how important having smaller cards is (as the timeline grows, big cards would be unmanageable).The amazing thing about this game is the difference between when you THINK something was invented and when it actually was.
The increased complexity as  you go and the surprise factor of when things actually happened make this a very entertaining game.
I'd also file it into the friendly game space as you're really playing against your own ability to figure out when things were invented rather than trying to beat your opponents.The game comes in a small tin making it an easy travel game (although you need a good playing area to actually play).
Simple, fun, educational and entertaining.
Five Stars for a quick fun card based game!
We have the inventions and historical editions of Timeline and we love them.
The invention pack is a great addition.We generally don't really play with rules.
We mostly just enjoy figuring out where things fit in the scheme of things.
The cards are small so you can play a lot more of them in your space.
You can easily store all three editions in one box.We homeschool and this is hands down my favorite history tool.
This is better than any timeline book or chart.
Go ahead and get all three.
This game is genius!
Fun, challenging and learning at the same time!
I can't wait to get some of the of the additional sets.
This is definitely a great choice for all ages to play and learn, we had loads of fun playing this while camping over this past holiday weekend.
I am going to order a few extra's to keep on hand as birthday gifts and definitely for Christmas time!
Only thing I would change is the size of the cards, they are really small, and would benefit being two steps larger.
Do not hesitate to order this, great game!
This trivia game is a fun way to learn history, but it's poorly constructed and more educational than enjoyable.
I do believe it has its place in a history or perhaps even a science classroom.
It might even have a place in a home with a family that loves history and trips to museums and historic landmarks.
Unfortunately, my family isn't like that.
In fact, my teenager didn't even want to sit through one game, because, in her words, &#34;History is boring.&#34;I do, however, believe this game could make history less boring in the right context.
I mean, it's probably more fun than an actual history lesson, right?
And I'm sure the game would also be fun to anyone who already likes history.The rules of the game are extremely simple.
You get between six to four cards, depending on the number of players.
Based on the current timeline in front of you, you pick a card from your deck and place it where you think it should go in the timeline: either before, after, between, or adjacent to the cards already in play.
Once you put your card down, you turn it over to look at the date.
If you placed it right, the card remains in the timeline and your turn is over until the next round.
If you didn't, your card is discarded and you have to draw a new card.
The game continues until one player at the end of a round is left with an empty hand.
There are a few additional rules, but that's mostly it.Most of the cards are about inventions, like the invention of the safe or the invention of saxophone.
Some, though, are about other historic events.
For example, there's a card for the discovery of a vaccine for rabies, a card for the date Lord of the Rings was first published, and a card for the year Mount Rushmore was completed.
Unless you buy the myriad expansion packs, you'll quickly learn a lot of these delightful bits of history trivia, which means the game gets less and less fun since it's less and less of a challenge.It's also a game you can't play with people with different exposure - someone who's played it a dozen times will reliably beat any newbies, unless they happen to memorize wikipedia pages in their spare time.That said, the first few rounds are fun, and funny, and educational.
And we will buy a few expansion packs to make it harder to remember whether reading glasses were invented before or after Joan of Arc died.
"This is an especially great game for homeschool or school because you end up learning while playing a game.Quite simply each player gets the allotted number of cards and they are placed in front of each player with the date side down.The first card is picked from the draw pile and placed date side up.Each player, in turn, tries to place their card with its invention in chronological order next to the other cards- all the while not seeing the actual date.
So for example if the ""saxofon"" card is placed on the table (invention date 1846) the next player might have a card ""the invention of the locomotive"" That player (without seeing the date) would have to decide if the locomotive came before (thereby placing the card to the left of the ""saxofon"" OR after (thereby placing the locomotive card to the right of the saxofon) The locomotive was invented in 1804 so if the card was played to the left that player does not have to draw a card and the next player takes his/her turn.The cards are quite small and it comes in a metal tin so it is a great take-along game.I would recommend this game for 9 years and up.
You can play with 2 to 8 players."
This is a fun game that takes about 10 minutes or so to play with two people.
I like it because it is fun trying to figure out the &#34;timeline&#34; if you don't already know.
I am sure at some point one could learn all the answers and be good enough at the game that it would be no fun for the competitor, but for the low price of twelve dollars, I figure I can get several hours of enjoyment out of it.
That isn't much more than going to see a bad movie for only a hour and a half or so.
So for time per dollar, I would say this is a decent game at a very good price.
Also, the cards are nicely done, fun to look at, and add to the enjoyment of the game.
I read the reviews that said this game is 'small' and 'great for travel' but I had no idea how petite it really was!
The tin is small, and so are the cards but there's a lot of fun packed into this fairly educational game and my kids all enjoyed playing it.
This one is 'historical events' and it seemed like it would be an easy game.
Sometimes it is easy.
Sometimes it isn't so much!
I was surprised to find certain events and inventions.
happened so early in the timeline!
This would be an even more fun and educational game if you use a person to do some 'research' on their ipad while playing it to give additional insight.
All in all, a fun and sometimes challenging game.
Plus, since it is so small it would be a wonderful game to take on vacation.
Everything it needs is self-contained in its little tin.
(all it consists of is two TINY deck of cards, and instructions).
Still we had a great time.
As a serious gamer (someone who owns hundreds of games and has previously owned hundreds more) I can say Timeline is that rare game that is both fun and educational.
Those two terms almost never go together as the vast majority of &#34;educational&#34; games are just horrible horrible games.I actually own more than one of the Timeline sets.
They're all good.
While I recommend all of them, there are some issues.First, Amazon's title is incomplete.
This is for the INVENTIONS edition.
Don't know why Amazon is confusing things by omitting that important detail.
I ordered this thinking this was the general version as I already owned Inventions.
So don't make the same mistake I did.While I really like this game and I will continue to buy other editions, I do have some beefs.1.
The cards are too small.
There's some really great artwork on these cards.
It's a shame that you can't fully appreciate it more.
Plus, it makes the game harder as the artwork offers clues.2.
The game ultimately needs multiple editions.
If you're going to play this you're going to want more cards because otherwise it will get stale.
So if you're in for a penny on this one you're in for a pound.
The end result is a game that costs about $40.
This is our second set in the Timeline series.
We also own the Historical Events pack.
Like the Historical Events pack, everything about this set is high quality.
The cards come in a full color embossed tin.
The cards sit in perfectly sized slots in a black velvet-like holder inside with thumb holes to retrieve the cards easily.
The cards are the perfect glossiness, thick, and finely textured.
The whole package is quite tactile.The artwork on the cards is extremely enjoyable.
My only gripe about the cards themselves is that they are small.
I would love to see a full sized deck to showcase the unique art.The game play itself is straightforward and can be taught in 2 minutes or less.
The timeline inventions range from pivotal moments that changed the course of history, such as:The Taming of FireThe Invention of the Printing PressThe Introduction of the Metric SystemThe Invention of the Steam EngineBut what really makes the game enjoyable are some of the less monumental inventions mixed in such as:The Invention of WhiskeyThe Invention of Role Playing GamesThe Invention of the Pull-Tab CanI heartily recommend this entire series, especially if you have children 8 or older.
The game is just as enjoyable with 2 people as it is with 4.
Rounds can be kept simple and somewhat fast (5-10 minutes) by only dealing 5 cards to each player, or make the game more difficult by giving each player 10 cards.It is a not so subversive, but fun, way to anchor important dates in your head.
Also, as the game is being played, when one looks at all the cards lined up, it allows you to make mental connections about the changes happening in the world at that time or how events combined to make other events.Mix the decks together for more fun.
I intend to buy the entire series.
