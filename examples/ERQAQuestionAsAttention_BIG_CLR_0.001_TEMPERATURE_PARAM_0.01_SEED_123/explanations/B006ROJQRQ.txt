Reviews:
I think this product is great in many ways.
First the case is plastic, adding to its durability with a handle for travel ease.
The pieces are that of a regualar size puzzle.
I think it would be perfect for a 3-4 year old.
My son at age five, had this done in no time flat, so it didn't hold him for long.
For a Thomas train fan, it's great!
My almost 4 year-old son loves putting this puzzle together by himself.
Thomas is one of his favorite characters, and Ravensburger puzzles are always the best.
The puzzle itself is sturdy and high-quality, and if we can just keep all the pieces from getting lost, we'll enjoy it for years to come.
The carrying case has a clear plastic window on one side that will most likely crack or pop out within a few months.
I am probably going to try to duct tape along the inside to help secure it in place.
Unfortunately, the only picture of the puzzle is on the case itself, so we'll try to keep the case intact as long as possible.
As far as a puzzle goes this one is fine.
Bright, colorful, pieces on ours were cut out well and fit together easily.
They are also fairly big and just the right amount for a young child.The only draw back is the case.
For whatever reason they decided to use this ackward huge cardboard piece instead of fitting the cardboard into the top of the case.
Since the case is lightweight (not overly durable though) they should have just made the picture of the finished puzzle fit into a be part of the case.
Aside from that though a recommended product.
My 4 yo enjoyed doing this puzzle.
The pieces are sturdy and fit together nicely.
Perfectly sized for toddlers.
The carrying case is a great addition.
No more lost puzzle pieces.
Overall, this is a good quality item.
A great puzzle for kids.
My son likes Thomas and the birthday party theme makes it great for any birthday boy or girl.
I recommend it.
My youngest loves Thomas and he likes trying out new things, so he thoroughly enjoyed this toy.
This isn't an extremely difficult puzzle, so it wasn't frustrating to build.When playing with puzzles, my kid likes to build them and take them apart right after only rebuild them again at some other time.
Thus, although the case quality could have been improved upon, having a case is very helpful in keeping the pieces organized and making sure that he doesn't lose any of them.
Thomas of course is an excellent series for the preschool child, in praticular thos narrated by Mr. Starr, as inThomas The Tank Engine And Friends - The Early Years (3-Disc Set).Here we find a 35 piece puzzle of Thomas, rather on the outside of the preschool powers, but excellent for parent and child to share together, as are the books, etc.
This is my 4 year old's first puzzel and she loves it!
The pieces are big enough for her to handle with ease and she could match some of them together herself.
Great product.
My 3 year old nephews absolutely LOVE Thomas, so I try to get anything Thomas related for gifts.
They were super excited to open this puzzle!The carrying case is really nice - I almost want to put the puzzle pieces in a bag and use the box to hold all their Thomas trains.
It snaps shut, is quite secure, and is difficult enough to open that the 3 year old won't be dumping puzzle pieces all over the place.The puzzle is a little challenging for 3 year olds - they definitely need help completing it.
It's probably geared more towards 5 year olds.The pieces are pretty durable, and will hold together for some time.
Overall, this is a great puzzle!
This 35 piece puzzle was a little challenging.
The right side of the picture is not very detailed making it a little harder than usual.The puzzle is a little smaller than I expected, the piece are fairly small but durable.But the case is what make this puzzle special.
My kids thinks it is the coolest thing.Overall a good buy
"This wonderful puzzle has kept my three-year-old busy even though he has a difficult time actually solving it.
It of course helps that he loves `Thomas and Friends' as if it was birthday cake.
The pieces are large enough to be easily manipulated by small hands while being sturdy enough to weather the occasional tantrum.
The box is strong as well.I do wish the ""complete picture"" were larger, but my son and I both love working this puzzle.
5 stars."
This puzzle comes in a cute handy blue plastic suitcase with handle.
The front of the suitcase is clear plastic film and I can envision it becoming damaged by an over excited toddler, but so far it is holding up.
Inside the suitcase is a removable cardboard picture of the final puzzle.
There is a sticker on the back side of the suitcase with the picture too.
The puzzle pieces are cardboard and fit together well.
The final puzzle is 7 pieces wide by 5 pieces high which corresponds to approximately 11.5 x 8 inches when assembled.I got this for my 20 month old granddaughter, which is obviously pushing the lower age limit, but she will eventually get there with enough practice.
She is already putting some simple puzzle pieces together.
For now it takes considerable interactive assistance for her to be able to do it, but she has the general idea in play.
It is a good puzzle.
I think puzzles are a wonderful way to stimulate young children to think how things go together.
This puzzle is a great way to entertain young children while teaching them to problem solve at the same time.
This is a colorful, attractive 35-piece puzzle that is about the size of a sheet of paper when assembled.
The pieces are very durable cardboard, fit together beautifully, and are about 1.5 inches square.
The plastic carrying  case is a nice idea, but could have been made better.
The plastic film across the front is not going to last (should have used rigid plastic), and the plastic is very thin and the hinges are going to break off one of these days.
The peices are thick so I don't see having any problem with them, they'll last a while.
I like that he can store them in the box.
He loves the picture that the puzzle makes, it just didn't hold his interest for more than the time that it took us to put it together.
Granted, he's wanted to put it together more than once but each time it only holds his attention long enough to do it once.
As long as we keep it in the box so we don't lose the peices I can see him keeping it and wanting to play with it for at least the next few months.
This is a great puzzle for anyone 4 and up.
My kids are 5 and have little trouble with it after doing it a few times.
As such, I think it's a great confidence booster since they can pick it up and get through this nicely and feel like a champ afterwards.The case is sturdy.
The fact that it snaps closed and has a handle makes cleanup time fun, and a snap.
Thomas.
Puzzle.
Pretty much says it all.
My child loves these, it took him about 20 minutes to complete the first time, much faster each time.
I really like these cases, as it provides a more durable box to corral puzzle pieces when the kids are done.
I just hope the clear plastic on the front does not puncture too easily...
My 4 year old son is getting tired of the same four 24-piece puzzles that we own, so I thought this 35-piece puzzle would offer him a slight challenge.
He was able to do the puzzle just as quickly as his puzzles with less pieces, so I guess it wasn't enough of a challenge.
That being said, it's a pretty standard kids' puzzle.
Flimsy cardboard, but again, it's standard.The carrying case is kind of cool (and my kid loves it)... but it isn't very high quality.
Also, the picture of the completed puzzle is printed on what appears to be the top of a regular puzzle box, so it's quite awkward trying to get the pieces and the puzzle picture into the box.
My kid has to have me help him put it away every time.
I'll probably end up cutting the picture out and just taping it inside the suitcase to make it easier on him.
I think this puzzle is very cute and will be appreciated by young Thomas fans.
However, it is not appropriate for a 3-year-old.
The pieces are too small and there are too many of them.
The toddler who tried it for me got frustrated easily.
For children that young, I would recommend one of the Thomas floor puzzles, which have *much* larger pieces and fewer pieces.Pros:It's Thomas -- what's not to like?It has a nice plastic carrying case with latches.
While not the sturdiest, it will be sturdier than your standard cardboard puzzle box.Colors are bright.Pieces are nice size for a slightly older child.
I would say 5 and up.Cons:Pieces too small for the 3-year-old child the box says it is appropriate for.Too many pieces for a toddler, too.Pieces are thin cardboard, like most puzzles, so they won't stand up to much abuse.
But most puzzles will not, anyway.Overall, if you have a Thomas fan who is 5 or older (or even a mature 4-year-old), this would be a cute gift that will enhance the child's hand dexterity, spatial perception, and planning skills.
First I love the carrying case.
My grandson has carried this puzzle everywhere he has gone in the past week!
First he it together with just a little help from grandpa.
Then he had to show his uncle, then his mom, then his dad how it goes together.
It was even a hit at the daycare!
He is 4 and the pieces are perfect size and go together easily.Top Notch Product!
"My son is three years, three months old, and we opened up this Thomas & Friends puzzle for the first time about two weeks ago.
He adores Thomas, and this being his second Thomas puzzle, he was thrilled to see it.
I knew that the age range on this was a little beyond his capacity, but I also knew he'd have it for a long time, and anything Thomas is a plus for him.
His other puzzle is a 20-piece (this one being a 35-piece), and that one is definitely more his speed.
But we spent one morning with this ""Cleaning"" puzzle and had a great time together, Dad giving him hints and being as enthusiastic as possible.It really is a little too difficult for him for now, but he loves the Thomas carrying case and when he gets a little older, we'll revisit this puzzle.
I am definitely going to keep it boxed up and on a shelf for a while because even after the one play session we had with it, corners and the bulbous parts of the pieces were in a clearly poorer state of repair.
The pieces aren't as sturdy as I thought they should be even for a four or five year old puzzler; they are thin and easily dog-eared.
Care is needed when in use.The artwork and colors are sharp and crisp, and as I mentioned before, the case adds to the enjoyability of the puzzle.All things considered, this is a nice puzzle for a four to six year old, but I think five to six range is even better.
I do recommend!"
Since my grandson is rather entranced by Thomas the Train Engine, I thought he would enjoy this puzzle.I keep it hidden, until one evening when his mother was attempting to bead and he was getting in her way.He was quite interested in it, and I showed him how to put the puzzle together, overall not too hard to put together for a 54 year old Grandma, even upside down, since I wanted it to be the right side up from his perspective.I thought at age 4 1/2 he would be able to put the puzzle together, but at first he kept coming to either grandma or mom for help.After a couple of days, he was able to put it together himself.The puzzle is made out of sturdy cardboard and the storage box is a very nice bonus, making it easier to keep all 35 pieces together in one place.Overall I recommend this toy, with just one caution, even though my grandson does not try to put toys in his mouth, and I do not consider the toy to be a choking hazard, keep an eye on your toddler or pre-schooler, since my grandson expressed his frustration at the puzzle one evening by tearing one of the puzzle pieces in half.
It was repairable, but still makes the puzzle less likely to be a long term toy in terms of durability
I guess I didn't look at the size of this puzzle before I selected it.
I just noticed it had 35 pieces.
The case it is in isn't very big.
It has a clear front (so they could use this with other puzzles they sell) with a cardboard insert with the picture on it.
I don't see either the case or the cardboard holding up very long.
The tabs that keep the case shut look pretty fragile and the cardboard will either get separated from the case and puzzle or get torn up.The age says 3+.
Having 3 year old twin grandchildren (boy and a girl), I think the pieces are too small for them.
I got a different puzzle by this same company that was bigger, but had fewer pieces.
It was much better for them.
It was easier for them to work together and their still developing small motor control was not frustrated by pieces that were too small for them.
I think this one will frustrate them.
My 5 year old grandson is better suited to this puzzle.The pieces do fit together well.
It does form a 7 piece by 5 piece rectangle and the edges are smooth making them easy to pick out.
The picture has enough detail which should make it easier for a young child.
This is not a big puzzle, so it fits nicely on a table.
You don't have to spread out on the floor.
This is my THIRD Thomas & Friends Ravensburger puzzle.
I must say this is my least favorite.
First and foremost, the case was a lot smaller than I anticipated.
The product dimensions are listed (8 x 6.1 x 1.7 inches ; 8.3 ounces), but I guess I didn't pay close enough attention to the description.
Honestly, the case is rather low-quality and I expect the latches to be broken or non-functioning quickly.
Although the puzzle is recommended for ages 3+, I believe the small pieces (35) are a bit too challenging and SMALL for a three-year-old.
The last thing I would want to do is FRUSTRATE my three-year-old great nephew with an educational toy.
The puzzle pieces are made of a high quality cardboard, so supervision is advisable to keep the pieces from getting damaged in the mouths of children.
And, as stated, I would be concerned about the potential choking hazard for small children.
The puzzle does feel so much more 'authentic' than many of the plastic puzzles designed for younger children.
Of course, the puzzle is manufactured by Ravensburger which is a age-old and respected puzzle company.
The pieces fit together as near to perfection as you could possibly expect.
The puzzle is bright and visually pleasing.
I believe if you take the time to build the puzzle with your child it will be a great learning experience.
But, I would not recommend this puzzle as a do-it-yourself toy for a three-year-old and I am not impressed with the carrying case.
My son loves Thomas, he loves puzzles, and he takes care of his toys, so this was perfect.
He thought it was really neat that the puzzle came with its own tote case.
I like that it's more durable than the usual cardboard box that most puzzles come in.
