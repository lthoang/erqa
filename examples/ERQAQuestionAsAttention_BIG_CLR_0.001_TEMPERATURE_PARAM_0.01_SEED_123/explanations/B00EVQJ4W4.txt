The sound is a huge negative for me.
Especially Spiderman enthusiasts!
It would be better and more fun if you could load and shoot all 10.
If you have other nerd guns, you know that the plastic can take a hit.If you like Spider-Man this toy would be exciting.
But my Spidey sense tells me this is a causal toy -- something to take with you outside every so often, not something that would be in play every day by a child of any age.

Reviews:
Although I ordered this web blaster for my six year old son, my two year daughter and my husband have enjoyed playing with this just as much as my son has.
There is a strap on the bottom of the blaster that should fit most averaged size children ages 4 and up.
By squeezing the handle the motorized web blaster will shoot out a flying foam disc (from the makers of Nerf) that flies a surprisingly far distance given how lightweight the discs are.
This comes with ten discs but only five can be loaded at one time.
It would be better if all ten could be loaded at once because it runs out of discs so quickly.
As I stated the blaster is motorized therefore this toy is a little noisier than I prefer, however I realize that this is probably the feature that makes this toy so much fun.
This toy really is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it to both Spider-Man fans and fans of Nerf toys.
This is quite a fun toy to play with even if you don't watch the movie it is tied-in with.Playing Spider-Man is always exciting but this toy does have serval drawbacks: the &#34;web&#34; shoots out, albeit there are not as many discs as one would like, and rests on your arm, a bit heavy depending on the child's age.After several play sessions, the toy seems durable.
If you have other nerd guns, you know that the plastic can take a hit.If you like Spider-Man this toy would be exciting.
If you like shooting, this toy might be of interest.
But my Spidey sense tells me this is a causal toy -- something to take with you outside every so often, not something that would be in play every day by a child of any age.
Our kids were filled with excitement when we showed them this toy.
We installed brand new batteries twice, and within a few hours the toy was no longer working.
When it does work, it works great.
It loads easily, and shoots with ease, the only complaint is that it stops working after a few rounds of shooting out the discs.
Most likely a defect to this particular unit, but our kids now use their imagination, instead of constantly replacing the batteries.
Pretty high quality considering most plastic toys these days.My only complaint is its size, which is both very large, and pretty heavy for smaller arms.Also, considering how big this is, only 5 discs fit!
For such a large thing, I can't understand why more disc space was not made available.My only other complaint is yet again, we see a battery compartment that requires a screwdriver.
ARGHH.
Dad's toy nemesis - the screwed down battery compartment.Performance-wise, the shooting part is great, the foam discs are soft enough to not hurt, and really fly well.Overall, a great accompaniment to the Spider Man mask, which is aces IMO.
If you have a young fan of Spidey in your house, you've probably experienced the shared disappointment with &#34;web shooter&#34; toys that really are just spraying silly string all over the place.
The Amazing Spider-Man 2 Motorized Spider Force Web Blaster substitutes some Nerf gun action instead and the results are a hit with the seven-year-old crowd!
The Blaster is a bit bulky and heavy but attaches nicely to their arm.
The controls in the hand grip are easy to use for even the smallest of hands and the loading door is also simple to grasp and operate.
It makes a bit of motor noise when launching the discs, but in all likelihood, much less noise than the kids playing with it!The Blaster comes with ten of the discs and my only worry is that I'm not sure how/where to buy replacement ones when these inevitably find their way into the great who-know-where.
This is essentially a disc shooter with Spider-Man decor designed to be worn on the forearm.
This is rather bulky for a disc shooter.
The toy comes in 2 pieces in the package - the bulky shooter housing and the trigger handle that you simply snap together.
3x AA batteries are required but not supplied.Ten foam discs are supplied but only 5 can be loaded in the shooter at a a time.
The shooter has an adjustable strap that helps secure itself on the forearm.
The on-off rocker switch is on the left rear corner of the shooter and is easily accessible if worn on the right arm.
You will have to first turn it on, and the motor will spin constantly making a noisy running motor sound.
You then squeeze the trigger on the handle to fire a disc at a time.
It doesn't shoot the disc as fast as a NERF gun does and can travel up to 20 feet.
The disc is made of foam so it's rather harmless.
However, I would still advise the kids to not aim at people's face and especially the eyes.The discs are loaded at the top through a flip cover.
It's possible to flip open the cover with the other hand while wearing the shooter.
The battery compartment is at the top rear of the shooter and requires a screwdriver to open it.The disc shooting works without any problem.
The reason I gave it a 3 star is that it is unnecessarily bulky.
It would be easy and more thoughtful to come up with a slimmer design that achieves the same result but fits a young child's forearm better.
Also, they could have put in a timer to auto switch off the noisy motor.
I'm titling this &#34;two and done&#34; because that's how many times &#34;the boy&#34; used it before setting it aside.
Am I the only one who thinks kids today are way too quick to move on to other toys?
(By which I mean bored :)Be aware, this thing is loud.
And requires batteries.
It works by using air pressure to push these soft, blue disks quite a ways.
There's a trigger in the handle activated by squeezing the fist.
It does require a screwdriver to put together; Nothing too bad, about 10 minutes.
Underneath is a plastic strap that holds the kid's forearm in place.
It's a little unwieldy initially but it's definitely secure, and maybe too much!
Loading the foam disks--of which there are 10--five at a time into the flip-top is easy, and while it's possible to fit six disks, it will refuse to work with anything more than five.I have to confess, I do like this even in spite of the noise.
Turning it on and off is difficult because the switch is hard to manipulate and for that, I'm deducting a few points.
Nevertheless, I'm sure he'll come back to play with it after he gets bored with something else because it's fun to shoot disks at dad's head.
3.5 stars.
This is a Spiderman-themed disc launcher from the makers of Nerf.
The idea of the toy is nothing new.
Nerf has plenty of disc blaster toys, including an almost identical Iron Man 3 themed blaster.
The reason to buy this toy over the others is for the Spiderman theme.The web blaster comes with 10 &#8220;webs&#8221; (blue foam discs with white web pattern), but can only hold six discs per load (5 is recommended).
The unit requires three AA batteries (not included) and turns on via a rather small switch on the back left side.The toy is worn like a gauntlet over the forearm.
Turn it on and pull the trigger with your fingers.
The discs do get good distance!
It&#8217;s lots of fun for kids!
Especially Spiderman enthusiasts!
Avoid rotating your arm much though because the discs are just gravity fed into the launcher.
The discs shouldn't hurt or damage anything inside the house since they are so lightweight and soft.
I think replacement discs could easily be made with craft foam sheets and a circle cutter.The most annoying thing about this toy is the motor sound.
It&#8217;s noisy and sounds like a handheld vacuum cleaner &#8211; the entire time the toy is on.
The sound is a huge negative for me.
I don&#8217;t understand why it is that loud.
There is no auto-off feature, so you have to depend upon your children to turn it off after they are done - or kill batteries.
Just gave this to my 5 yo.
Grandson.He loved it.It comes with 10 round light weight rubbery but ridged  disc's.. Only 5 of them fit in the  Blaster at a time .
You have to open the top where the spider is to put in the discs..It took him a few times to be able to open it.The disc sails off far depending how you aim this, Aim high it sails farther...My Grandson used it in my livingroom that is 20 by 30, and it can shoot farther then 20 feet.This was not too heavy for him to hold and shoot with one hand.
Your hand goes threw two types of straps at the bottom of the blaster to hold in place.Of course it would have been more fun if he had two of these to play with a friend..This is also fun if your in a swimming pool , cause the disc's would float.Fun toy..Good to give a young friend for a birthday present etc.
This held the interest of a 4yo and 7yo (boys) for about 30 seconds.
The idea was REALLY cool for them, but once the disks were fired, they abandoned the shooter.
I was surprised, to be honest.
The work to reward ratio leans too much toward work.
This toy could be improved by including some paper targets or something along those line.
The foam discs fly out quickly, safely and with good distance out of the web blaster and you can fire them off fairly quickly.
Overall a lot of fun, but the first time we loaded it, we though it was broken.
You see, blaster comes with 10 discs, but will only fire if you have 5 or less discs in it.
We were able to fit in 6, but the 6th one locks up the mechanics.
If you could load all 10 (or more) at once then this would be a 5 star toy worth well more than the price as it is, it's fun but there's just too much time hunting for ammunition and reloading to be highly recommended.
Movie tie-in toys are usually pretty underwhelming to me, so I was pleasantly surprised by the Amazing Spider-Man 2 Motorized Spider Force Web Blaster.
Why is this one a winner?
It evokes the web slinging power of your favorite hero, but is basically powered by a Nerf technology.
And I love me some Nerf!
The unit itself is rather large and cumbersome.
It gives the age range at 5+, but I think this might be a tad heavy and large for the smaller kids.
The unit itself looks great and is meant to be worn over the hand.
Powered by 3 AA batteries, the unit loads with 5 Nerf discs with a web design stenciled on each one.
You turn the toy on, and shoot the discs up to 20 feet.
It is really quite powerful.Pros:Automatic shut-off when you open compartment to load discs is a nice safety feature.10 discs included so you have extras (it only loads five at a time).Great design.Cons:I really only have one safety concern.
The Web Blaster is large and made of hard plastic.
If your child is excitable and jumping around indoors with this on his hand, it has the potential to wreak absolute destruction.Therefore, I recommend this for outdoor spaces or places where not a lot of breakable items are sitting around!
Plus, I also wouldn't want to take one of these high velocity discs to my eye!
So play nice and everyone wins.
Love this thing!
KGHarris, 5/14.
Toy manufacturers seem to churn our any number of new toys with each new movie and most of these toys are often flashy and hold a child's interest for about five minutes.
This toy is, unfortunately, no exception to this.First and foremost, make sure you have 3 AA batteries for this item as they are not included.Assembly is, quite literally, a snap.
Snap two pieces together, pop in the batteries and you are set to go.An adjustable strap can tighten over your forearm and a fixed grip has a built in trigger that you depress to launch the discs.
There are ten discs included and, while the description claims that you can &#34;unleash a stream of discs&#34;, the device can only load 5 discs at a time.
The discs are made of a soft foam and I don't see them doing too much damage.The most annoying thing about the toy is that you have to turn it on before you can launch the discs.
This causes the unit to produce a constant, irritating, whining noise like that of a handvac.
I can see the kids driving me nuts running around with this noisy toy attached to their arm or just leaving it on for me to hunt down and shut off.If the noise and lack of versatility don't bother you this could be a good toy for a Spidey Fan who likes to play pretend.
This is a lot of fun.
My boys had a lot of fun playing with this.
I went and purchased another.
The boys had a blast.
It shoots far enough for them to enjoy and not to loose.
I  like that it is sturdy and will not drop if you break it.
Kids had a fun playing tag as well.
This way everyone can have fun as well.
My 4 year old nephew LOVES Spiderman, so this was a natural fit for him!
It take is small enough for him to hold easily for shooting.
The discs are foam, so when they hit things (like his little brother) no one/nothing gets hurt, but still sturdy enough to be shot over and over without falling apart.
Loading it is easy and he can do it by himself.
It comes with 10 discs, so if you lose a few, no big deal.
It does take 3 AA batteries that ARE NOT INCLUDED-so have those on hand!
Overall, this is a very fun, easy to use, and his new favorite toy!
I got this for my 5 year old nephew and nieces and they were super excited about it because they love Spiderman.
You get the colorful wrist web blaster and 10 blue foam disks with white web designs on them.
Assembly literally took 10 seconds and just required snapping two pieces together.
To insert the disks, you lift the flap near the spider's head on the top and drop them in, but make sure you press the flap all the way down or it won't work.
The kids loved running around with it pretending they're Spiderman and the web blaster works by using the adjustable strap to strap it on the arm, turning on the switch, and squeezing the trigger.We liked that it shoots the disks really far, up to 20 feet, and you can rapid fire them and quickly reload without taking it off your arm.
As a parent, I like that the disks are foam, so when the kids inevitably &#34;accidentally&#34; shoot each other with them, they won't hurt, though you still don't want them aiming near the face.Now to why it gets 3 stars.
You get 10 disks with it but you can only load 5 into the web blaster so you spend more time reloading than you do actually shooting.
It would be better and more fun if you could load and shoot all 10.
Also, the blaster is very bulky and heavy on the arm, even for 5 year olds.
I was annoyed that batteries were NOT included with this toy and I had to supply my own.
But the biggest reason this gets 3 stars is the NOISE!!
As soon as you turn on the switch it makes a loud, constant whirring noise that sounds like a dustbuster and is extremely annoying even if the kids just play with it for a few minutes.
Definitely, the manufacturers need to find a way to either lower or eliminate the noise because it will drive you crazy!
Overall, the toy is fun but I won't let them play with it inside strictly because of the noise - at least when we're outside, other noises drown it out somewhat.
Despite the flaws, it is a cool toy though.
This blaster fits over the hand just like the real spidey web shooters but instead of sticky spidy web you get the styrofoam discs.
It's a credible alternative to the various nerf bullet blasters and my nine-year-old son is quite taken with it.
All that's missing to make him completely happy are spidy explosions.
My 7 year-old grandson gets a lot of mileage out of this one.The idea of it is that it launches these little discs, which he thinks is the coolest thing in the world.
The discs are light and they won't hurt anyone so there's no worry there.The bottom line is that this is associated with Spider-Man which increases the cool factor substantially.
It's pretty well-made and has already provided hours of fun.Recommended.
My kids loved playing with this.
When loaded with batteries and turned on, the toy spins up with a hum and is ready to shoot discs at the pull of a trigger.The velocity of the discs is pretty low and the discs are a soft foam, so you don't have to worry about any kids getting hurt.
You can probably shoot it in someone's eye without too much of an issue.
The downside is that the discs only shoot about 6-10 feet before dropping to the floor (we were getting nowhere close to the advertised 20 foot range).That's not necessarily bad, though, as it let our kids be in the same room shooting each other and the furniture at short distances.The only thing that kills the fun is you only get 4-5 shots before the discs are out, and then they usually end up under the couch or lost in some nook or cranny, so you spend more time searching that playing.My kids loved it, though, so I'd personally rate it highly.
My son would always pretend to be Spider Man, but this toy has made it even more fun.
This is a great addition to play time.
If my son can keep up with the disc this will be a great toy for him to enjoy for a long time.
I recommend this to others who are looking for a great gift for the kid that loves super heroes.
Gave this to my 6 year old grandson.
He had a good time chasing his younger brother around with it, but little brother  would have like to have his own  to shoot his brother back.
I would suggest buying two so siblings can blast it out.
(a safe way at that)
This is a large foam disc launcher that fits on the end of your arm.
My 9 year old daughter has fun with it.
She likes to try to knock over other toys from across the room.
She is able to load it herself with no problems.
It's large but looks cool.
It makes noise when shooting but isn't very loud.
Getting it free of the packaging was a little bit of a challenge.
I would think this would be a hit with any little Spiderman fan.Notes:- It was a little difficult to get out of the packaging.- Takes 3 AA batteries not included- Comes with 10 discs holds 5 at a time- It's big but feels solid- Shoots discs over 20 feet- Fun for target practice- Safe for indoor fun- Would be nice to have 20 discs
