Reviews:
I selected this toy, knowing that my son was on the tail end for age recommendation.
In retrospect, that was a very good thing.
When this arrived, he saw it and immediately opened the box, took out the instructions, and, within 45 minutes, he had put it together himself.
Each time he put it together, he got faster at it.
He has enjoyed this toy many times since it arrived a few weeks ago and has been building other things with it.I rated it 4 for education mainly because you need to follow the directions to get it together properly.
All kids need to learn to follow the instructions!
The pictures were easy to follow and he had no problem methodically following them to complete the build.I also liked it because most of the parts are big.
This makes clean up easier and you don't have to worry about losing microscopic parts.
My kids love to build tracks and race cars, and this set looked perfect.
My 3-year old has some trouble with legos still, but thinks Duplo blocks are too big.
These blocks are about an inch or so across, and are the perfect size for her.
They snap together easily, even for her little hands.
She has some trouble getting them apart, but had a lot of fun building the ramps for this set.This set includes 93 pieces - plenty of bricks or blocks for building the ramp, some curvy slide material for the race track and a car for the kids to put together.
The instructions were simple easy for me to follow, and while the set has an age range of 3-8, the younger ones will most likely need help.I love that there are so many possibilities with this set.
There are three pictures on the box for different configurations, but with so many pieces my kids have built an endless array of ramps to launch the car.
We have literally spent hours at the kitchen table with this box.
And, with so many pieces, it's OK if one or two bricks gets lost under the table.My only complaint has been durability.
After putting it together and taking it apart for several weeks, some of the connections are not as firm as they used to be.
It's still usable, but I wonder how it will snap together in the coming months.
My kids were so excited to set this toy up.
Because they were so excited, I set to building it quickly to see how easily could be done.
There is an instruction manual that comes with the set with several possible layouts.
This facet of the toy I really liked.
It's design is very versatile.But, the problem with this toy is that it has sat downstairs for the past 3 days since it arrived.
None of my kids are that enthused by it.
My son at 3 1/2 is too young to easily rearrange the pieces of the ramp.
It takes a little bit of strength to push everything together.
I love the idea of trio and the blue blocks are easy to put together, but the long gray bars aren't so easy to push into them.
My 5 and 7 year olds haven't wanted to rearrange it.The other detractor is that in order to use the ramp, you must have a trio car that's the right size to sit on the gray loading ramp.
One does come with the set, but when you have several children, they would like to have their own cars to send down the ramp.I think this toy is a fun toy and has potential, but my son has enjoyed his Imaginext sets a lot more.
If your kids already love the TRIO line, they will probably really love this set.
This was the first TRIO set that my kids have played with so it is new to them and they enjoy Imaginext more.
TRIO Building sets are great, and this set is no exception.
My grandkids, ages four and six, spend hours playing with their TRIO sets.
The Stunt Ramp Builder provides parts to build ramps to use with your Hot Wheels cars.
The fun that kids can have with TRIO sets can be endless if you use your imagination.
When we play with TRIO's we can always thinks of something new and different to make with them.
Yes, grandma likes to play with TRIO'S too!
Since TRIO blocks come in various sizes (with 2-8 connected together) it is rather limiting in what you can build.
I understand the concept is to be like 'big legos', but our kids didn't have as much fun with TRIO as they do with Duplo blocks.
This hybrid between hotwheels and legos did keep them occupied for a while though, and they enjoyed playing with it for a few days.
After that though, they ended up going back to Legos and Melissa and Doug toys and haven't picked them up since.
There is nothing wrong with TRIO, and our kids might just be a bit spoiled having other toys to play with too, but amongst all of the toy choices out there at the toy stores, this probably would not fall into a list of toys we will normally purchase, and we have a ton of Fisher Price products.

This TRIO blocks Hot Wheels stunt ramp builder set is very well-made and is an excellent toy for children of ALL ages (adults included).
The sticks, bricks and panels snap together easily and are so fun to build into many configurations.
The ramp included in this set is easy to put together and the included car has TRIO block wheels that snap on.
This set also comes with a large base for building structures on.
I would highly recommend this set as well as any of the other TRIO block sets - in fact, they are fun to put together and build your very own creations with a combination of sets!
Have fun!
"My son LOVES to play legos, tinker toys and blocks.
He's not much into cars or trains, but this seemed to bridge the gap for him.
Let me just say, I am NOT a builder, and I don't read directions.
Simply by looking at the picture my son and I built the first design in a few minutes.
I was so thankful how easy it fit together and was to build.
So if you're not good like me, have no fear, this is a great toy for your family.
My son has since built several things from his imagination.
I have to say, they do a great job at giving you plenty of pieces to work with.
Some toys just don't give you enough to creatively build.
My only ""complaint"" is that it doesn't hold his attention for hours---maybe about 30 minutes.
So it's great for that, but maybe not as worth the money as a set of legos or blocks.
Then again, my kids is a more creative builder."
"I'm giving this set four stars, but I have mixed reviews from my two boys, ages 6 and 4.
My six year old thought it wasn't all that fun and didn't really enjoy playing with it once it was all put together.
He loved the car that was included and the guy that fit into the car though.
He also liked the blocks themselves, but thought that the ramp system wasnt much fun -- ""it's just taking a car and putting it down the ramp.""
My four year old, however, thought it was SO fun and he loved playing with the car and sending it down the ramp.
So there you go.
Overall, the blocks seem to be built to last, connect well together and the structure is pretty durable once it was assembled."
The TRIO Hot Wheels Stunt Ramp Builder set is super cool.
The TRIO blocks are easy to build with, they just snap together and stick in place.
While this set starts at ages 3 and up, I will say it does take an adult to help build the sets but kids can of course play around with snapping the pieces together.
There are different configurations you can build which make for more fun it gives you lots of options!Once the set was built it stayed up pretty well.
I was able to pick it up and move it around without it coming apart.
Now of course if you don't handle it properly the pieces will come apart, but it just add to the fun by rebuilding it.
It is the perfect size for kids and my boys (3 and 4) really got a kick out of it.
They now want more of the TRIO blocks to play with and I even found that there are other TRIO Hot Wheels sets you can add in.
You do get a green Hot Wheels car that you build with the TRIO blocks but my boys also include their other regular Hot Wheels cars.Overall, this set is great for any Hot Wheels fan.
You get the fun of not only building your stunt sets but then by playing with it.
You get tons of pieces and the instructions show clear pictures of how to build the sets.
My three year old son is very into cars right now and so this seemed right up his ally.
The toy is recommended for 3-7 year olds, but after using it with him, I do not know how well it will hold the attention of the younger.
Yes, you can build it into a few different tracks, however the only thing to do once it is built is send the cars down a short ramp.
This led to a relatively short time of fascination.
Also, I loved the idea of him having to build it which is great for children's motor skills, however it was a little hard for him because you have to match up certain sides of the blocks for it to stick and you also really have to jam the poles into the blocks for them to stay.
This would probably be much better for the 5-7 year old bracket.
At that stage they may even be able to follow the picture directions to assemble and do so more independently.
The Trio Stunt Ramp Builder was a big hit when my 6 year old son first laid eyes on it.
As soon as he saw the box he was excited to rip it open and start building.
I definitely had to help him build the set as the instructions were kind of vague but we had a lot fun building the ramp.
Once built, my son enjoyed sending the car down the ramp to destroy the barrels.
This lasted all of 1-2 hours and then the excitement was gone.
We tried building the ramp in new ways and this was able to squeeze another couple of days of life from the toy but after that all interest was lost.
There simply was not enough flexibility or creativity to keep my son entertained for more than a few hours or days.
*** Positive Points: ***- Concept is very exciting for boys in the 6-8 range.- Pieces were easy for my son to grasp and build though he did need help with the overall construction- The pieces are durable and able to withstand some rough play*** Negative Points: ***- Not a whole lot of play time after the kids have watched the car come down the ramp a few times- Not a whole lot of options to modify the ramp to keep kids entertained'
My boys love to play with cars and love building stuff.
So this was a great toy for them as it combines both.
The Trio brand is Fisher Prices type of Lego building blocks(bigger than Legos) and this time they team up with the Hot wheels brand to make a race car ramp builder.
Trio blocks snap together very easily and can be taken apart easily by kids as well.
they are bigger so they are not lost as easily as well.
This version you can buils a car and a ramp for it to go down.
You can change it up a few different ways when building the ramp but not much.
It also just comes with the one car.
Overall though my boys who are 5, 5, and 4 really loved this and had lots of fun playing with it.
Again only one car but they did a great job of taking turns.
"As other reviewers have mentioned, this unit goes together pretty easily.
My 7 year old had no problems, and actually said it was almost too easy since he's used to building some very large lego creations.
But he enjoys building anything, so this fit the bill for him.He loves crashing.
We have a HUGE geotrax layout and sometimes he'll build it up 6 or 7 levels high just to get a good downhill with a ramp for things to fly off of.
So the concept of a ramp to make things crash is not anything new to him, and I doubt it's anything new to any boy age four or up.
They love crashing toys, whether they're designed to do so or not.
And my son enjoyed this for a while, but soon was looking around for something else to do.He came back to it a few times over the first few days, but for less and less time, and it's already relegated to the ""maybe some day when I don't have anything else to do,"" pile.
I may get one of the additional kits to expand the playing with, and breathe some life back into this, but by itself, while entertaining for a short while, it doesn't stand any test of time in our household."
We already have a good collection of Trios, so this is a nice addition.
My 4 and 5 year olds like using it in tandem with the blocks we already have.
It would still be good without additional blocks, but it's much better with them because it allows more variety.
"I like this toy in that it allows kids to be creative in putting together different patterns in creating their car ramp.
The ramp is also wide enough to fit a range of vehicles that your child may already have, not just the one that they have included-allthough that one is pretty kick-tush.
However, I do have a few complaints.
First, the pieces are kinda hard to fit together.
Granted, they will probably get easier with time rather than the trouble I had with it right out of the box.
But some of them require pretty good hand strength, so you may find yourself having to help younger kids.
Second, if you're actually trying to put together ramp models from the instruction booklet (of which I think there are 3 designs), I would tell you to take the ""instructions"" with a grain of salt as they are inaccurate as pictured.
My biggest complaint is that the ramp needs support on both the front and back sides and that I would prefer that there be some sort of base that can hold it all together.
However, the Fisher-Price designs seem to  imply that you will have the back supported by the base (which is not that big) and then to have a separate structure floating off in space to support the front end of the ramp -- which *always* seems to fall over.
I find that really annoying, especially when having to move the ramp around the room when I'm vacuuming.Honestly, given that I believe that this is an alternative to other creative building toys--Hot Wheels probably would have been better off teaming up with Legos to create a stunt ramp toy package that would have complemented most existing Lego sets.
It's not a bad toy, and my kid and her friends enjoy playing with it, but I think improvements could have been made to the toy design."
We're big Trio fans and big Hot Wheel fans--so were excited to see this set.
It's target age range is 3-8, and I have a 4, just turned 6, and almost 8 year old.
The six year old is the major Hot Wheels fan, so he went to put it together.
He could almost put it all together by himself, but his 8 year old brother had to help in the end.
Still, he got pretty far--I was impressed.
The set comes with three barrels that you can crash into, as well as one car (ours was shiny green) and a guy who goes in the car.
He and his siblings had fun zooming the car down the ramp and crashing into the barrels--but that's pretty much all there is to it.
Which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars.
While with most Trio sets you can build 1000 different things, with this, you basically have what you see- a ramp on a big platform.
There are three slightly different builds, but it's still a ramp on a big platform.
Sure, you can use the Trios to build other things, but not anything that will remotely resemble the Hot Wheels set.
Perhaps more Hot Wheels/Trio set combinations are in the works--which will increase the usability of this one.My big fear is that in a week or so, the directions on how to build the ramp will be gone (although I'm sure they're online)...and these Trios will just be added to our stash.
The car will go in the car bin.
And the orange track?
Who knows.
:)
"The recommended age on the box says 3-8.
We gave these to our boys who are 5 and 7.
Our 5 year old LOVES this set.
It's not SUPER versatile, so he doesn't get too frustrated when he can't get it to do a certain thing - he can recognize that there are only so many pieces that will only fit so many configurations.
With that being said, he does like to put it together, play with it, then take it apart.
It doesn't hold his attention as long as some things with infinite configurations (think Lincoln Logs!
), but he does enjoy it.
Our 7 year old put it together once, in less than 15 minutes, ran the cars down the ramp twice, and walked away.
When his buddies come over, it's a toy they all seem to skip over.
While I am sure there are 7-8 year olds who will enjoy this, I think it will probably be too young for most of them.
I would say 3 is the youngest appropriate age for several reasons: 1.)
LOTS of small blocks to lose, put in the mouth, feed to the dog, etc.
2.)
it DOES take some time and skill to put together, but the biggest reason, for me, is 3.)
it's easy to knock over.
If your kids are playing together, your 5 year old spent a fair amount of time putting it together, and your 3 year old comes barreling into the playroom...
I used this as a gift for my daughter.
She loves building things and playing with cars.
This is the perfect combination.
The other day she got it out and we started playing with it.
We had to 'build' the car, put the driver in it and put together the ramp.
While we didn't put all of it together, we had a fun time doing what we did.I will admit that if your child is under 4 he/she will probably need some help building the ramp correctly.
Other than that it's lots of fun for everyone!
"I tend to buy my son building toys, because he loves building more than playing.
At times, I am fortunate if he lasts playing with his creations, such as when he plays with his Legos.
I am not about to compare Fisher Price's TRIO Hot Wheels collection to any Lego set, but I will say that building and playing with this toy held the same interest to my 4.5 year old as when he builds and plays with Legos.
So far, he has been very pleased with this toy.To begin with, this set includes 93 pieces, which I think is plenty to keep a 3-8 year old preoccupied for some time.
Constructing the toy probably requires (limited) guidance from an adult if the child is about 5 or younger.
The pieces are large and the plastic is quite durable; this toy is certainly not cheaply made.
The blocks snap into place easily but at the same time, taking apart comes too easy.
Depending on the child's age, the toy can take about 1hour or so to build.
My son, with SOME help, built this toy in about 45 minutes.
Once he built it, he could not be drawn away from the toy.
He loves anything with wheels, and this set was not only ideal for including a neat car, but also perfect because the child has a choice of building the given design or building his own, which he loved!
My son also has a vivid imagination; therefore, creating his own race track and grand prix was not too difficult.Although the box claims that the toy is for 3-8 year olds, I am not so sure this toy would hold too much interest for a child over 6.
Perhaps the child (over 6) would enjoy building the set and playing with it for a pair of hours; I only assume this because I find the toy ideal for children between the ages of 3-6 based on my observations with my own son and his older playmates.
However, others might disagree with me.For the price, $40 is not a bad buy for all it includes.
If you are a parent who is unsure if your child will find interest in building blocks, give this collection a try.
In all honesty, MegaBlocks and Lego Duplex blocks are not too different, but on the other hand, this trio set is certainly not a replica of either.
After over 3 months of observing how a 6.5 yr old has been treating this set, it seems like the most fun was derived during the building than actual playing.
Big sis had fun trying to build different ramps to entertain a 15 month old lil bro (not recommended for play for children less than 3 according to the specs).
The pieces seem quite strong and the structures when put together do not tip over or seem unstable.
Overall, very sturdy pieces that are easy to build with.
This is a decent start for evaluating a child's interest in building - before graduating to even more creative sets from Lego (LEGO Ultimate Building Set - 405 Pieces (6166)LEGO Community Miniature Figure Set - Contains 256 Pieces are favorites in this house).
The limitations of this set is that creativity is limited to ramps and very limited structures and there are not many logical complementary sets.
I find that toys like this go a long way in keeping my son very happy.
He loves to build things, which of course this allows you to do.
He also likes watching a car zip down a ramp, which is the main focus of this product.
The pieces (of which there are many) are highly durable and easy to put together and take apart.
This is one of the more involved car ramps I've ever used.
The only real complaint I have is in that there's nothing more tedious than having all the pieces scattered across the house and having to collect them all.
Where some ramps are just a ramp, this one is all parts and pieces and accessories guaranteeing you and your child some pick up time.
"When I asked my 7-year old son what he thought of this toy after months of play, he said, ""Love it!""
He never seems to tire of the car running down the ramp and crashing into ""dynamite barrels"", blocks or anything else he can think of setting up.
But there's much more to this toy!It comes with instructions that he and his 5-year old brother are able to follow and build 4 different configurations.
In all cases, the central theme is the ramp itself, with the main ramp variation being whether there is a curve at the bottom.
My sons had some success trying new variations of the ramp, learning what would work or not.There is even more flexibility with the other TRIO pieces, and there is the option to use other TRIO sets or pieces and combine them to build fancier structures; however, my children have been perfectly content with just using the pieces in this set for many hours of fun!Even the car itself has pieces and can be modified.
Other pieces can interact with the car such as the ramp the car can drive over, or other TRIO pieces that can snap onto the car.This set has survived well for almost a year of use (unlike other similar toys that often last less than a day for my boys).
A few pieces have been lost, but in this set that's not a big deal and there's still plenty to do.Highly recommended!"
This is a great toy for 5-8 y.o.
children.
There are over 90 pieces to put together in different configurations.
The toy is durable and the different colors and piece sizes make it interesting.
Kids will spend many hours having fun with it.
Kids also love it because they can use cars with it, which makes it more interesting than many Lego sets.Because the toy comes with many small pieces, I would not recomend it for children less than 5 years-old or for children who have young siblings.
First, the small pieces can present a choking hazard and second, they are easy to lose.
The ramp builder is as popular with girls as it is with boys.
After all, kids like watching cars go speeding down ramps, especially ones that they built themselves.
"After receiving this toy, the Fisher-Price TRIO Hot Wheels Stunt Ramp Builder, I once again assembled my crack team of testers ... a six year old boy, a four year old girl, and a nearly three year old boy.
But before getting into the actual testing, let me describe what you get:The set includes over 90 pieces including a car, a ""driver"", a sawhorse, three barrels, and a booklet that gives you step-by-step diagrams on how to build four different ramps.
The kit is made of a sturdy plastic, albeit some of the pieces, like the ramps, are intentionally a little flexible.
The building pieces vary from sectioned plastic rectanglar bricks (similar to legos), some straight and curved-lengthed connectors, and some miscellaneous pieces like flags and a roof.
The pieces snap together firmly, and it takes a little force to get them together or take them apart.The testers were all excited to see the toy, especially my six-year old.
He was able to look at the booklet, and after I explained how to use the diagrams, do very well on constructing a ramp.
I still had to help him a little, particularly with the curvy lengths used to connect other pieces ... the connecting ends of the curves bend sharply on one side of the length and not so sharply on the other (as a spacing mechanism), but it was hard for my son to be able to tell which end to use where.
He had enough strength to get all the parts to snap together relatively easily.
My near-three year old could get some, but not all, of the pieces together, but he isn't anywhere ready to be able to build a ramp by himself, of course.
My girl was interested in watching the construction, but not enough to want to build it herself.Once the ramp and car was built, all three enjoyed sending the car down the ramp and into the sawhorse/barrels.
The youngest enjoyed it the most ... he's always liked crashing things into other things.
:-  Both boys have subsequently enjoyed snapping pieces together and free-form building things, although the oldest still likes trying to build ramps from the diagrams.
While I don't think the set will end up being one of my children's favorite toys in the long run, they're enjoying it now.
I'm considering buying one or two different stunt builder sets, both give them something else to build and to provide more pieces for their free-form construction efforts.As an aside, it would be nice if Fisher Price could come up with some bigger, multi-set diagrams (and perhaps post them on their web site for downloading/printing) similar to how some of the marble run sets can be combined into mega marble runs.But this is a decent toy with some learning aspects, mainly in how to construct things from diagrams/building plans.
Four stars."
