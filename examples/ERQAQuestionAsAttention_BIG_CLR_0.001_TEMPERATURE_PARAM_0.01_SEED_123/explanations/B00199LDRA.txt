Reviews:
My two boys are 11 and 12 and they've been looking forward to try this controller.
To be fair and to provide some context, they've been exposed to online and offline racing on a PS3 equipped with steering wheel, brake and gas pedals.The package consists of the controller and one, probably 'random' cartridge that's shaped as a little HotWheels car that can be mounted on top of the controller.
7 more 'cars' are available separately.
There is also a CD that has some software to enable the controller and a game.
Your computer needs a USB port because that's where your controller plugs in.
There is no manual but anyone who can place the CD on the computer's CD tray should be able to install it.
My kids did it by themselves.
Once installed, you can play the game without the CD.
The kids forgot to take the CD out and the game re-installed itself which is harmless but it needs what seemed to be like 15 minutes to complete.The game has 8 tracks and, it seems, each is dominated by certain conditions of elements: fire, ice, water, 'city streets' and so on.
You win points by running the race against the other 8 computer-controlled cars.
The more points you make, the more improvements you can purchase from the Pit Stop such as giving your car the ability to perform certain tricks like flipping and twisting in the air or making it water or fire-resistant.
The goal of the game seems to be to win all 8 races but, I suspect, you will have to buy 7 more little cars before you are allowed to do that because each individual car is well suited for one particular race.
How clever is that?
Once you win all 8 races, the game is over, I suppose.You can also go to HotWheels.com and play some other, more graphically crude games, against other computer-controlled opponents.
My kids almost instantly switched to the keyboard.
Apparently, the keyboard's cursor keys were a lot easier to use and allowed for much more precise control than the controller itself.
"First, this item only works on Windows 2000/XP/Vista with at least 800MHz (1.3GHz recommended) processor and 1 GB of hard drive space.
I am testing this wtih a 3.2GHz processor and 250GB hard drive.
Beware: Mac users cannot use this.The packaging is quite superb--everything is securely wrapped, but is also easily removed with a perforated plastic backing.
No more cut fingers or cursing when trying to cut open some really hard plastic case.You must first install the CD that comes with the ""game.""
While the CD installs quickly, the online update/web activation is EXTREMELY SLOW.
It took over 20 minutes to download the online update--important note, you cannot play the game without downloading the update.In addition to the CD, you have a car-holding handgrip, which allows the user to play the game.
It is akin to the original Sega or Nintendo controllers with a directional pad on the left and two buttons on the right.
The packaging says the game is for 3+ year olds, but the game insert says it's for 5+ year olds.
My 3.5 year old's hands cannot hold the controller, but it does fit comfortably in mine (I'm 6 ft tall with appropriate sized hands).The game itself has a pretty good sound to it, and the graphics are equivalent to perhaps an old school Sega.
It's probably catchy for a younger user (definitely corny to an old guy like me).
The load screen transfers are also EXTREMELY SLOW, taking more than 15 seconds to transfer from selection screen to selection screen.
Beware if you choose to go to the wrong screen--it takes forever to get back where you wanted to go.For those of you old timers, it's much like an updated version of Atari's Grand Prix.
A nice touch for the younger ones is that you cannot fall off the race course unless you go into a trap, so if you don't have good hand-eye coordination, you'll still stay on the track.The two buttons don't have any instruction, but green is for go, and red is for go backwards.
It works to slow down and eventually stop if you time it right, but if you just hold the red button down, you eventually go backwards--it's kind of fun to run a track backwards.Another nifty idea is the car-tridge.
This hotwheels car is pretty neat--just like a regular hotwheels car, but with a plastic peg plate that inserts into the controller.
Depending on which car-tridge you have, your onscreen avatar car changes--hence mattel's rationale to sell multiple versions of this game.
Here is another great option for your K-3rd grader.
And, the price is right for what Amazon is asking.
However, I wouldn't pay the higher price as some individual sellers have it marked.The ability to change Car-Tridges adds a bit of extra fun and realism to the game.
My children have fun exchanging their race cars and putting them to the test and into action on the screen.The controller is great for traveling as it is small enough to be easily thrown into your laptop's case when traveling.It is also a nice option for classroom application.
I teach 2nd grade and am always on the lookout for ways to reward good work/behavior.
I have added the HotWheels Turbo Driver to my bag of incentives for the students.
You would be amazed at how much hard work and good behavior you can get out of a child when there is 10 minutes of play time on the HotWheels Turbo Driver hanging in the balance.
"Easy plug and play device that lets you race Hot Wheels cars on the computer.
You can change the car to use on different race tracks.
It is very easy to set up and gives ""computer time"" to your racing fan without worrying about what they might come across on the internet.The different tracks are alot of fun and we liked the ability to change to car so that there are many options and keeps the game from getting boring.I definitely recommend!"
The hot wheels turbo driver is is a fun game and is a good option for kids who do not have an expensive gaming system.
I think any kid would enjoy it.
Who doesnt love a good racing game?I found it pretty easy to install despite the lack of clear instructions.
You just plug the controller into your computer's USB port.
While I was intimidated at first, the controllers were intuitive and easy to use once I got started.
In terms of packaging, I appreciated the perforated backing which made it very easy to open.
That is a big deal in my house, and the fact that you dont need scissors is much safer and easier.I liked the graphics and the different backgrounds well done, and pretty convincing in 3D.
However, with all the advanced driving games out there, it may face some stiff competetion.
With one car rather than the whole set, I felt a little bit like I was using a demo.
However, I would seriously consider getting another car or two and going further with the game.
Good ideal for a toy and video game integration.
Pretty easy setup, but lacks longevity.
It was fun in the beginning, but got bored after 15 minutes.
Maybe it's because I'm not the target marget age.
I ordered the Hotwheels.com Turbo Driver.
It came with very little instructions but after installing the included disc, it directs you to the internet.
It states that after downloading a file, you can use by itself or online at hotwheels.com.After 1 hour of downloading at dial-up speed, I had only downloaded 6% so I called the Mattel consumer relations, they did indeed confirm that broadband is required.
Since I only have dial-up, I cannot use the product.I also wanted to note that the one page instruction sheet states that they reserve the right to terminate turbo driver online service after January 1, 2010 so before you invest alot of money and buy all the different car-tridges, you may want to know that after January 2010, you may not be able to use them online.
"For the price, this is not worth it.
The whole idea of ""car-tridges"" sound nice and all, but it is a novelty idea.
You only get 1 car with this package, and you have to purchase cars separately if you want to race with a different car.
Sounds neat right?
well...that costs more $$$, and kids WILL want more cars.My nephew who is a under 5 enjoyed it, but I know he will outgrow it quick because every time I play on the PS3, that's what he wants to play.The package says Hotwheels has the right to discontinue the online play after 2010, so who knows what will happen to the online play then.Save the money and buy a used console game system for your child, and plug it into the tv.
They will enjoy that more."
I have to admit it was kind of rocky getting started.
It took a long time to download to my computer and the controls were hard to get used to...but after all that...this game is really alot of fun!
It comes with a real turbo hot wheels car that the handheld console recognizes when you attach it.
The car you attach is the car you will be driving.
(I guess you can buy the other cars separately.)
You race in one of 8 different racing games which you have to unlock.
Everytime you finish your race you get points that you accumulate to buy special features for the car.
The added bonus is that you can go to the hotwheels website and play over 20 mini games also!
Overall this was a big hit for my boys!
"This game was just ok for me.
The bad parts about it were that it did take awhile for the disk to install, there were no instructions about how to control the car (it's pretty easy to figure out, but it would just be nice to have some instructions on it) and I didn't think the graphics were that good.
Also, the little ""CARtridge"" fell out a couple times on me.
As for the game itself, it's a standard racing game, if you have a game system that you currently use, you can probably get a better racing game on it then this is.
If you're looking for a cheap racing game that you can play almost as soon as you get it, this might be your best bet.
I know that different ""CARtridges"" give you different advantages, but I'm not sure what the difference is, I pretty much suck at all racing games, so I'm not too worried about the actual winning of the race at this point!"
"The instructions with this are pretty nonexistant.
I spent 15 minutes on the online site wondering why I couldn't get it to work when I realized that I should be using the CD instead.
I tried out the game, and found it adequate for small children.
The control is easy to operate, and makes logical sense.
It allows the ""down"" of the stick to be backward, which is not usually available, and could be useful for small children who are less able to maneuver.
The box suggests 5 years of age, and that's probably about accurate.If the child is older or has a game console, I think they would end up being bored pretty fast."
This is a fun toy.
First I won't and can't compare it to more advance game systems it couldnt stand up to that.
However, for what you pay you get access to many deferrent games with Hotwheels.com and you can purchase additional cars (carthridges).
The graphics are decent enough.
It's seems pretty durable like one of those toys you can plug in many years later and expect it to work.
My son likes it and he's into more advance games, but he still gets some fun out of this one as does his friends.
Ages 5-8 should like this allot.
First I have to say the online games suck!
We dont like them.
We tried it and my son asked to put the cd back in.
They said on the package that the online portion with be discotinued without notice on or after Jan. 2010.
Oh well.Now for the acual game and controller.
The cd it comes with is very easy to install.
Just pop it in.
It takes a while for it to download at first.
Once that is done, you are ready to play.
You can race on all 8 levels.
Each level has special track that only a certain car can go on.
It's a way to get you to buy the extra cars.The extra cartriges are $20 a peice.
I know we are getting one for sure.
They are really pricey though.My almost 6  year old, really loves this game, and so do I.
We do like video games and the controller is similar to the xbox 360 joysticks.
There is no delay or anything with it.
my son gave this as his secret santa gift at school but his friend loved this toy.
it was easy to connect and get started to play.
the cartridges are hard to find in stores.
that may or may not be a local problem.
you can find them online with no problem.
the races are fun, easy enough for a kid.
fun concept.
This is a great idea....but there are some serious problems.
First, and probably most annoying is that it resets my display to 800x600....okay, that's not as annoying as getting a blue screen after exiting the game, which is even more annoying.
I have uninstalled the software and will try it on another computer, but since I have a great graphics card on my laptop, and have never had a problem running ANY game (I have a Dell Inspiron 9300 with an upgraded graphics card).
I have megs of ram and plenty of HD space.
The gaming experience itself is relatively weak.
Keep in mind that for the cost of this item, you can get a very good racing game with better control, etc..
The difference is this is a bit novel, but I don't think it warrants anything special.
The controller is pretty weak, as is the racing.
The sense of speed is also weak.
My 4.5 year old liked it for a few minutes and then got bored.
He outlasted me.
I really wanted to like this, especially since my son loves hotwheels anything, but this certainly did not live up to my expectations, and I think you will find your money better spent on something else.
I think for it to be better, the controller should be better, tighter, and the software need much more variety and should be more expansive.
Like I said, I wanted to love it, but there are so many better Hotwheels products.
The HotWheels.Com Turbo Driver Controller turns every personal computer into an arcade game and should be on every child's Christmas or birthday list!
The box says it's recommended for kids 5+, but it's entertaining for kids all ages.Installs in two easy steps:1.
Plug into the USB port on your PC2.
Allow the accompanying disc to download the softwareThere are various cartridges (aka cars) that can be used with the Turbo Driver Controller.
The game comes with one and additional cars/vehicles can be purchased separately.The graphics are pretty cool, too.
There are 8 backgrounds, driving tracks and conditions to choose from.
Depending on which cartridge (car) you navigate, your experience will be different.
Try various cartridges because they all navigate the tracks differently.This is a great option for kids ages 5+ and for anyone who enjoys racing and owns a computer!
"Pros: 1)NO BATTERIES NEEDED!
It gets its power from the computer's USB port you plug it into.2)EASY to figure out.
No need to be able to read to understand game.3)Pretty much keeps the car on the track to minimize frustration for young players.
No need to worry about running out of gas, or ""lives.
""4) Can use earned points to upgrade for more car features- such as 25 different car horn sounds, designs for car, power, etc.5) Can buy other cars that will work with it.6) Can pop car out of controller and play with it like a regular toy.7)Ergonomic design of controller makes it comfortable and easy to hold.8) several different track designs to choose from.Cons; A) Requires specialized Hot Wheels car that snaps into controller.
One comes with the game unit.B) Car engine sound effects are a bit strange; sounds more like a drill than a race car.
Only tried one type of car, others may be different.C) Have to go through ""install"" window to run game each time.
Don't have to do full install, but it is confusing.D)Too easy to oversteer, but no different from other race games.E) Once you have begun a race, it's not apparent how to stop in the middle of it to do something else/try a new track.
Figured out you have to press the Escape key.Other cons which may be due to our ancient laptop (it's 6+ years old);C)Could not control sound volume while playing the game.D)Took about 15 minutes to install.
Again, this may be due to our old computer processor.Game controller with 3 buttons is very easy to figure out, even for middle-aged parents like me who don't typically play these kinds of games.
Of course, my 5-year-old had no trouble figuring it out on his own.
I'm  guessing this would be easy enough for a child younger than 5, but safety reasons suggest it is for ages 5 and up.
3-D Graphics are good, controller is very responsive.
Even our dinosaur laptop didn't have any problem handling the colors, speed or graphics.Will this be a ""must have"" toy this Christmas?
I think it would be a nice birthday gift, as I think a lot of kids ages 5 to 9 will enjoy it.
If your child already likes to play with cars, they will like this game, but if your child is in the ""tweens"" or older, it may be too easy for them."
This is great for young entry level gamers who don't already have one of the big game console players.
I was pleasantly surprised by the graphics (high quality and well detailed) and by the friendly maneuverability of the car.
The system allows for a moderate lack of precision by driver.
Wipe-outs are fairly quick to self correct to get back to driving.
My boys are aged 7 and 8 and have had the Game Cube, Gameboy, and Ninetendo DS for years.
They did enjoy playing this despite the other competion in their playroom.
They thought it was cool to have 8 different courses to choose from (Grand Prix, Islands, Streets, Arctic, Jungle, Volcano, Desert, and The Sky).
There is also 20 games online available to play (which in fine print, Hot Wheels reserves the right to discontinue after 01//1/2010).
If your kid is crazy about Hot Wheels cars, you can buy extra cars to race on the gaming unit.
The plus in buying the other cars is that each car runs best on it's particular home course and the home car is the only one which will enable the driver to use the special tricks (i.e.
going thru/under water or fire...) and short cuts built into the course.
Other pluses are this unit takes no batteries and the packaging was very easy to open with it's tear perforations.
This unit does require having a computer to run it-it is NOT a TV plug-in-play game.
My son still loves cars and racing games.
Put the two together and for sure I thought I had a winner here.
I was wrong.
The game came with no instructions.
Installation took forever.
Overall, the game was boring and sits collecting dust after using it once.
"We LOVE this game.
My husband is obsessed and he loves his XBOX 360.
He sat there playing this thing for over 4 hours until he could no longer keep his eyes open.
It is very fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it as well.
It is very reminiscent of that ""Cruisin"" game that we used to play in the movie theaters or arcades growing up.The controller is pretty big and fits nice in an adults palms as it does in a childs.
The control is nice and tight and you get to buy some cute upgrades as you play more and more races.
There is an easy connection via USB with a very quick install and the configure screen takes about 2-3 minutes.
The graphics are really nice, not 360 or PS3 nice but on par with the ""Cruisin"" game that I previously referred to.
There is no lag and it responded well to my Vista system.The CARtridge pops up with the push of the red eject button and you can easily swap it for other CARtridges with different attributes.
These can become rather costly.
One thing that turned me off is that fact that on the packaging is says that without notice they might discontinue the online fuction on Jan 2010.
That isn't right when children are involved.The second thing that we didn't like at all was the online service.
The games were horrible and the graphics were atrocious.
So maybe it isn't so important to have the online games after all.
For us, it was horrible.
The game is fun and there are many different enviroments to race in.I highly recommend this for children aged 7 and up.
