It is not easy to fix.
Solid 3 stars rating for this toy.
When I first opened it, it took two adults looking through the pictures to finally figure out how to make it work.
Added to the helmet already in his position, and he was one happy boy.
Pretty disappointing.

Reviews:
My sons were really excited about getting to test out this shield!
Cap is our favorite superhero and we have a costume for each boy.Here are the pros and cons of the shield:Pros1.
Very sturdy plastic construction2.
Only one step of assembly (putting the trigger on the bottom of the shield)3.
Shoots a really good distance4.
Foam &#34;missiles&#34; are soft and shouldn't cause damage (of course, use common sense when playing)5.
Trigger not only fires missiles but closes the missile assemblyCons1.
The trigger was hard to push into place.
It fell out twice when my youngest was playing before we were really able to get it in place.2.
The missiles get stuck a lot in the firing assembly.3.
The trigger is hard to squeeze for smaller hands (I'm hoping it will loosen up as we play more).4.
The strap on the bottom is hard to attach by yourself, especially for smaller hands.All in all, we're thrilled with the shield and have already planned epic battles in the back yard.
This is a very fun product, and my daughter - who claims to have a crush on Capt.
America - absolutely loves playing with it.
The claim to shoot darts &#34;up to 20 feet away&#34; is probably more accurate on the &#34;up to&#34; part than on the &#34;20 feet&#34; part.
Generally, the darts are doing well to fly across the living room.
I suppose they might go 20 feet if the person is shooting downhill, but I haven't seen them go farther than about 10 feet.The biggest problem, though, is that the dart firing mechanism started breaking within a couple days of playing with this.
Darts will always slip out of place in one of the barrels, and then they won't fire.
When she pulls the trigger to retract the firing mechanism, then the unfired dart gets jammed between the shield and the barrel, and we have to fuss with it to make it shut.
I could understand if this kind of malfunction happened after months of solid play, but within only a couple days??
?I give this 3 stars because it is a fun toy (if annoyingly difficult to put together), and my daughter loved running around pretending to be Capt.
America.
The fun factor is pretty high.
Now, though, with it malfunctioning all the time, this toy just sits in a corner.
My son is a huge fan of anything superhero-related, so this shield straight out of the box was a big hit.
Even without the dart-launching capabilities, it's a neat shield.
Added to the helmet already in his position, and he was one happy boy.
As for the darts, we did have some trouble launching them.
I didn't expect them to fly straight or have much in the way of aiming accuracy, so that was fine, but my 7-year old has trouble pulling the mechanism.
I don't know if ours is just extra tight, but for a toy rated five years and over, I think the firing mechanism should be a bit easier to pull.
The darts do go quite far - we've had up to 15 feet.
We have had a few misfires.I think if your child loves superheros, this toy will be a hit.
If you're getting it just for the launching capability, I might suggest going with a regular Nerf item.
This is a cool toy, but unfortunately, within a couple of days the first dart doesn't shoot at all, and the second shoots but does it a bit too early.
No one likes that.You can't reload and re-shoot before the darts go back down into the shield.
Basically, the 5th time you shoot, the darts retract into the shield.
There's a small door which flips up to let you reload them while the barrels are hidden in the shield.There's no storage for extra darts.
The shoot a decent distance, but not nearly as far as a normal gun.
This is a super addition to any little action hero's armament.
It is a colorful Captain America Shield with the added bonus that it shoots four nerf bullets.
It has added features that gives it the cool super hero feel.
The bullets shoot from four &#34;guns&#34; that hide in the shield and pop up when the blue handle is pulled.
They then shoot one at a time, as the red button is pushed.
On the fifth consecutive time the button is squeezed, the guns snap back into the shield and are hidden.
The blue handle pops them out again.
This is a cool feature; although, it is also a criticism, because no matter what, on the fifth squeeze of the trigger the guns snap back into the shield.This shield should last through the Captain America phase and bring loads of fun.
I recommend the helmet, too.
I received this item for my 6 year old son.
He loves all super heroes, so this seemed like a good toy for him.
When I first opened it, it took two adults looking through the pictures to finally figure out how to make it work.
Everything seemed backwards.
The darts pop out of the shield facing the child, but with some work, the whole dart unit turns around.
Not sure why it was designed like this, but it was.
It seems like a lot of moving parts to break down the road.
At that point, one pull is supposed to release one dart.
In ours, that happened sometimes.
Other times, more than one dart released.
Not a big deal.As far as long term play, he played with it for about 10 minutes and then got bored with shooting four darts, picking them up, and reloading.
It is now thrown in his bedroom floor and hasn&#8217;t been touched since the first day.My biggest issue with the toy is the turning dart mechanism though.
If a child really loved this toy and played with it a lot, I foresee that being something that will be broken very quickly.
This shield is a lot of fun and really cool.
It has an adjustable strap underneath to adjust to different size arms.However, it is a little harder for a young child (6years old) to squeeze the trigger.
I imagine even harder for a younger child.
I can be done, but a little more effort is needed.
It is also hard for a child to understand that you have to squeeze the trigger four times and then a fifth to close the dart shooter.The shield mechanism easily jams if you try to close it by pushing it closed and not using the trigger.
It is not easy to fix.
I had to remove the trigger and keep playing with it.If you put the darts back in before the fifth trigger they can be stored in the shield however, I see them easily getting lost.I do like that these are soft darts and not the hard plastic darts in the helmet.
To be fair, I should say that my son would be happy with this product if it was simply just a plain shield with nothing to shoot.
But, since this product does have missiles to launch, I have to give it a three just based on the fact that it was too hard for my five year old to both hold the shield and shoot (you have to hit just right).
Ultimately, he just needs a lot of help with it, so we tend to just play without the shooting aspect.
This was given to a four year old on the verge of five and he was thrilled to receive it.
The excitement waned as the frustration with the blaster elements mounted.
The trigger can be hard for little hands to grip and manipulate.
The blasting mechanism gets stuck and there is no way to control it well when it is working without going through the five trigger pulls to get it collapse and open again.
My frustration mounted as he asked for help over and over again.
We give toys to have a moment's peace and childhood fun, not create more trauma and frustration all around.
That said, as a shield, he loved it.
The concept was strong, but there is too much work for not so smooth and long lasting action.
As a nerf type blaster, it was a bust.
If it weren't a Captain America toy it would probably already be in the giveaway pile, but it'll keep for a while.
I picked up the Captain America Stealthfire Shield and the Captain America Battle Helmet (both part of the Captain America Super Soldier Gear set) for my son (almost 5 years old) since he likes to dress up as various comic book superheroes.The Stealthfire Shield is a pretty neat play shield and my son absolutely loves it, but it has a few design flaws that make it frustrating for my son and for me.First, let's talk about the good: The shield has a good size that isn't too big for a little kid but also isn't too small.
The shield surface is made of a more flexible plastic than the handle or missile launcher mechanism so the shield will flex instead of breaking when a kid plays rough.
The cool thing about this shield is that you can pull a handle behind the shield and four missile launchers pop out that shoot Nerf bullets that are essentially the same as the Nerf ammo used in several other Nerf guns.
I like the fact it uses soft Nerf ammo so my son doesn't hurt his sister when he shoots her and I don't hurt my feet when I step on the ammo early in the morning when I'm walking around my house.The biggest complaint I have with the Stealthfire shield is the way the missile launcher pops out of the shield.
The four barrels swing out from a backward position and move forward to the firing position when you pull the charging handle.
After your kid shoots all the ammo and pulls the trigger one more time the barrels swing back and the launcher closes so you can reload.
The problem is that about 10-30 percent of the time the barrels get stuck during the because they have to swing out and swing back.Whoever designed this shield should have realized it was a bad idea to have this many moving parts on a kids toy ... particularly when they could have designed the missile launcher to be contained within the shield without having the barrels swing around and risk getting jammed up.The bottom line is that my son really likes this shield (except for when the missile barrels get jammed) but I think this shield should have been designed better in the first place so the jams wouldn't happen.
This is a fun toy for my son as he likes it but it does not always shoot or shut properly.
It is heavy and clunky and with it only working part of the time not worth the hassle in the long run.
He like that is shoots the nerf like bullets, but it only shoots four and they have to be in just right.
It is really annoying for me as I usually have to help him with the toy and the bullets shoot out in seconds.
They also shot from two sides not straight out.
Like the battle helmet, this shield has a solid feel and is made of hard plastic.
You don't want to throw it like a frisbee as you can with other basic Captain America shields.
However, also like the battle helmet, it is also a little unwieldy, especially the mechanism to open and fire the rocket launcher.It takes two hands to operate--one hand to hold the shield and pull the trigger and the other to pull the handle to open the launcher mechanism.
There is no easy way to return the rocket launcher into the shield--you have to force it or bang on it each time whether you have fired all four of the missiles or not.
The mechanism will not open or close if the missiles are not firmly fitted all the way on the launcher.
My boy likes it, but it is a little troublesome to operate.
My kids (7, 6, 4, 2, and 10 months) were super excited about this toy.
As I waged war against the packaging, they stood ready to pounce on it as soon as it was freed.
It took so long, a few of them wandered off before freedom was actually achieved.
It was far too complicated for the 2 year old to understand.
He simply kept the shield closed and yelled &#34;Bam!&#34; That was the happiest any of them have been with this toy.
Once the 4 and 6 year olds could get their hands on it and pull one end to open the gun then squeeze the other end to fire the gun, the fun ended and the screaming and &#34;I hate this toy!&#34; began.
First, it takes almost adult strength and dexterity to pull the thing open.
The yankings of a 4 and 6 year old quickly broke the mechanism that flips the gun part around toward the front.
It is also ridiculously difficult, even for me, to get those guns back down into the shield.
They darts are under Nerf quality.
Though they are Nerf style and size, so easily replaceable.
But the gun only worked for a few days before it bit the dust.
Now, it is just a shield.
Save yourself the trouble and just get a shield without the gun to begin with.
The design is awful.
It just isn't built to withstand any amount of kid use.
the shield worked...looked awesome...kind of small but perfect for a small child like age 4 or 5. my son launched the darts and one broke right away and the others were lost.
he still uses the shield for pretend play but lost interest pretty quickly
This product did not work properly out of the box and it develops mechanical problems every now and then.
However, it is very cool the way the firing mechanism stays hidden until you pull the handle, and then after the fourth shot, the fifth trigger-pull sends everything back into the loading position, hidden behind the shield.
While I don't expect this thing to last forever, little Captain America fans are going to go nuts over it, and geeky parents are going to find themselves toying with the mechanism as well.
If you find your shield is not working, cycle through the steps a bunch of times, making sure to pull the handle slowly.
This has always solved our problems.
You may want to avoid this product if you expect this rather complex mechanism to work all the time, perfectly.Other notes: The size of the shield is small.
Little kids (perhaps 6 or younger) may have some trouble pulling the trigger.
The packaging is the infuriating kind that parents curse.
My son says there should be some padding between his arm and the back of the shield (where there is only hard plastic).
Slightly based on the shield used by Captain America in 'The Winter Soldier', the stealthfire shield should provide kids and fans of the movie with hours of fun.
When I say 'slightly based' of course I mean that the shield in the movie does not fire missiles, but that's a complain from an adult, truth is, my kid did not care and had a blast playing with this.Assembly of the handle is required and I recommend reading the instructions included, my son was struggling to close the hidden launcher and it was a matter of pushing the handle (probably not an obvious thing to do for some) The so-called missiles are in fact darts made of foam, so there is no risk of accidentally hitting someone of breaking something should they hit it.No batteries are required and the 4 darts to be used are included in the box, it would have been great if some spare darts had been included in my opinion.
Something we may need to look into is that, according to the box, other products sold separately can be attached to the shield.
With only four darts used at a time, it may be something worth looking into.Definitely recommended for young fans of the film and the character.
My son and a nephew had a great time playing  with it.
After I freed this shooting shield from it's cardboard and wire prison, I looked over the instructions and handed it to my six year old.
Before he could even fire a shot, the dart holders had come out of alignment and I have been unable to get them back to their proper position.
Now the star in the middle of the shield is stuck in the 'up' position and won't shoot.
Pretty disappointing.
This is a great toy for my 5 year old nephew who loves to dress up as Captain America!
The shield shoots out 4 Nerf darts.
They aren't easy to reload for a child, but he got the hang of it.
There is an adjustable arm strap to fit the shield on any arm.
And the 5th squeeze (which launches the darts) will collapse the &#34;guns&#34; back into the shield if the darts are not reloaded.
Clever design and a great toy for super hero fans!
We got this shield and the battle helmet for our five year old sons.
The shield is great, and while the shooting action wasn't intuitive for them at first, it didn't take long for them to learn.
My husband even got in on the action!
I bet we will lose some or all of the suction darts, but the boys will use their imagination to keep up the fun after that.
My grandson loves Captain America and he loves to dress as him.
He likes putting his Captain America helmet on and using his shield.
The only trouble with it is the darts.
They seem to jam up and can frustrate him somewhat.
Still it doesn't interfere with his fun of being Captain America.
My six-year-old had the original disc-shooting Captain America shield from around the time the first movie came out and had put this one on his wish list, so when it popped up on Vine, he was very excited to try it.Unfortunately, despite the appeal of shooting Nerf-like projectiles--something no six-year-old can resist--he found this more clunky the original model, which works as a shield, even when the discs are all expended.Instead, this one was a little bit difficult to load, and with only four shots you do that often, but even more so hard to shoot.
The pull back trigger is awkward and hard for him to even do at all, let alone seamlessly during play.
And, because of the way it's built as a shooter, it doesn't have a good handle on the back to use as a pure shield, either.
Don't get me wrong, it can be done, but it's more awkward than it should be.All in all, as a mom, I'd give this three stars at most, but even with the difficulties he experienced, my son wanted to rate it five because it's &#34;so cool,&#34; so I'm splitting the difference and giving this one four stars.
This item pairs up nicely with the Captain America Marvel Super Soldier Gear Battle Helmet and is fun (or should be fun for a youngster to use) but the nerf darts that are used in it may tend to jam up and leave the little persons that are trying to play with the toy a bit frustrated.
Assuming a bit more maturity on the part of the youngster that is playing with, getting the darts to fire again shouldn't be too tough though it would slow down play time a bit.Relatively reasonably priced and the playability and fun factors should be fairly high for young fans of Captain America.
Solid 3 stars rating for this toy.
This is NOW a really neat toy that works great during our Nerf wars.
It did take a bit of tweaking to get it to work initially, but once we got everything all lined up correctly it has worked great ever since.
Lots of our Nerf bullets also work.
