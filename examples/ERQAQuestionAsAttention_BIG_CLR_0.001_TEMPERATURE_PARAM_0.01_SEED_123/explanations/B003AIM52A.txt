Reviews:
"I don't know exactly what the recommended age is for this game because the picture on the product page says 6+, the product description says 8+ and the box we received through Vine says 7+.
The cards in our game also have a solid white background and only English titles, unlike the Amazon pictures.
The actual ""hedbanz"" work pretty well.
They adjust easily and hold the cards in place.
One issue though is that all the parts are loose in the box.
The cards will end up in a jumble each time you put it away.The biggest problem I had though was the ambiguous instructions, which explicitly state that ""you can ask any question except `who am I?'""
This seems pretty clear, but all of the ""sample questions"" are yes/no.
Did the makers intend to limit the question type?
Shouldn't this be in the rules?I tried out the game with my kids (ages 4 and 7) and they had a little fun with it for about a half hour a week ago.
They haven't wanted to get in out again even when I suggested it.
This is not a bad game, but we have better ones."
When my son asked for this game for Christmas I wondered how fun it could actually be.
I also figured it would be extremely easy and like with many other new games, get boring quickly.
I was wrong.
The game comes with a stack of cards, some points chips and headbands that you place the cards in and on your head.
You don't look at the card you select, but everyone else does.
While the card it on your head for everyone else to see, you try and ask questions to guess what you are.
Each player also has a card on their head, and everyone takes turns guessing.While all the objects you are trying to guess are very simple and designed so that even young kids can play, it's still extremely challenging.
It can easily take a half hour just to finally figure out that you are a pencil, or a horse, or a cake.
Once you guess correctly, then you place one of your chips back in the pile.
If you give up, you have to take a new card and an additional playing chip.
Whoever gets rid of all their chips first wins.
The more people playing, the more fun it can be.
But you can easily play this with just two people as well.
And here I thought this game would be dull and not well suited for adults, but I was wrong.
Everyone of all ages will have fun, and it makes a great family night activity!
'Hedbanz' is not an original game in its concept, in fact it's something that has been played for a long time.
It's been made famous recently being played in Quentin Tarantino's 'Inglourious Bastards,' in fact.
What makes this the most fun is the compatibility for all members of the family.
Parents & children can have fun with it without issue in the slightest.
It's easy to learn and doesn't contain overly complicated rules to alienate anyone.For non-family atmospheres, it actually can work as a drinking game as well.
Just a suggestion.
I sort of can't believe that this is an actual game in a box.
My family has been playing this game for decades -- we call it 'Tapehead' (we tape the handwritten cards to our head).
Tapehead is an excellent game.This is a bit of a dumbed down version.
It gives you the headband, it gives you the cards, it gives you sample questions, etc.
I brought it to my family for Christmas and the consensus at the end of the week was that it was a bit too elemental and limiting (not very many cards) for teens and up to enjoy for long, but the 10 and under set really loved it and appreciated the ease of not having to come up with a word themselves.I saw people questioning the timer/rules.
FWIW, we disregarded the timer completely and just used 'Tapehead' rules:  When it's your turn you keep asking questions until you get a 'no'.
Once you get a 'no' answer the next player gets to ask questions.
Winner is first to guess their card but we play til everyone has guessed their card.BOTTOM LINE:  Definitely fun, but after a few days anyone over 12 may prefer to make their own cards up.
This is a hit with the elementary-school aged kids though.
"It is hard to find a game that my entire family can sit down with and enjoy.
Either game is aimed at the younger members or our family, or it is better for the older members.
Usually the grown ups have to give in to the kids.
But now we have Hedbanz and we all have a great time playing it.The rules are simple: ask questions of the other players until you guess ""what you are"".
Older players will tend to ask better questions, but younger players will have much sillier questions and answers that can really throw the adults off track!Of course, it is hard not to be silly when you have a card strapped to your forehead by a bright blue plastic band.
We all had a blast!
Sometimes it pays to be only 7 ask simple questions that lead you right to the answer.
At other times, an adult can get themselves way off track.
It was a ton of fun and this is our new game night favorite.We do have one complaint though: it only comes with 75 cards.
You'll probably only go through 20 or so cards in a 4 person game, but this still means that you will start seeing the same cards after your 3rd game.
No such a big problem for kids, but if you have 2 adults playing the games could start to get repetitive after a while.Overall, I highly recommend this game for a family or group with a broad age range.
Everyone will have fun and can play at their own skill level."
Okay, I saw a game similar to this on icarly one day which is why it was appealing to me first off.
It is cute if your kids play it right.
Problem with us is my 4 year old wants to play and she tells everyone what they have on their hedbandz!
Besides that the game is really fun because the kids learn deductive reasoning when trying to figure out what is one their own head.
Most of the cards are relatively easy things (like spaghetti or a ladder) so its things that most kids could figure out (unless your 4 year old sister is hanging around).
The directions are easy to understand and of course I guess you don't have to play with the hourglass timer...especially if you are playing with a younger crowd!
Fun all around especially when playing with your kids.
This is one of those family or party games during which you'll find your self laughing a lot.
It's not wonder Ellen DeGeneres plays a variation of it on her daytime show occasionally.
You can play it by attaching a card to your forehead with the supplied headbands and trying to guess what you are by the questions the other players give you.What you discover is that you cannot simply follow the same lines of questioning every time because the wrong kind of question can derail you into the wrong direction.
It's not as easy as it seems yet everyone is capable of doing rather well.My kids found the charades variation even more fun and somewhat easier to play.
Either way, it's a low cost investment in hours of family fun.
They may need to print some new cards soon, though.
Last night I sat down with my kids for an hour and we played this game.
It was so fun!
The only drawback for me was that I wish that it came with 300+ item cards.
It seems like we'll start repeating cards very shortly!
The head bands are durable and they fit around all the different head sizes in my family.
The game is very simple but I think that's why I like it so much.
Recommended!
"I got this game for something we could all play, and it was absolutely true.
It's similar to idiot poker, where you put the card on your head and everyone can see but you.
My 8 year old LOVED this game.
It helped her learn to reframe things into categories.
""Am I an animal?
""Am I a person?""
""Am I a food?""
We all have enjoyed playing, although we don't stick to the rules.
We just all answer the person asking the questions, instead of going around and asking each person.
And we keep asking until we get it instead of watching the timer.The timer tends to run out kind of fast.
Supposedly you can get as many cards as you can in the time, but none of us have ever solved 2.
Practice makes perfect?
We're not here for the competition anyway, so we stopped using it.
My first card, for example, I couldn't get for a long time and it took two rounds.The headbands are reasonably comfortable and sturdy.
They hold the card well.
As a side note, we played in the evening near a window and you could see it in the reflection.
This is a nice little question and answer game for the whole family.
It comes with a handy Timer Glass and is easy to use and understand for all members of the family.
2 to 6 players can enjoy it.
It's a simple game, but can hold everyone's attention to the end.
It sells for around $ 15 and is worth it.
Everyone will enjoy playing !
!
I seen the commercials for this game so when my sister recently asked me to buy it for her I did.
Its one of those games we all enjoy, my 5 year, 11 year, my 18 year old sister and her 21 year old boyfriend, myself (31 year old mom) even my 55 year old dad.
We all have a blast trying to figure out what the heck we are!
And it is so hilarious watching the others trying to guess whats on their head!
Especially when we give them such obvious clues and they still can't get it!
Such a funny game, it keeps us up late many nights just laughing 'til our sides hurt!
Highly recommended to everyone!
The only thing I suggest is to make sure you're in a room with no mean of cheating, you wouldn't think such a thing but in these days, there's always a mirror or cell or tv screen of some sort and someone looks at themselves somehow!
We found that out quick enough!
Also I wish they'd make cards you could buy as an add on, until then we make out own, and sometimes an adult version for when the kids are asleep!
:)
"Headbanz is a fun guessing game that is really nothing new.
You may have done this with index cards stuck to your forehead or with Post-It notes.
What Headbanz brings to the table is a sturdy, adjustable plastic headband to hold your playing cards in.
The graphics on the cards are colorful and the kids really liked the game.
We played the ""correct"" yes/no version of the game, but if someone went three rounds without guessing what they were, we started to help a little.
For example, one of the kids was ""Milk"" and after a few rounds of establishing they could be eaten and they were liquid, he asked, ""am I orange"".
Rather than prolong things, we said ""no, but you're white"" to help move things along.
If you are playing with young kids, hints like this can be helpful.The timer and the scoring chips are a neat addition to make this play like an actual game where you are competing against others rather than just a guessing game."
This has been a fun and welcomed addition to our family game night it provides plenty of laughs...i'st easy for the kids to follow along.
The headbands are comfortbale and seems well constructed I expect this game will be providing laughs for years, which makes me wish they would have provided more cards.
All in all, fun game ;o)
When I initially saw this game I thought of the Ellen show when she wears that ridiculous headband and her guests guess what the words are.
I thought this would be a fun game for my girls and their friends to play-especially on those sleepover nights.
The thing that many didn't like about this game that I actually was okay with was the fact that there are not a ton of cards and that the sand timer runs out quickly.
I don't know about anyone else, but my children rarely play any of these games exactly as the directions recommend.
I also teach and my students do the same thing with games in the classroom.
They modify the games to suit the needs of the group.
So when my children play this game, they extend the time.
Actually they stopped using that timer and use a different timer we have in the house.
They have also taken to using the headbands and making up their own cards to go on them to supplement the cards that come in the game.
What I like about this game is the premise is simple enough that everyone gets the gist of the game quickly but the players are not bogged down in rules.
The game can be modified without losing the point of the game.
The thing I do take a bit of an issue with is the game's price point.
I actually purchased this game prior to being offered it with Amazon Vine.
I thought the premise of the game was different than the typical games and was looking for something fun to do for a girl's sleepover.
However, at $20+ this is an expensive game!
In this price point there should be more cards and the game should come with some sort of better timer device.
This game is cute.
You wear the headband and attach to it a picture card you chose from a pile.
You then ask the other players questions to identify what/who is on your card.
It has a timer and chips, but we did not play with them.
It's a little difficult for my 6 year old.
We usually wind up giving each other hints instead of asking questions.
It is silly to try to guess the cards.
You have to have patience with yuonger ones trying to figure out who they  are.
We've had this game for over a year and we really enjoy it.
Now that they are 6 and 8, they really enjoy this guessing game and can play on their own.
It is very entertaining and allows kids to be creative and expand their descriptive abilities as they try to get their friends to guess.
Also this is fun for adults too, so it's great for family game night!
Let's start this review with 1st impressions.
The box and graphics are pretty cheesy/low-end looking.
Retail price of this game listed on amazon.com is $34.95.
If this were in a retail store and you saw it at that price, you'd still be seeing it there for the next thirty years!
This game lover would not have looked at this game if priced over $10.Okay, now we're opening the box.
Everything is just scattered throughout the box, no inner box organization of the cards, banz, etc.
We're not improving much on my first impression...have just dropped the price point to $8 as the max I would pay for the game.
There aren't even 70 cards in the deck which means there isn't much longevity to this game either (although as you read, our family of four adults wasn't able to guess any of our identities without getting clues so a deck could last us a lifetime if we only worked on questions!
)Now we have the pieces out.
The banz are nicely made for what they are and they fit all of our heads from my small one to my husband's huge one (a first!)
and they aren't uncomfortable at all.
We're laughing at how ridiculous we look already.
We each have a card in our banz and have started the game.
After two rounds of frustration and no one guessing their card, we toss the useless timer which adds nothing to the game.
Our primary entertainment is our ADD future daughter-in-law who can't remember her own questions for more than a couple of seconds.
My son, who is thoroughly bored already has taken to acting out everyone's card but his own.
"This is a fun game.
My 23 yr. old daughter, a recent college grad, & her boyfriend, in college, thought this game would be lame, but agreed to play with me anyway.
We all looked silly wearing the headbands & cards...which was the first time we laughed...and we kept laughing throughout the game.
My daughter was a snail; when she asked if she was a bug, her boyfriend said, ""no"", he answered ""yes"" to her question, ""Am I an animal?
""...who would've guessed a grown kid would think a snail was an animal....time for more laughs.
One game took us about 45 minutes to finish.
The headbands are adjustable & plenty big...even  the person with the biggest head won't have an excuse not to play.
The hourglass, sand timer kept the game fast paced.At first glance, I didn't think this game was educational...but it is.
This game will help your child with deductive reasoning, logical thinking, & memory.
My daughter's boyfriend also got a lesson about the difference between animals and bugs tonight.This is a fun, family game...a game for all ages, well ages 6 (maybe a little younger with an older partner to help out) on up to infinity.
I can't wait to play with my grandson; he's only 1 yr. old, so I have a long wait.
I can picture all of us around the table...grandma, grandpa, mommy, daddy, grandson, aunty & uncle...all looking silly wearing headbands & cards.
My only complaint is that it should come with more cards; guess we'll have to make some of our own when the time comes.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~UPDATE:  We just played this after our Thanksgiving meal with cousins ages 14 & 16, their parents, aunt, uncle & two 22 year olds.
The family had a blast!!!
Lots of laughing!
Good times!
Hedbanz is a great family game, perfect for all ages!
This is an awesome all ages game, because young children don't need to know how to read just identify pictures.
The rules are simple, it isn't time consuming and most importantly, it's really really fun!
No pieces to put together, just open the box, read the rules and start playing!
"The premise of this game is to guess what picture is over your head.
The picture is visible to everyone else but you.
In a way, this game reminds me of something called ""Indian Poker"", where everyone but you sees your card.Anyway, the idea behind this game is good, it's like a 20 questions, where you ask questions and people can say ""yes/no"".
The availability of the picture makes it so that a whole group can participate, versus one-on-one.However, here's where the hangups go.
The timer is for 45 seconds.
Consider that the average question takes about 5-10 seconds between asking and answering, we're talking about 5-10 questions before time's up.
We tried a house rule of flipping the timer an extra time (for a total of a minute and a half), but we still can't figure out the item in time!
I think the issue has to do with the timer, it messes with your head, and the questions you ask become scattered.
Perhaps if we had a new house rule and had a limited number of questions instead of relying on a set time, the game may work.
This may be especially useful when you have a diverse number of ages (young kids versus teens and adults).Also, there aren't that many cards.
I suppose we can create our own cards, but for this size game, you would think that the manufacturer would bother to give you a few more.
I'd see a cranium game, and they'd throw in about 300-500 examples.
For this game?
Not even 100.Based on the number of stars for other reviewers, I'm guessing that I'm in the minority, but I just can't love this game.
Again, great concept, but hard to play.Overall, okay game.
Could have easily been a 4 or 5 star game if they thought it through, gave game variations (like number of guesses), and gave more cards.UPDATE - 06/22/11So, it's been over half a year since we've received this item, and I must admit, the kids and wife still play it once in a while.
This game is great for kids elementary school and up.
If you have ever been annoyed with games that have too many rules or too much set up for young children, this is a great solution.
It is a great way to get families involved.
The idea is quite simple...guess the card on the other person's head.
The headband holds it so that that card can't be seen by the person wearing it.
It is a lot of fun without lots of rules.
The cards are simple enough for kids to understand.My only real complaint is that it is a little expensive if you are purchasing it.
It isn't really high tech in any way and leaves me wondering why it is more than 20 dollars.
Overall, if you have family with young children, this is a great family game!
It is pretty obvious what this game is...you wear a card on your head and ask other players questions to guess what your card is.
Reminds me of one of those old-school cocktail party ice-breaker games where people wear words on their back.
I think it does help with critical thinking and deductive reasoning skills to narrow down what the item might be, improve language skills by forming better questions, etc.
(you don't have to play with the timer if you don't want to...make up your own rules!)
I think there could be more cards, even more advanced ones without pictures (such as verbs or emotions or something....and I am sure some adults might like some different types of cards!
ha ha!!
)Maybe if we find we get to familiar with the included cards, we will make up decks of index cards with relatives names, places we visited, favorite movies, harder nouns, etc.
to use with the headbands.
It would certainly be a game that lasted forever that way!
I already reviewed this, but it's prompting me to again.
My kids love playing this game.
Not small parts to get lost, and good for a laugh watching them play with each other.
"This game is simple.
Slap a card on your forehead using the supplied band and ask others questions to try to figure out what is on the card.
As long as you don't ask, ""What am I?,"" anything goes.
For such a simple premise, the game is really a lot of fun.
For children too young to read, the pictures are clear enough and the items or animals are so common (ketchup, dog, etc.)
that there is no issue.
A timer and some plastic tokens are included if you would like to make an official game out of it, but we had more fun just taking turns.
My little nephew had some issues at first with yelling out what was on our cards to try to help us out, but he eventually understood and it was cute watching him get excited as we got closer to guessing what was on our cards using his answers.There are a few improvements that could be made.
First, the bands are one piece of molded plastic, so they don't really fit on the head very well.
This is particularly true for small heads.
Second, the card selection is pretty low.
Perhaps they just couldn't think of that many things that everyone would know.
On the bright side, it would be easy to just make your own cards by writing names on index cards.
The bands will work with any cards.In short, the game is simple and may not be your favorite game ever, but it has a lot of potential for fun with a wide range of ages.
It is a good addition to game time."
I broke this game out and the kids had a ball with it.
The moms got in on the fun and they enjoyed it as much as the kids.Games like this have been around for eons, where you guess the item of what another can see, (because in this case it's on their forehead facing the cluegiver.)
Still, this one is well-organized and two six-year olds had no trouble at all in participating.It would make a nice Christmas gift.Highly recommended.
"The game works by putting a headband on your head and then placing a picture card in a slot on the headband.
You then have to ask the other players questions to find out what is the item on your card.This Game is a lot of fun to play.
We've played it multiple times since getting it, and it's so hilarious to watch the kids play.
Our youngest likes to look around and ask questions such as ""Am I an apple.""
Of course, she's looking at the apple that someone else has on their headband.
She then asks if she's items that on are the other cards that the rest of us have.
It's pretty funny, but we set her straight and does pretty good.I thought the game would be easy, but the first time we played it, I didn't even get the first card right!
It was a pencil and I was totally asking the wrong questions getting further and further away from discovering what it was.
However, for the kids, they were able to do pretty well the first round (it's easier if you have a card for an animal as opposed to scissors or pencil).The rules are pretty simple, and it's a great game for young and old.The only downside is that the plastic headbands end up being more oval than circular and they press into your forehead and leave a pretty good indentation (even though it's not tight).
I assume after we play it for a while, they'll stretch out a little better (or we'll get flatter foreheads, on of the two)."
"On ICarly and in the episode, iWas A Pageant Girl, Spencer and Freddie play a game called ""What Am I?
""""What Am I?""
consists of wearing a headband on your head, sticking a word in the holder on the front and guessing what you are by asking questions and using the answers from your opponent to guess who or what you are.Well, it's real a real game now and it's made by Spin Master.
Hedbanz Game for Kids just happens to be my granddaughter's favorite game.
You can play with just two people or a group of up to six.
Included are:  Hedbanz rule sheet, 74 kid friendly cards featuring animal, food or common objects, sample question cards, 24 point chips, 6 very comfortable and adjustable headbands, and a one minute sand-clock timer.This game is simple and fun to play!
After dealing one card and three chips to each player, take your card and place it in your adjustable headband without peeking.
When your turn arrives, ask each player a question about who, or what, you are (""Am I a food?"").
If you get stuck, the sample questions card offers tips on the types of questions you might ask.When you get a yes, your questions will become more specific (""Am I cooked?"")
until you're ready to guess the answer (""I am spaghetti!"").
For each identity you guess correctly, you'll discard one of your chips.
If you give up, you'll collect a chip from the chip bank and be dealt a new card.
The first player to get rid of all her chips is the Hedbanz winner.There is also a version of Hedbanz for Adults.
Hopefully, Spin Master will release an expansion pack of cards for more varied play but in the meantime, you can do what Spencer and Freddie did and make your own on plain ol' index cards!Happy Gaming!"
What a fun gome for the whole family.Even our 3 year old likes to play and can do pretty well.I realy like that this game has a quick set up, and can be a quickly played kind of game.The headbanz fit all head sizes well and had fun pictures.
We got this in the mail today and when my kids got done with their homework they were rewarded with this game.
They are ages 15, 12, and 11, and you thought this was for smaller children?
They loved this game and played it over and over.
If you know any college kids now a days the in thing is playing preschool and small kid's games.
College kids would love this game right along with all the other kids games they love.
We know several college kids that are now playing Candy Land like they never played it before.
This game is for all ages, and is fast paced.
Just put the plastic band on your head and attach one card drawn from the deck and place it on the head band without looking at it first.
Only the other players can see your card.
You have to ask them if you're and animal, or flower, or whatever you think you might be.
If they say yes, then you ask them if you have stripes, or if you roar, or something like that.
Then you guess what your card is.
The one who guess right first, wins.
Great laughs, and good clean fun.
Worth playing with your kids on family night.
Whoo-hoo!
My husband and I played this with our 14, 11 and 6 year olds.
It was fun, but I would say this is a game for 7+ (which is what the game itself recommends).
Our six year old had fun, but the asking of yes or no questions was sometimes tough for him and he would get easily frustrated.
(of course that might just be my son, but this is our experience with the game).The game was fun, and at times we would be stumped for a question, leading to some rather silly moments and lots of laughter.
A couple questions would leave the other players confused and again lots of laughing and giggling around the table.The game itself is simple: there are plastic headbands with little clips in the front, you put the headbands around your head, pop a card (NO peeking!)
in the front and go around the table asking yes or no questions of the other players.
There is a timer and if you happen to guess what you are in the allotted time you can pick another card and keep going until your time runs out.There are cards with suggested questions and that did help our younger boys.
My only issue is the price I am seeing here.
There are no electronic components in the game, and in fact the pieces consist of little more than plastic headbands, paper cards, a timer and some little plastic chips, I would NOT pay $30 for this game.While the game is a cute idea and we had fun, I wouldn't spend more than $15, anything more and it is nothing more than an overpriced trendy game of the moment.
