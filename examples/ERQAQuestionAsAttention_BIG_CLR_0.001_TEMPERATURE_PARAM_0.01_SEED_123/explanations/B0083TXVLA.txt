Top sentence(s):
The unit comes in 2 pieces which easily snap together.
It gets them running around chasing each other and finding the balls.
It required 3 AA batteries which were not included.
The sound effects start out as fun, and when they get old, you can always turn them off.- This is great for indoor target practice, or even for a little person v. person action.- The balls are a little bigger than a golf or ping pong ball, and a little smaller than a baseball.
Naturally the younger one doesn't get to play with it since he's not old enough.

Boys will be boys.
My nephews, four and eight years old, immediately fought over this Solar Recon ball launcher when I let them have a go at it.Likes:>Easy to assemble: just place 3 AA batteries in the battery compartment (tool/Philips screwdriver required to open cover), snap on the ball loader, and it's ready to roll.>Bright, flashy design with cool sounds to keep the kids amazed.>Hours of shoot 'em up fun with safe, soft Koosh Balls.
My bro still made his kids wear their protective, mini sports goggles (OK).>Some educational value of how the lights charge up the glow-in-the-dark balls.Slight dislikes:>With only one Solar Recon ball launcher, the other child had to retaliate with hisNerf Super Soaker Scatter Blast.
Ammo Advantage: Super Soaker but the parents don't allow Super Soakers in the house.
Indoors Advantage: Koosh Ball launcher.>To make it fair, my bro had to buy aGalaxy Space Agent Blaster, and twoGalaxy Ball Clip Accessory with 3 Ballsso the kids can duke it out.
Advantage: Hasbro design and marketing.Overall:Fun launcher toys that were designed for safe space adventures but additional ball launchers, clips, and Koosh balls recommended so all the kids can play.
Questionable long-term interest/playability.
These are not the old style elastic string koosh balls of my youth but instead are sleek, smooth and glow in the dark when charged by the launcher.
The launcher was easy to assemble and we had it put together in minutes.
It required 3 AA batteries which were not included.
You can launch the balls with or without the lights and sound effects.
However, since the light is what 'charges' the glow in the dark effect of the balls, you'll need to move the switch to the on position on the side of the launcher before shooting.
The sounds effects are fairly loud, but even when the lights and sound effects are turned off, the launcher is not a quiet toy.
My spouse and child took great pleasure in chasing each other around the house, shooting at each other in a game of hide and seek.
Both agreed that the balls stung just a little bit, although definitely no aiming at the head or any of the pets.The attached storage arm which dispenses the balls into the launcher is a nice concept.
It keeps all the balls together when not in play and they don't fall out if the launcher is turned upside down.
There is also extra balls available for purchasing in a variety of colors.
You can buy a ball clip that stores extra balls and is compatible with this launcher, according to the manufacturer's website.
Personally, I think if you have more than one child, you're going end up having to buy each child their own launcher and it's probably smart to stock up on extra balls.
Overall, it's a loud, flashy toy that most kids will enjoy.
My kids are having a blast with this toy!
The gun light ups and has cool sound effects.
The balls shoot far, and I don't think they'd hurt if they hit you (but I still tell my kids not to shoot at each other).
It's easy to assemble and easy to use.
Lots of fun!
"Reviewing a product that seems on the whole to be good but turns out defective is difficult.
Do I tell you how much fun the gun was to shoot?
For sure, it was a ""blast"".
Assembly couldn't be simpler.
Just unscrew a simple set screw to access the battery compartment where you put in 3 AA batteries.
The feed tube attaches with no tools required, just snapping into place on the gun itself.
Simply load up the foam balls and pump the gun to shoot.Each ball has a nice weight despite being foam and shoots a good distance.
My kids had fun firing it all over the house, and I didn't worry about them breaking anything.
Even my 4 year old could easily load the balls into the feed tube and shoot them.So why just 3 stars?
The switch to turn on the lights/sounds part of the gun is defective!
The firing mechanism is purely mechanical, so my kids had fun without it, but to get the gun to light up, I had to push the switch to the on position and hold it with my finger the whole time (with hard pressure pushing towards ""on"").
LED's inside the gun light it up and a cool futuristic space gun sound plays, but as soon as I removed pressure from the switch, it didn't work.
It just seems like it has a faulty part on it.
Given the cost of this relatively simply plastic toy gun, it is surprising that they have such poor quality control.So 3 stars for a toy that is fun in concept, enjoyable even without the batteries, but ultimately falls short for me because mine was defective.
I'd recommend you buy it from a store with a good return policy.
***Update***I had to drop my review down to just 1 star!
I have two boys, one who just turned four, and the other is two and a half.
Naturally the younger one doesn't get to play with it since he's not old enough.
But the older one absolutely loves his new toy, the sounds it makes are cool, the glow in the dark balls are really neat, and it shoots them quite far, yet not hard enough to break anything bigger than, say, a glass on a table (so be careful for those).
The balls glow in the dark brightly enough for the glow to be noticeable in a hallway without direct lighting, so you don't have to be in absolute darkness to enjoy that feature of the toy.
I let him play with it for a good half hour yesterday, and the younger boy was kind enough to go chase the balls down for his older brother (they're so cute at that age); and this morning he was asking to play with it again.One tip, make sure to put the magazine (the tube that holds the balls to load them into the chamber) all the way in; the toy won't work at all if it's only halfway inserted.
I was fully convinced it was dead on arrival until I took a real close look at it.
The facts: This baby holds four glow in the dark springy balls in its feed tube, and fires them one at a time when you pull the front stock back sharply (like racking a shell in a shotgun).
You can leave the power off, in which case it just fires the balls, or put in three AA batteries and turn the thing on, in which case it has an array of sound effects and lights, some of which help to charge the balls for extra glow.What I liked:- This is totally fun!
The balls are safe for indoor use, and pop and fly impressively.
The sound effects start out as fun, and when they get old, you can always turn them off.- This is great for indoor target practice, or even for a little person v. person action.- The balls are a little bigger than a golf or ping pong ball, and a little smaller than a baseball.
This seems to be a good size to minimize lost ammo.What could be better:- The feed tube is a little sensitive, so if you hold the gun much off a straight line, you may not get fed the next ball.- Although my six year old could pull the stock back hard enough to fire, the act of pulling back the stock consistently threw off her aim.
Adults and older kids will be able to use this for target practice, but many younger kids will find it hard to hold the gun steady while firing.Ultimately, though, even though I had some complaints, the smiles from my family when I turned this thing on won the day.
Not perfect, but fun enough to get to five stars, maybe four and a half on a cranky day.
The KOOSH GALAXY SOLAR RECON LAUNCHER is a cute little shooter that feels good in your hand.
It shoots soft little ping pong balls that only hurt when they hit you smack in the face (voice of experience).
It's easy to aim but keeping the aim is hard since there's no trigger.
There's a pump that loads a ball into the chamber.
To fire, you pump it a second time which moves the entire unit.
That's not good, but what's worse is that it only carries 4 balls.
There's no way to load more, even if you bought extras.
Between the lack of trigger and the tiny magazine, you end up missing a lot and fetching a lot.
Not really what I want out of my indoor shooter.
My family had a lot more fun with the previously reviewed NERF VORTEX LUMITRON.
This should have been a lot of fun, but ended up being a lot of running around.
"Contrary to the game blurb, you will need a screwdriver to open up the battery compartment to insert the batteries.
Also, the batteries are not included so have three AA-sized batteries available.
Though a plus is that the batteries are not needed to operate the launcher, only to power the sound and light effects.My test subjects were aged four and seven and they both had a blast with this toy.
They loved the spacey sound effects, liked the blue LED light and had an easy time operating the pump action.
The balls glow a soft green after they have been exposed to the LED.
The balls shoot out fast and far, but they don't hurt if you are hit by them, and so far they haven't broken anything.
If you are shooting it indoors, be aware of ricochets, which can make the balls harder to find.
I noticed that the shooting mechanism did jam occasionally, but it was easy to fix.
Though after watching the four year old try to fix the jam while looking down the barrel of the launcher, it should be stressed to the young ones NEVER to look down the barrel; I had to bring out the ""You'll shoot your eye out!""
line.
=)Bottom line, it's a fun toy for both boys and girls.
It gets them running around chasing each other and finding the balls.
I noticed, too, that the adults who tried it out were a little reluctant to give it back to the kids - lol.
The launcher comes with four balls and we found that balls that they already had for a different Koosh shooter also fit in this launcher."
My son is almost 4 years old so i figured it would be alright for him to try this out along with his 6 year old sister to see what they think.
All I have to say is that I'm going to have to purchase one for all of us because these are way fun.
Very easy to put together, anyone should be able to figure it out.You will need a screwdriver for the compartment that contains the batteries also some batteries will be a good thing to pick up as well but as a side note the gun shoots without them.I wish they came with more then four glow in the dark balls but it is still fun.
Makes noise and lights up and is a blast to play with in the dark.
Im sure it will hold their interest just as well as any other toy they have.As far as shooting them at each other goes they do hurt at close range and by that I mean like a couple feet, other then that its not to bad.The Launcher itself seems durable but only time will tell how it holds up and how long the batteries last.
If there is anything out of the usual I'll update my review.
Great product, a lot of fun, I would definitely recommend this product!

for learning how to engage in night attacks.
The problem with most nerf-like guns is that when the sun goes down so do the guns because you just can't find the projectiles once fired.
Well, the Koosh solves that problem with its glow-in-th-dark bullets.
My boys love it--and I love having them out of the house for a while longer.
I'm impressed by just how cool this blaster was and it exceeded my expectations.Basically, the ball enters the chamber when you have the handle all the way forward, some UFO sound accompanies a light inside the gun which charges the ball glow even in a totally dark room, then after 20 seconds or so, you can launch a round in the dark and see the soft glowing ball bounce around.My only complaint was that the gun seemed impossible to fire at first (I struggled as a relatively in-shape 200 lb.
man), but after several shots, the mechanism loosened up to the point where my four-year-old could fire at will.Neat!
My 10-year old granddaughter and 3-year old grandson love this Koosh Galaxy ball shooter.
This toy is easy to assemble.
Batteries are not included but the three AA batteries are only required for the sound effects.
The ball shooter works without batteries.
The balls shoot hard and quite a distance so some safety precautions are required.
Otherwise things can get out of hand pretty quickly.
Keep the pets away.
Don't let the kids aim the shooter at people.
The balls are fairly soft but they hurt if you get hit at close range.
The balls often jam in the chamber but it's easy to get them out.
The kids had a blast with this toy until they lost all the balls and couldn't find them.
Since they glow in the dark perhaps it will be easier to find them once it gets dark.
Well, this gets a thumbs up from my 7 year old son!
The unit comes in 2 pieces which easily snap together.
The unit is powered by 2 AA batteries which are easy to install / requires a screw driver.It shoots semi-soft balls and comes with 4 of them.
My son suggested trying it out by shooting each other point-blank for this review and we did that.
They do sting just a bit but no real pain.
It would be good to keep them away from the eyes!The balls do glow / we tested this in a dark bathroom and look forward to playing with this at night as well.
This has a powerful shot, though it isn't so hard as to sting if you're shot at close range.
(I don't recommend it, but my 3yo son doesn't aim well, so it happens.)
I do think we'll be purchasing extra balls as a refill and the add-on koosh ball clip, since it can get tedious to chase after four balls.
(Also, I think the dog will end up chewing one of the balls!)
It's easy enough for all of us to shoot an play with, and we've had hours of fun with it already.The reason is loses a star is that it jams occasionally.
It's a quick fix - just dump the balls out via the tube they feed in, and you're good - but it's a bit of an annoyance.
"The ""glow in the dark"" is a nice touch if you're outside at night or twilight.
My friend's kids had a blast with this launcher.
It's the perfect size for young kids.
The electric lights and sound effects are also a nice touch, but can easily grate on the nerves if the playing goes on for a little too long.
Operation is a breeze.
Not too educational, as reflected in my rating, but I guess hand-eye-coordination can be improved by trying to hit targets with this.
The durability is pretty good, though my friend's kid managed to crack the casing with a not-very-hard hit against a tree.
Luckily the launcher continued to work without being affected.
You'll need three AA batteries, which will of course require regular replacement if the toy gets used a lot."
"High praise indeed from our 8 year old.
We got this in the mail, and before I even knew we got a package, our 8 and 4 year old had ripped it open.
Obviously, they were expecting the Recon Launcher, and no my boys aren't in the habit of ripping open random boxes.""WOW!
Mom, Look at it!""
our 8 year old was shoving the box in my face.
""Back up, I can't even see it.""
I admonished him, taking the box from him.The Koosh Galaxy Solar REcon Launcher is indeed cool looking.
With five boys, water guns and the like are indeed popular in our house, but this is our first Koosh.I avoided putting batteries in for a few days, I'll admit it many toys of this type drive me crazy.
But the noise is definitely cool, and though I can tell it will drive me bonkers at some point, our 8 year old declared it ""Awesome!
""There are four foam balls that glow in dark (you can buy extra right here-5 for about $4) and again, our younger boys declared them, ""Pretty cool!
They work, cause I can see them.""
They were tested in my laundry room with the lights off.It's a tad pricey for me, but this is certainly something I would buy for a birthday or Christmas present, as opposed to ""Hey were in the store, let's grab a little treat.
""The balls do not sting, though I would refrain from aiming them at someone's face, and about 20 minutes after playing with this, our boys asked for another Koosh launcher (the yellow bow was requested).This is a neat addition to their arsenal, it's different from the little foam darts that other shooters like this pump out.
I much prefer these foam balls, and will be on the lookout for additional launchers for the boys."
My 3.5 year old daughter had a hard time using this for the very first time since it requires some energy to pull the trigger and propel the ball forward.
But once she learnt it, she is just loving it.The thing I like about this is that:(1) Safety: The foam balls are pretty safe - even though they travel pretty fast, it is very unlikely to cause any injury(2) Durable: Built from good quality plastic(3) Easy to use: It is very easy to use, just put the ball into the top hopper, position the trigger and pull it to propel the ball forward
