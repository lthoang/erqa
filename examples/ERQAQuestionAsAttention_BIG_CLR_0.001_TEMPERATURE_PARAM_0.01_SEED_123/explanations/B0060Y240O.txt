Top sentence(s):
(ha!).
The ""bullets"" didn't go very far, but since this is primarily a kid's toy, that was a plus in my book.
They shoot far and the aim is true.
This button must be depressed when firing.
I noticed a few things- first it has a very cool modernistic look with a ""bull-pup"" design, which was very nice.

Reviews:
"""Wow,"" I thought.
""SEVEN batteries for a toy gun?""
Then I started playing with the thing and promptly forgot about the batteries.
I fired it up and took it out in the backyard, and the next thing the neighbors knew, yellowish tracers were zipping through the night sky.
After a couple of clips, I handed it over to my 6-year-old, who proceeded to make like a berserk Clone Trooper.
The range isn't fantastic (especially considering the 4 batteries in the firing mechanism), but it's enough to get a nice effect.
I could turn on the ""charger"" clip and within a couple of seconds fire off all 18 darts, each brightly streaking across my yard to splat against the back wall of my house.
It's kind of expensive for a simple toy, but it certainly performs as advertised.4 batteries power the dart-firing mechanism, while 3 more go in the clip to charge up the glowing darts.
There's an on/ off switch on the clip, so you can use the gun in the daytime without running down the batteries.
There are two triggers: hold down the lower one to spin up the launch motor, and pull the upper one to send the next dart on its way.
The motor trigger doesn't require a lot of strength, so it's easy to hold it down and blast away.
The firing trigger needs a little oomph and has a long throw, so the maximum fire rate is about 1 round per second.
Reloading the clip is kind of a hassle (my kid needed a bit of guidance at first), but it's probably as easy as it could be.
The generous 18-round capacity mitigates this a bit.The gun uses a modular system that's compatible with other Nerf guns and accessories.
The clip is interchangeable, and there are connectors for various attachments that can be purchased separately.
Collectors should appreciate the flexibility.
"This is a cool, fun addition to the Nerf arsenal.
If only all wars were fought with Nerf guns, the world would be a better place.This gun takes a lot of batteries, but it needs them for two different things.
One set propels the darts while the other set lights a special light that ""charges up"" the darts so they glow in the dark.
That's just plain cool.The darts shoot far, and the clip holds a lot of them.
Your enemy better run fast, because even the worse shot is bound to have a few hits sooner or later.I love the entire series of Nerf dart guns, and this one happily fits right in.
Get some for the kids, one for you, hide the cats, and have a blast."
This is a really cool idea for a nerf gun...it uses batteries to power the gun so that you don't have to pump it before shooting.
This makes it much easier to fire quickly and seems less prone to jamming.There's two triggers on this gun.
There's the standard trigger for firing and a second one just below that to prime it.
You have to hold down the second trigger while pulling the first in order to fire a shot.
Trying to pull the primary trigger without holding the second one won't let you fire.
Releasing the second trigger turns off the motor as there's no on/off switch.
The motor isn't loud but you won't be able to sneak up on someone with it running.What's nice about this setup is that you can fire quickly, it doesn't take any strength to prime the gun, doesn't jam often, and you can release the clip at any time.
On pump style guns, you have to have the pump in a certain position to be able to release or insert the clip.
With this gun, you can do it at any time.Drawbacks of this setup are that you're dependant on batteries as the gun won't fire without turning on the motor, the motor takes a second or two to come up to speed, and the noise of the motor means everyone knows where you are when you getting ready to fire.The other somewhat awkward design choice is the placement of the clip.
It's situated behind the trigger meaning your arm is sort of wrapped around it.
This was probably done to keep the weight balanced, but it's a less natural way to hold something.
Additionally the batteries for the clip are on the right side of it.
The is better for lefties but for righties it's just one more thing in the way.The batteries for the clip are optional.
They power 4 bright blue LEDs that charge up the glow in the dark darts.
What's nice about the darts is that both the tips and the body glow without he use of those glow in the dark wrappers from previous models of darts.
The LEDs do a decent job of charging them in the short time they spend in the clip.
My Son has several Nerf N Strike guns that range from the Automatic Stampede to the manual single shot Maverick.
I thought this Rayven would be a perfect complement but it turned out to be a very weak and dull shooter.
The gun takes 7 AA batteries in total divided between the clip and the gun itself.
The clip takes batteries to power a UV light that makes the special darts glow in the dark.
This glow in the dark feature works well and has an on/off switch to save battery life when you are firing in the day.
The gun itself seems underpowered when compared to others such as the Stampede.
The mechanism requires you to hold down a button to power a motor before you can pull the trigger and actually fire a dart.
If the motor button isn't held down long enough then the darts are not fired with enough force to really be fun.
To make matters worse as the batteries deplete the gun fires with even less force making it useless in a Nerf gun battle.
Overall it is a good looking gun but the 2 button firing system and the relatively weak shots make it less fun than other Nerf Guns.
*** Positive Points: ***- Interchangeable clips with other Nerf guns- Glow in the dark darts work well and are priceless in nighttime battles- Lightweight and easy to hold for younger children*** Negative Points: ***- Relatively weak shooting strength (when compared to other Nerf guns)- Unnecessarily fussy having to hold down the motor button before pulling the trigger- Requires 7 AA batteries total (3 for the clip to charge the glow in the dark darts and 4 for the gun)
After seeing my 4 year old daughter coming right at me, gleam in her eye, maniacally laughing while emptying a full 18 dart clip into me, I can say that yes, children enjoy this toy.This is the second Nerf weapon in the house, the first being a revolver which requires a fair amount of strength to pull back the slide between shots making it tough on the young ones who would have to go ask daddy to arm it for them.
This one, you just arm it by pulling back the motor trigger and fire with the main trigger.
One shot per pull, so this is a semi-automatic.
Range is OK but less than manual pistol, and like all Nerf dart weapons, the ammo quickly gets lost under couches or whatever dimensional rift they seem to fall in.
My children are surprisingly accurate probably due to the good balance and low trigger weights.Be sure to read the instructions.
Before realizing I needed to install extra batteries for the clip lamp, I thought the glowing darts were lame, now I realize how cool seeing darts streak across a darkened room can be.So in general a fun simulated weapon that makes it easier for the younger set to enjoy.
Just try to keep the from aiming head high, probably not good for eyes or front teeth.
A very nice semi-auto dart blaster.
It uses the Nerf clip system and motorized flywheels to fire darts.
This one also has glow in the dark darts and a magazine that shines a light on them to make them glow.Likes1) Standardized Nerf modular format.
This means it can use any of the Nerf clip magazines, rail accessories and front barrels.2) Compact.
The flywheels are positioned vertically to save space.
This blaster is not much bigger than some 1 handed ones.3) 18 dart magazine.Comments:1) I'm not a great fan of any motorized dart blaster.
That's because batteries cost money, but most of all, there's a time lag between pulling the trigger and shooting the darts out.
Though the time lag here can be minimized because a second button controls the motor.2) Even though this motor is quieter than most motorized blasters, it still creates a noise that your enemy can hear.
With a motorized blaster, you just can't approach anyone silently without a firing lag.3) The glow in the dark system is neat, but I'd rather have my enemy glow in the dark than my bullets!Overall, very decent.
A nice compact motorized blaster capable of 18 shots.
I really think nerf makes awesome products across the board.This gun, if age appropriate CAN actually help kids with eye hand coordination when aiming.
and if your in a fast paced nerf battle - rapid reloading can also help them.So with that said, this gun was just alot of fun.
It seems sturdy and durable.
This is a very neat gun.
Here are the basics:If you already have a mag-loading NERF gun from the N-Strike series, then this is not very different.
However, the firing mechanism is a little different.
Let me explain:I also own the Stampede ECS-50 (see my other reviews and you will find it).
The stampede is much heavier than the Rayven, but it uses the same clip and loads the same darts.
The difference?
The Stampede takes SIX DD BATTERIES!!
The result?
Fully automatic dart action.
You can go through a clip of 18 darts in about 6 seconds.
The problem?
It's BIG and HEAVY!!
The dart firing mechanism in this model utilizes a giant plug attached to a spring which is pulled back by a motor (powered by the batteries) and released, shooting the darts forward.
When the trigger is pulled, it activates the motor and just keeps pumping out darts until you let go.The Rayven uses a different technique.
There is a button NEXT TO the trigger, which you must press prior to pulling the trigger.
This button must be depressed when firing.
We've got a few different Nerf guns and have been known to have Nerf wars - I was really excited to get to review this product and let me just say this: this is my new favorite Nerf gun.PROS:-Easy to take out of the package.
Okay, this may seem minor but there is nothing more annoying than trying to get something out of a package and fighting with it for two hours.
This is really easy to get out of the package.-Easy to put together.
The battery insert was very easy to handle as well, although we have not yet put any batteries in the clip as it seems a bit wasteful.-Fires wonderfully.
It's a lot more accurate than theNerf N-Strike Stampede ECSthat we have, and a LOT lighter as well!-We also love that the clip goes right into the Stampede as well.CONS:-Do you really need to have batteries in the clip to light up the darts?
That's a bit annoying - BUT we like that you don't HAVE to have the batteries in the clip to make it work.We were all very impressed with this Nerf - our two children have decided it's the best Nerf gun in the house and it's the perfect way to annoy the cats :).
"My grandson has been playing with this toy for a while.
He is 5 1/2 years old.
He called me on the phone to tell me all about this toy and how the bullets ""glow"".
He says it shoots pretty far across the room.
He has been telling me about this toy multiple times when we talk on the phone, so I think it is a big hit with him.
He has a ""lot"" of toys, so the fact that he is still excited about it means it is a fun toy for a small boy.I don't like the idea of the batteries that are necessary to fire the darts and to make the darts glow,(7 AA batteries) but that makes it a lot of fun for my grandson.Also, it makes nice sound effects that my grandson loves."
"I took my 2 little cousins (ages 8 & 10)out ""shooting"" with the Nerf N-Strike Rayven last weekend and we had a blast.
We set up little targets and had contests to see who could knock the most down.
Although this gun features glow in the dark bullets, we only used it during the day, so I can not comment on that feature, but it does make it more interesting.The Rayven used a lot of batteries and it seemed to suck up the juice pretty quickly.
It also took longer to recharge in-between shots than I would have liked.
That said, it was easy to load, even for the kids, and it was well-balanced and easy for them to manipulate.
The ""bullets"" didn't go very far, but since this is primarily a kid's toy, that was a plus in my book.
I didn't have to worry about anyone shooting an eye out.
Overall this was a fun toy that the kids and I had a lot of fun with.
It seems durable and I can't wait to try it at night to see the bullets glow in the dark."
"(FYI: both my 6 yr old & I shoot left-handed; we set up an indoor shooting gallery with plastic bowling pins due to the snow & wind in our area.
)1) It takes SEVEN AAA batteries; three batteries for the clip & four for the gun.2) The clip holds 18 darts & has a special blue light that ""charges"" up the darts to glow.
There is an on & off switch on the clip for the glow light.3) My 6 yr old could easily load the dart-bullets into the clip and could easily insert & remove the clip from the gun.4) There are two triggers that need to be pulled at the same time: the accelerator & the launcher.
Due to his small hands, my son used his index & middle finger to launch and kept his ring & pinky fingers on the accelerator.
Younger kids might not be able to use this gun at all due to the bulky shape despite being lightweight.5) The sight is off...the darts favor heading to the right.
We compensated by aiming just left of our targets.6) The darts get great distance (we had 12' clearance for our gallery) but light impact.
Even with a direct hit on plastic bowling pins, we had to move within 6'for optimal effect...which means there is a very slim chance of accidents and/or injuries.7) Clips are interchangeable between guns and you can buy clips & dart packs separately for additional ammo.8) Did have a jamming problem, but only once & it may have had something to do with my son struggling to keep his grip on both triggers.9) Nice sound effect...a type of sci-fi hum but not loud..quiter than a vacuum - kind of like a remote control vehicle.10) Wish it had a strap; it is possible to connect your own...looks like the gun was designed to have a strap but one was not included."
I got this for my 7 year old nephew.
He loved it right away.
It is really light-weight and he loved that the darts glow in the dark (though not very well).
I don't know much about these guns but apparently this price is pretty common for this toy and easy to figure out how to use.
This needs batteries to work (it does not come with any) but as far as I could tell it was the only negative.
My nephew gave it a positive review and that is good enough for me!
We have about 15 Nerf guns (not counting our arsenal of Nerf water guns) and we are always excited about having more.
The Nerf N-Strike Rayven is just as fun as the other dart and disc guns we have.
My son says it's the best one we've had so far (he must be assuming more are on the way).
Previously, the Nitron was his favorite.If you're familiar with Nerf dart guns, this works as it should.
The clip holds 18 darts.
They shoot far and the aim is true.
This is a semi-automatic gun, so the darts shoot out rapidly.
Clips from our other Nerf N-Strike guns fit the Rayven, so it is easy to slot a loaded clip into place and continue firing.
It is surprisingly lightweight and easy for my kids, ages 4 through 7, to handle.
It takes 4 AA batteries and our first batch is still running strong.The darts that come with this gun glow in the dark.
We installed the additional 3 AA batteries for this feature to make sure it worked.
It did.
A blue light sort of charges the darts so they will glow and it works quite well in dark rooms.
We then uninstalled the batteries and no longer use this feature because we have way too many toys, play tents and pieces of furniture to be running around in the dark.
This is probably a really fun feature if you have a large, flat, empty, dark area in which to play.If you've tried and enjoyed other Nerf dart guns, this one should please you too.
It's been a lot fun for our family.
"Sometimes us adults get roped into the kid's game.
Of course, with great reluctance.
(ha!).
Anyway, I saw  this nifty little toy Nerf gun and thought that at last I'd have something to give me an edge in combat, since I am older, slower and a bigger target.
I noticed a few things- first it has a very cool modernistic look with a ""bull-pup"" design, which was very nice.
But I wasn't happy it needed seven (count `em 7!)
AA batteries.
However, I am hardly a Nerf expert.So, our resident Nerf expert was called in to aid me in ""torture testing"" the gun.
Here's what Jared, age 13 has to say about the Rayven.
""A great addition to anyone's arsenal and a fast shooter.
More towards lefties with scopes and or light fixtures from certain other guns such as the maverick.
Though if you played borderlands it closely resembles the sub machine guns of the game as well.
Another thing is that it is very resourceful with ammunition.The bad things are that it's very loud and tiring to reload because it makes a louder noise.
Plus that it's very small and easily lost as is the Recon CS-6 from earlier years.
It is also very loud in color not sound waves.
It is also very susceptible to confrontation and being found quickly.The fact is that it's a useful gun and even though the glow-in-the-dark stuff doesn't work, and even then it's a good gun.
