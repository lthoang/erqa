Questions:
Problems with Vtech's Learning Lodge Navigator? Is anyone else having problem with the Learning Lodge Navigator download from vtech's website?  I have tried downloading it on 3 different computers now and I keep getting the same error message:  you need to download Adobe Flash.  I tried downloading the latest verson of Flash and re-installing the software, but still no luck.  The Vtech support tells me there is no problem with their product.  I think I'm going to return it.  The email address they have on their website won't even work.
Can apps be shared between 2 InnoTabs? Just as the topic states. I am wanting to know do you have to buy 2 of the same apps for 2 innotabs or can it be shared? I know the Leappad can be shared but I have not found out if Vtech apps can. Thanks.
Innotab not keeping date/time? We got my 5yo son an Innotab for Christmas and he's really enjoying it so far.  Other than the insane battery usage (he's had it 2 days and it's already on it's 4th set of batteries) I've noticed one weird problem:Everytime you turn the Innotab on, it asks you to set the date and time, which are always set to 1/1/2010 and 12:00am.  We've managed to see two times where it didn't ask to set the time -- but the other 15-25 times we've seen it turned on it asks this.  Is anyone else having this problem?  My 5 year old is fascinated with turning things on/off/messing with settings, so I'm not ruling out the chance he's changing a setting and/or popping out the batteries on me.Just curious if anyone else is having this problem.Thanks,Josh
Music from itunes? have problems downloading the music from itunes.  found it in file manager, but will not "choose" so that i can transfer.  Suggestions?  Same goes for the photos in Library (on my Mac).
Problems turning it on We just bought this for our daughter for Christmas and after working with it for only 30 minutes, it no longer turns on.  We do not have the AC adapter, but have put in 4 sets of brand new batteries to no avail.  All we get is a milli-second of light on the screen and then it turns off.  Any suggestions?  I am a desperate, thanks.
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
NOTE!!!!!
This product is almost useless without an SD card!
That must be figured into your cost consideration when purchasing this item.Additional Note: This particular toy is being used for an older child (currently 10).
While I know that, truly, it is a bit childish for a child who bought her own Kindle, we have reasons for letting her claim this InnoTab.
For a review more specifically related to a younger child, see my review of the pink InnoTab.The InnoTab is rated for children ages 4-9.
While it's easy for a four-year-old to learn, there are a few features that make this tablet appealing to the older range as well.- MP3 player.
Any songs (of the right format, naturally) can be downloaded onto the SD card on the InnoTab and played with pretty decent sound.- The SD card feature makes it fairly easy to put the music, pictures, video, etc., on the InnoTab.
The screen quality is pretty decent as well.- There is a notepad for taking notes.- There is a calendar feature that does allow notes to be placed on individual dates for scheduling.There are general pros to this product, again most of these being with older children in mind:- All of the features mentioned above are on the InnoTab at purchase.
Plus, there is the option to download up to three more downloadable products with the three free Vcoins provided upon registration.- The downloadable games, books, and apps are reasonably priced when compared to other similar toys.
The quality seems to be about the same, as does the educational value.- All background music/noise can be turned off on an individual game basis.
Also, the volume control is a button easily accessed on the frame of the tablet, and can be completely turned down.
The only essential sound on the InnoTab is the start-up sound.- A stand allows the tablet to be propped up in either portrait or landscape format.- The SD card slot is not exposed, but is easily accessible in the battery compartment.- Once downloadable products are purchased, they can be used on multiple InnoTabs.There are some cons to this product as well.- Battery life is rough!
Products like these really, really, really should either come with an internal rechargeable battery or with an A/C adapter that does not have to be purchased separately.- Not easily transferred from one child to another.
Only one child at a time can be listed at start-up or registered online.
While it is easy to switch users, there is no way to separately customize this product.All in all, my oldest likes the InnoTab.
We are not a family that provides cell phones or expensive electronics for our children.
"The Vtech is less expensive.
Looking at the current Amazon listings, much less expensive.The Vtech is ""faster"".
By that I mean it powers on and off more quickly.
Also, games seem to start more quickly.Voice prompts.
They are about equal.
I think the same guy recorded the lexicons for both machines.Clarity of instructions.
Both machines are very good.Screen responsiveness.
From my experiences the LeapPad is better.
There are some times when the Vtech just doesn't respond.Styli.
The LeapPad comes with a soft tipped stylus to protect the screen.
It broke right away.
However, by daughter manages just fine with her finger.
The Vtech comes with a hard tipped stylus and is not likely to break.
That's good because with the Vtech there are times when you need a stylus.
That's bad because I can see the screen getting damaged.Durability.
The LeapPad feels more durable.Sharing.
My 7 year old daughter has both this and the Leap Pad tablet.
I asked her if she had to keep one and give the other one away, which one she would keep, and she said it was a toss up.
The two products are comparable and, to my mind, pretty much equal in terms of durability, user-friendliness, fun for kids .
.

I would give the Leap Pad a slight edge over the Innotab on educational value, because my feeling is the Innotab stresses fun more while the Leap Pad strives a bit harder for there to be learning involved in all the enjoyability.
I would choose the Leap Pad over the Innotab in a pinch, but I recommend both.
"UPDATE: 1/5/12Vtech decided to sneak in an update and I can no longer put ANY videos on my son's Innotab.
The ones I transferred before still work, but any I try to put on the SD card now, even ones that I know previously worked and were accidentally deleted no longer appear using the same methods I always had.
I get a ""memory card error"" every single time the Innotab starts now and the new videos will not show up.
Given that the educational and design value of the Innotab is far lower than that of the LeapPad and now that it doesn't even function as a video player, I can't recommend this toy.
Not only did they botch the video transfer process, but Vtech support is horrible.
They double charged me on a single app purchase and won't even return my emails nor respond to my PayPal claim to get a refund.
Thankfully, PayPal came through and refunded me my money because Vtech would not respond to their inquiries either.
Horrible, horrible, horrible customer service!
We will NEVER buy Vtech again.UPDATE #2: 2/4/12We brought the InnoTab with us to Disney World to help keep my son entertained during the long drive (~25 hour drive one way) and I also brought my old iPod 3G 64GB that I haven't used much recently.
The night before we left I was up until 4am converting video files for the InnoTab which consists of changing the properties to be compatible with the InnoTab and then running it through a second program to increase the audio volume because for some unknown reason the InnoTab silences the audio on video files that have normal volume on any other device.
This increases the file size so you have to degrade the video quality even more to make them a reasonable file size, which is still more than double what they would be in an iPod-friendly format.
This is all very time consuming, and on top of it, as I went to transfer all my newly converted files, I found that InnoTab was no longer recognizing the files I placed on the SD card.
I was using the same method I had when we first received it so there had to be some undercover update that changed this process.
I could find NO way to transfer the files.
Even considering the comment about making sure the SD card is not locked did nothing.
So, I pulled out my iPod, queued up the video files to be converted and got some sleep.
"I got this through Amazon Vine to review and gave it to my 5 year old son to play with.
He thought it was great...for about a week and then was bored with it.
Then he got aLeapFrog LeapPadand since then he hasn't touched this one at all.The InnoTab is definitely not superior to theLeapFrog LeapPad; it feels a lot cheaper and is a lot cheaper.
There were a couple things though with its construction that are very annoying.
First of all the battery cover falls off constantly even during normal use.
Very obnoxious and a chocking hazard for younger kids.
Also the pen that comes with it is not attached to the InnoTab and is incredible easy to loose.
The Innotab is big and clunky and just feels cheap.Okay so the hardware is mediocre but what about the software.
The games and apps are okay.
You get to choose a couple free apps right away.
My son chose a Penguin Slide game and really loved it...for a couple days.
He pretty much finished the whole game at all difficulties very quickly and then got bored.
This followed for the other games we bought for it.
They are all very short and fairly easy, not very high quality from a graphic or development aspect.
Keep in mind they are also much cheaper than the LeapPad Apps ($2.99 versus $7.99 or more).The Innotab does have a camera; it is an okay camera.
You can look at the pictures you take; but (unlike the LeapPad) you can't import the pics into the drawing App and color on the pictures you take.
I encourage parents to thoroughly research both the Vtech InnoTab and the LeapFrog Leappad before making their purchase.
Each device has pros and cons, but you also need to keep in mind the age of your child and what they are used to as far as hand-held devices (if any).
If your child is used to playing certain apps on your high-tech iPad, or on your computer, then they may likely find these devices geared towards kids rather disappointing.My 4 year old has been allowed to play some simple pre-school games on both our tablet and the computer, but was still very excited to recieve her own tablet with her own games and fun features.
While the price for the InnoTab downloadable games is fantastic (compared to LeapFrog), the games themselves aren't that fantastic, and they do not keep track of and ajust to your child's level of learning for each game.While the Innotab is built fairly well and so far has endured drops and bumps and even being sat on - the LeapFrog Leappad just feels and looks better, it feels more solid in your hands.
While I do like the little kick-stand on the back of the InnoTab I foresee this being easily broken in the near future.A big dislike is the inability to delete pre-loaded content on the InnoTab - why would you want to keep and look at pictures and video that aren't yours?
Seems like a silly little issue, but at the same time drives me nuts.Our biggest like about the InnoTab is it's ability to play music and movies, unlike the Leappad, although movies do have to be uploaded in a particular format.
Also you can use a bigger memory card with the InnoTab than with the LeapPad, so you are able to upload more than just a couple of movies and songs.While my daughter really likes the music and movies that the InnoTab provides, she prefers the games and books that are on the Leappad tablet better - if we had to choose just one it would be a tough choice.
Over time the games and books for InnoTab may improve, and the pricing and options for Leappad may as well, it's hard to say.If you're not planning on surprising your child with one of these I highly recommend finding a store that has one on display so your child can touch and try them, and hopefully make your purchasing choice a little easier.
After spending time with the device and watching my kid with it I think that it is just an overall OK device.It is hard on batteries but you don't seem to get any performance benefits from that.
The device seems to be under powered in the processing department, things take a while to load, some games and apps don't respond to input well, it just feels laggy.
I think the same of the competition as well but I still think they are slightly better in the performance department.
The device also looses a few points in my book for lacking a tether for the stylus and having no camera.I do like the fact that you can use your own SD card so props there.
I also haven't had a problem with the durability or functionality of the device.
My kid has spent quite a bit of time using it and everything is still intact and working fine.
The screen seems to have held up well, I only see a few fine light scratches in it, and it hasn't been treated like a precious item.
I can't say I know where the stylus is though.As for the content my kid likes the books.
Words are read and highlighted, you can touch a word and have it read, and some words have definitions that pop up and are read to you.
The words are spoken clearly and easy to understand from what I have heard.
The unit also has the expected built in apps to draw, listen to music, watch videos, take notes, calendar, etc.I had no problem connecting the device to my PC to download updates and purchase content.
Keep in mind you have to supply the SD card.I would say if you find a very good deal on the device give it a shot if you think your child will enjoy it.
You still need to purchase a SD card for downloading apps and with the devices limitations they should really lower the price.
Do your kids love to play with your PC, Tablet, or Touchpad devices?
If so then they will love the VTech InnoTab, and you will love the Educational and the bonus Technology features that allow you to customize the InnoTab into your child's ultimate PC/Tablet.
The Innotab comes with a high quality 5 inch Touch Screen, 8 learning applications already preloaded, a built in stand which allows you to use the tablet as a Digital Picture Frame or just a comfortable way to play games.
It also features a MP3 player, a KidiZoom Camera compatible Video Player, and the option to add additional memory with an SD card as well as play VTECH InnoTab Cartridge games.The Innotab is extremely kid friendly, built into a sturdy heavy duty child friendly case.
It comes with a thick stylus pen, and a Children's Organizer that allows your child to have a calender and keep track of important events.The InnoTab Learning Applications, E-Books and more are $4.99 each to download from the VTech website.
This is great because the competitors tablet games are on average $10-25 per download which makes the InnoTab a very affordable option.
In comparison the only feature that the Innotab doesn't have is a built in Camera.I have both the Innotab and the other popular children's tablet.
My 4 year old gets a lot of benefit from using both but I must say I personally prefer the Innotab because it is the closest thing to a popular adult name-brand tablet and a great educational tool.
"I a house where my 4 1\2 year old has been begging for time on our iPods and iPhone, I was searching for something techie, FUN, has same ideas as the Apple products but would not as easily break or break the bank.
Afteral,l it is for a 4 year old.After reading a  few reviews I was skeptical my 4 year old would transition easy to this after getting to put time in on the Ipods touches.
I am so happy he has thoroughly LOVED his Innotab, he will say he loves it so much and did not even ask for it.
And I mean LOVE it!!
WE bought him 2 games, cars 2 and Madagascar and he plays those as much as the In-tablet stuff.
We have not even downloaded the 3 free choices OR added stuff with the SD card yet and he is going strong.
He takes this EVERYWHERE and plays with it everyday!YES the batteries go fast, since we are not playing movies yet we do get a few days out of each battery change, but looking for rechargeables will be in our future!I feel this is very well made for the age group, I would not hesitate recommending it to anyone.I do think the touch screen is a bit ""tough""  not as sensitive as the apple screens as well as the ""tilt sensors"" but it does not bother my son, he has adapted to it with no issues.
And come on it retails for under $100 and is a child's tablet it was WELL worth that money.
(anyone who pays 3rd party markups has NOTHING to bitch about you made your choice yourself.
)He sits it up on the built in stand all the time and we have had no concerns, he even carries it by the stand."
