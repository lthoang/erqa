Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
This is a classic game that I used to play all the time as a child, but I hadn't played it for ages.
I was excited to find this new bright colored game with the same classic rules.
Now my children and family can enjoy it with me.
I don't know if I need to explain how to play this game, but one-sentence summary is to figure out who was murdered, where did the murder take place and what weapon was used by taking notes of the players talking.
Those three elements are randomly selected and placed separately in a confidential &#34;case file.&#34; The gameplay, suspects, weapons and rooms are the same.
It fees like a &#34;classic&#34; set of a classic game.Looking back, it's funny that kids are asked to uncover a murder in a game.
As a kid, it didn't occur to me that murders happen in real life, yet we all played this game as if murders were no big deals and had fun discussing murder methods.
Sort of like realizing how violent the content of Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote cartoons were.
Who knew kiddy stuff was so cruel?
Still, it's all fun and games for kids.
Thankfully.
As a big fan of Family Game Night, I was thrilled to get Classic Clue.
The artwork is cool, well it is classic, and for me nostalgic.
This is a nice looking board game with the original art work (not modern flashy characters).For those of you who need a refresher on how to play:  The board is Mr. Boddy's mansion and is split into nine rooms (i.e.
library, lounge, etc).
The premise is to figure out WHO killed Mrs. Boddy, WHICH WEAPON was used and in WHICH ROOM.
It's a game of deduction.
Each player is given a Detective Notepad (keep your answers private) and while playing you figure out the three questions as you check off which person, weapon, and room it did NOT happen in.What makes it more complicated, and for children over 8, is you make suggestions about who, what and where, in order to find out what other players know.
To win the game, you must make an accusation - and if you are wrong, you are out of the game.
So the child must understand the difference between SUGGESTING and ACCUSING.I enjoy the game, and a bonus is my son who is 11 with Asperger's is learning how to bluff, reason, deduce, and read social cues.
Classic game = classic fun.
**Must have three players to play along with directions.
There are some small pieces that could be choking hazards.
And you can order more detective notepads if needed.
It's been years since I've played this game, and now I'm not sure why.
It's a great game to teach children how to reason and ask questions that get them to the answers, with just the right amount of strategy thrown in.I hate games like LIFE .
.
.
all luck, no skill.
I lean towards games like SCRABBLE and MONOPOLY.
For some reason I thought this fit in the former category, but was pleasantly surprised.Great for all ages, 6 or 7 and up.
Fast paced game that doesn't take hours to play.
Highly Recommended.
"""Clue"" is a classic game that is perfect for a family game night.
The only drawback is you really need to have at least three players for the game to be fun.
Players choose a token representing one of the characters and move around the board, using their detective skills to deduce who killed Mr. Boddy, in what room of the mansion, and with what weapon.
The game says it's good for ages 8 and up and I think that is accurate.This version has the same rooms as the version I remember playing in the 70s.
The graphics of the room and the characters are different.
I assume they date back to a version earlier than the one I remember in which the characters on the cards resembled photographs instead of drawings as in this classic version.
The ""weapons"" are larger than the ones I remember from the 1970s version of the game and the rope is metal instead of the white plastic of some of the other versions.
I was disappointed, but not shocked, that the colored tokens are plastic instead of the slightly larger, wooden pawns I remember from the older games.I have to admit, my family always enjoyed playingSimpsons Clue, so it's been a while since I have played the original game.
It was nice playing the original with Miss Scarlett, Professor Plum, and all the old favorites in this fun, classic game."
Every house has board games and of those board games there are simple staples in which you should have in your collection.
Monopoly, Scrabble, Life, and of course Clue.
I had to get this board game if I wanted my children to have a normal childhood.
Clue is a fun challenging strategy game that my family enjoys.
"This is one of those games that every family has to own, right?
I remember playing this as a kid, and this is pretty much the game that I remember.
One of the problems when manufacturers update classic games is that they lose some of the emotional nostalgia pop that adults get from playing them--even though the gameplay may be the same, you just know something is off.
You feel like what beboppers called a ""moldy fig"" when you even think about complaining so you keep your mouth shut, but it's just not the same.This ""Classic Edition"" avoids that problem by presenting CLUE as you remember it.
It's just a fun game, and this is a wonderful presentation of it.
Your game shelf could do a lot worse than having this one on it."
My husband and I really enjoyed this game.
We had not played in years.
It was too funny to see the look on his face when I won.
I can hardly wait until the next game night:)
Clue is a board game that has stood the test of time.
This &#34;classic edition&#34; is the game as it was a couple of decades ago (a few new bits have been added since).
If you grew up playing Clue, this will be the game you remember.
"I used to play this with my family as a kid...  Just got this one to play with my own family and kids.
While I can't say if the ""Classic Edition"" is somehow better or worse than anything more newfangled, what I can say is that this game is just like I remember...and still fun!While younger kids may take a little while to warm up to strategies (and eliminating elements to discover the person/weapon/room) rather than discovering it, I think that also makes a game like this have a little bonus:  while not outwardly education, it certainly gets people thinking about how they're going to win.
Learning to be strategic is important.Overall...great game (and edition); I'd highly recommend this!"
If there was one board game I could play every night, every day of my life, Clue would be it.
It's the classic 'who dun it' game.
When I saw the new releases of Clue with a 'new and improved' game and characters, I was disappointed.
Why change anything on a game that was already perfect?This release of Clue is classic Clue.
No new characters and no new rooms or weapons, which is a good thing.
I am amazed at the sizes of the pieces, which are much larger than I'm used to.
The cards have some cool, retro graphics on them that I really like.If you haven't played Clue, you'll want to.
It is always entertaining and full of family fun.
Clue is one of those games that everyone knows and wants to play.
Was it Ms. Scarlett in the dining room?
It's a fun game that the whole family can enjoy but it can get a bit boring if you play it too much.
And you really need to play with a lot of people for it to be really fun!
This 'classic Clue' is a board game with deduction strategy.
There are 9 rooms, 6 suspects and 6 weapons in a mansion (essentially represented by cards).
Three cards - one from each category - representing the room, suspect and weapon involved in the murder are secretly placed in the case folder and the rest of the cards are equally distributed amongst the 3-6 players required to play the game.
Players roll the dice and move their pawns to different rooms in the mansion.
When they reach a room they can 'suggest' a crime scenario based on the cards in their possession.
The other players starting from the next player can one by one disprove the suggestion (e.g.
if the next player has either the room/suspect/weapon card in their hand) or pass it to the next player.
When a suggestion is disproved, only the player who suggested learns why it was disproved (which of room/suspect/weapon was not right?).
So it is important to pay attention to which scenarios are suggested and disproved even when it is not your turn.
All players carefully take notes to eliminate rooms/suspects/weapons.
When a player is ertain of the murder scenario, that person can present an accusation and secretly look at the case folder.
If he/she is right, that player wins.
If not, that player places the cards back in to the case folder and cannot make any more suggestions, but he/she continues to play disproving other players suggestions based on cards in their possession.
There are some additional rules about player movement too.It's really a fun game and very easy to explain.
The recommended age is 8+ which I think is appropriate with the set of kids we played with.
While explaining the rules, I suggest playing the first couple of rounds with cards open/visible to all players.
Who cannot like a classic board game like CLUE?
I know that I've have been playing it for over 30 years and introduced it to my kids.
What I like about this classic edition; is that it is not themed with some pop culture product.
It is fashioned after the original game from the forties (certainly looks different from the edition I had).
The game is the same; what suspect; what weapon and in what room.
The weapons are metal and big (I like that), the playing pieces are cheap plastic pieces you could find in any travel game (they could have done better), the board is sturdy and the cards have retro artwork.
For the SRP, it is worth all the fun the family will have.
My kids have really enjoyed this game.
Just as I remembered it growing up.
lots of fun for the family.
Age rating is appropriate.
I would recommend this game for a family.
The game is long for younger ones.
The instruction is clear and they found it fun if you enjoy mysteries.
It is a bit challenging for 9 year old.
"I remember playing ""Clue"" as a child with my cousins at their house.
It was a very fun and challenging game back then and it still is to this day.
When offered this game through the Vine program, I jumped at the chance to once again blame Colonel Mustard of being the murderer in the kitchen with the candlestick.Almost thirty years later, I was surprised to see that my daughter loves this game.
She enjoys using her brain to deduce who is the murderer, where it was committed, and what the weapon of choice happened to be.
She begged me to immediately play the game when it arrived at our house.
""Clue"" is one classic that I believe will never die.
It makes you work to win the game, and can be played over and over with little chance of ever becoming boring.
It's one of those things that is so much fun and so challenging, that it can trump a video game, and that is rare these days.Highly recommended for its nostalgic value, but also for its challenge."
Clue was a childhood favorite game and I had forgotten just how fun it could be.
We have a lot of the classics at home (LIFE, Sorry, etc) but for some reason Clue had been forgotten.We are a game loving family and often have one or two set up for spontaneous game nights.
We played last night for the first time and my 14 year old son loved it.
It was amazing that he had never played it at friends house.
We actually played 3 games before we were finished.
I rated this game educational because it really does a great job teaching kids analytical skills and deduction skills and on top of that it is a whole lot of fun.If your family, like mine, has forgotten about CLUE, now is the time to get it for the holidays.
"Clue the Classic Edition has a sophistication that is missing from many modern versions.
The rooms are neat and uncluttered, the weapons are weighty and durable.
There's a manilla ""confidential"" folder that conceals the culprit, weapon and room where the incident occurred.
With each detective list being good for 10 games, there's plenty to fill (you can easily copy more).
The board is attractive and shiny-it's of average durability along with the cards, character markers and die.The directions are fairly simple, though I did need my son to help me understand a couple aspects of the gameplay.
Note: get complete understanding BEFORE you play.
I only lost our first game because I didn't realize I could make an ""accusation"" immediately after no one could disprove my ""suggestion.
""I appreciate that these directions begin with specifying that this is a pretend case of ""foul play"" with fictitious characters, just like in a stage play-a comforting thought considering this is a family game.Result of our family's first experience playing Clue: WE HAD A BLAST!
I was surprised to discover that there is more to this game than simply asking questions and writing down deductions.
There are elements of: psychology, reasoning, subterfuge, stealth...Finally, a mystery game I can enjoy with the kids.If you're looking for an amazingly well-crafted Clue game, you could tryClue Luxury Editionfor hundreds of dollars.
At less than $20, this game is perfect for our family.
I'm glad Hasbro has brought back such a wonderful game at an affordable price.
Highly recommended!"
I remember this game being boring when I was younger, but my siblings cheated.
A lot.
I think that had a lot to do with my lackluster experience.
Fast forward several years to me playing it with my kids, total win.
Not the boring experience I had!
They enjoy it, it's not terribly long, and anyone can win... if you figure out the clues.
Glad that it's held up so well, because it is indeed a worthy classic!
I love how Winning Moves Games is coming out with all of these 'classic' editions of long-time family favorite games such as Clue, Yahtzee, and Sorry.
They were great games when they first came out years ago, and now I'm excited to introduce them to my 5-year old and make them part of our family.This edition of Clue has a retro-look to it, from the box to the game board and the cards.
The weapons pieces are all metal and much bigger then I remember them being (was the revolver always this huge?).
When I was a kid this was my favorite game to play, and now I'm eager to introduce my daughter to it.
We play as a team since she is just learning how to read, and she is still mastering the art of deduction (heck, so am I!).
The game is definitely more interesting if you have at least 4 people playing, and just as much fun as I remembered it being.Highly recommended for some good old-fashioned family game-night fun, it would even make a great gift for somebody who remembers playing as a child but hasn't played in a long time.
This is classic Clue just the way you remember it including Colonel Mustard and Miss Scarlett.
The character tokens are made of wood and the weapons are metal.
The graphics on the board and the cards are retro, harkening back to the original version.
Terrific family game.
Clue is a great starter game to get your game night going.
Kids love this game and it's a good way to learn deductive reasoning.
If your version is getting old and tattered, this makes the perfect replacement at a great price.
If you're into family game nights with board games and you haven't added Clue to your collection, then here's your chance.
"Clue is one of those transcendent games that's maintained it's viability for over 50 years.
Why?
It still feels fresh and is flat-out fun to play.Here's a quick synopsis for the unfamiliar:  There's been a murder at the mansion and you're a character in a race to figure out who did it, what weapon they used, and which room the murder occurred in.
Be the first to get your accusation right and you win the game.The suspect, weapon, and room combo changes every game through a brilliantly simple process involving cards and a CONFIDENTIAL case file envelope.
It takes about 5 minutes to set up and usually between 20 - 40 minutes to play.
Clue can be played with as few as 2 people, but 3 - 6 is ideal as it adds layers to uncovering clues (without increasing the complexity).
The game states it's appropriate for ages 8 and up, and my 8-year-old understands the concepts well enough to have lots of fun and often be competitive (if I leave my cut-throat self at the door).
The learning curve for this game is really quick, especially if you have a seasoned player helping explain the rules.
If not, don't worry.
You'll be solving murders in no time.The ""Classic Edition"" bills itself as having the ""Original Suspects, Rooms, & Weapons"".
(There have been a few updated editions released that included extra weapons and rooms.)
If you grew up on Clue or are familiar with editions released prior to 1990, this will very likely be the format you're familiar with.
The character pawns are stained wood and all weapons are metallic.
The only difference I detected from my 1980s edition was the artwork on the cards.
It looks as though the manufacturer resurrected the original 1949 artwork as well, giving the game a very classic, whodunit-y feel.
All in all, the stellar gameplay remains the same.In addition to rating fun and durability at 5-stars, I gave Clue's educational value a 4-star rating.
My sister and I played hours upon hours of this game growing up... and to this day, with us both in our thirties - it still hasn't lost it's charm.
This is the original layout of the mansion, the cards go in the secret envelope in the center.
The weapons are made of metal and the characters are painted wood.
The rules and premise are the same as you remember from your childhood.
The only difference between this and the version we grew up with is that the artwork is most likely from a much older (probably original) edition.This is a fabulous version of this game that you can spend countless hours playing with your children.
And I do believe that it is educational - in that it teaches children about deduction and some basic logic.
Even if there was no educational value I would still play this game for the joy of it.If you haven't played the game, each person is a character in the mansion.
A murder has been committed and by deduction you have to figure out which room it was in, which weapon was used and which of the characters was the guilty party.
You do this by writing down your guesses and by process of elimination determining which of each it was.I highly recommend this throwback version of the game.
"This version of Clue is produced under license from Hasbro by Winning Moves Games, a company that has introduced numerous classic games such as Yahtzee and Monopoly in retro versions.
The main difference between the various editions of Clue available right now is the board layout and character replacements (e.g., the Simpsons or Seinfeld).
I like this classic layout, though game play is not substantially different from one version to the next.
I find the build quality uneven.
The weapons are nicely made of metal and the board is good.
The ""pawns"" (the people) are plastic, and the box itself is thin cardboard that I expect to rip over time.
I would have preferred a box that can take a beating from kids.
Still, at an MSRP of 19.99, this set comes out as one of the better made versions of Clue.
There is a less expensive one from Hasbro but I don't recommend it."
