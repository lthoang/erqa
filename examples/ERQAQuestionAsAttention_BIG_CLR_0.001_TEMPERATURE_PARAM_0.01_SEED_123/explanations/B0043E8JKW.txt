Reviews:
This is a well made product that turned out to be a cool nerf gun, but it ultimately ends up costing too much.
Requiring 6 C Batteries is just too much for a gun that will have such heavy use, and the replacement darts are about 50 cents apiece too.
After playing with this a couple of weeks, you will likely have to replace the batteries and buy another bag of 10 darts, a total of a $15 investment.
I would rather use a nerf gun that does not require batteries, like theNerf Rapid Fire 20.If this is what you are looking for and the batteries don't bother you, then buy this product and you will be very happy.
For everyone else, find something like the Rapidfire that uses human power instead of battery power.
"Two boys, aged 5 and 7, LOVED this thing.
It's a giant foam dart gun, with darts that have little mini-velcro tips so it will stick to things like carpet or towels.
It's LOUD - the gun firing and moving is pretty loud so it overpowers any noise/whistling you are supposed to get from the foam darts whizzing by (this page says the darts whistle, but I never heard it).
It's kind of front-heavy, but the boys had no problems with it.
We did target practice off a towel, or into a box.
Or maybe me wearing a towel and goggles while holding a ""shield""?
HA!
They really did enjoy this thing.
It was a lot of fun.
I don't know about a real game playing with other people wearing the legit armor that these darts stick to, but as a toy for 2 boys to mess around with, we easily spent an hour or more playing with it.
Educational value actually did exist, as I would have the boys count up and add up the darts that stuck from round to round.
But other than that, it's just really fun to use!"
This is a great toy but my son is only 5 and it was a little too much power for him.
I think we will have put this one in the closet until he is a bit older.
When my cousins said they were coming to visit I panicked because they have four little boys and I am a single man with no children of my own.
How would I ever entertain them?
Alas, enter Nerf Dart Tag Swarmfire.
After taking a few minutes to read the instructions, insert the batteries and go over a few basic rules I let them have at it.The four of them all shared the one gun, took turns with it, and had the best time ever raising a ruckus in my backyard.
I was so thankful that I was able to share this wonderful toy with them, because we all had a hoot watching them play.The only downside I could determine was that the batteries seemed to weaken fairly quickly.
Also, it was a bit heavy for the 7-year-old, but the package said it is suitable for children 8+, so I guess that would be expected for smaller children.
Other than that, I would say the Nerf Dart Tag Swarmfire was an overwhelming success.
The kids were content and entertained and we adults were able to visit and catch up on all the family gossip.
I highly recommend this Nerf product.
My kids were glad to give this gun a try.
First, this thing is BIG.
It's a little unwieldy, but it does perform!
You can press the trigger slowly for one at a time bullets or hold down the trigger to expel all 20 bullets at once in rapid fire.
It's easy to load and it comes with all the bullets you need.
There are other nerf guns my kids prefer but this one is pretty good.
I like it because there's not a lot of complicated parts to lose.What you see is what you get.
