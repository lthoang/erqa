Top question(s):
The first beam box system we had only worked for a short time - the image on the screen flashed the entire time. Then, when we tried it again later, it wouldn't work at all. Sometimes you could hear Optimus Prime's voice for a split second as it was loading -- then nothing happens. We exchanged the beam box for a new one thinking that it was just a problem with that one toy. But the second one we got doesn't respond either. We even called the 800# help line, but they didn't have an answer - offered to replace it for us and sent us a prepaid label to ship it to them. My question is, has anyone else had similar issues... flashing image, hearing character voice, but no image or nothing happening at all? We've tried it on 3 different tv's so that can be ruled out as the issue. Thanks!
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Top sentence(s):
The graphics are reminiscent of Atari but not as antiquated.
The concept is a really neat idea because the boys want to play with the Optimus Prime figure anyway.
I gave this to a 5 year old who I would describe as being intelligent but enjoying age appropriate games and activities.
With the little action figures, the younger kid wanted to play with the figure and subsequently misplaced it at times.
)Cons:I think any child under about 5 would struggle to understand this game but any child much past 7 will get bored even faster than my 7 year old grandson got bored.

Questions:
Does this come with any bots?
Can more than one person play this at the same time?
What size batteries does it take, how many, and are they included?
Can this be hooked up to a computer?
The first beam box system we had only worked for a short time - the image on the screen flashed the entire time. Then, when we tried it again later, it wouldn't work at all. Sometimes you could hear Optimus Prime's voice for a split second as it was loading -- then nothing happens. We exchanged the beam box for a new one thinking that it was just a problem with that one toy. But the second one we got doesn't respond either. We even called the 800# help line, but they didn't have an answer - offered to replace it for us and sent us a prepaid label to ship it to them. My question is, has anyone else had similar issues... flashing image, hearing character voice, but no image or nothing happening at all? We've tried it on 3 different tv's so that can be ruled out as the issue. Thanks!
We need to replace the controller (long story) is that doable?
What channel should the tv be on?
Where is Chase?
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
There is a reason this is stated for ages 3 and up.
Your pre-teens would not be interested.
My son is 9 and a big Transformers fan but once he got this he played for a few minutes and gave up.
The graphics aren't up to par to what he plays on his xbox 360 and maybe he is spoiled that way.
We also had issues with the controller so this worked when it felt like it.For the price that it is now I still wouldn't buy it!
Installation: This game is very easy to install, you just put in the batteries, and attach it to your TV, and that&#8217;s it.
I must say that I was very impressed.Batteries: OK, I was less impressed with the fact that the Box is powered by 4 AA batteries.
You can&#8217;t take this game and play it on the road; it must be hooked up to a TV, which inevitably must be plugged in.
I just did not get that about this system.
I am not a big fan of battery-eating toys.Play: My three year old got a big kick out of putting Optimus Prime into the Box and beaming him into the game &#8211; it is a fun gimmick.
He enjoyed the game itself, which he found challenging, but playable.
The controller is just the right size for little hands.I noticed that the graphics of the game are fairly primitive, having the feel of a 1980s game, right down to the repetitiveness of the play.Conclusion: This is a nice game for 3-5 year-olds &#8211; they are sure to find it fun and very playable.
Kids older than that, though, are likely to expect much more out of their games, and likely will not enjoy it.
(Review of Playskool Heroes Transformers Rescue Bots Beam Box Game System)
This is a very basic gaming system.
The graphics are reminiscent of Atari but not as antiquated.
The system is easy to install.
It plugs into the TV and is ready for use.
The action figure is placed into the turn style, press the button and the child is ready to play.
The remote control is chunky and easy for the 6 and younger crowd to maneuver.
The games are easy to play.
(a maze, break the asteroid, driving, and others).
The games are fun and a good introduction to the gaming world.
The graphics aren't on the same scale as a Wii or iPad games, but enjoyable nonetheless.
When you consider the price for this entire system is less than many of the accessories for other controllers, you realize what a great value this is.
Kids who love these characters will enjoy the video games in the extremely simple to use system.
No, the graphics aren't quite what you get in the $400 systems, but they are fine, especially for the little ones who will be playing them.
Can give the kids hours of entertainment.
Also, quite portable compared to the other systems, which makes it great for when you are traveling.
A good start to video games for a little kid.
would recommend.
My kids are accustomed to high-quality modern graphics.
To our astonishment, this game uses graphics equivalent to what I imagine was available in the 80s.There was just no way to get my kids interested in the game once they saw the rudimentary graphics on their TV.
The graphics use big squares so the resolution is not as good as anything I've seen in many years.This is my honest review.
Don't accept this toy even if it is offered for free.
I have always been a fan of transformers - dating all the way back to Generation 1 and my childhood days.
The Heroes Rescue Bot Beam Box combines Transformers with a novel gaming system.
The Beam Box is a fun concept, but it will likely be a little to basic of a game to hold the interest of children over the age of 6.Notes- Comes with an Optimus Prime figure that can be used to play 5 games- The Beam Box requires 4 AA batters and the controller needs 2 AAA batteries.- The controller requires a direct line of sight in order to work- The games are very basic ..... the controls are a bit shoddy and can be a bit non-responsive.
The games are ok, but on par with a low end app for an iphone.- The best part is the novelty of the Beam Box - but after a few days it may be forgotten, especially by ypunger children.Final Verdict - Will provide entertainment for children and younger Transformers fans.
The concept is pretty cool, and everyone likes how Optimus Prime *Disappears* However the game is pretty basic and is on par with a low end app.3 1/2 Stars
My boy just turned 5 and he's definitely had fun with this toy, but I wouldn't call the navigation overly intuitive, nor are the objectives of the games.
He got there eventually but it wasn't without some initial frustration.
I'm not wild about how many batteries this takes and would prefer if the unit drew its power from the TV (they can do that, can't they?)
even if it meant the price tag were higher.Overall, definitely a cute toy especially at the new super-low price.
I have two boys, ages 6 and 8 and both are huge Transformers fan.
My youngest had seen the commercials of the Transformers Rescue Bots Beam Box on TV already and had been begging for it.
They were so stoked to see Mom had gotten them Optimus Prime Beam Box.
I received it free from BzzAgent.To get started, you'll need 4 AA batteries for the console and 2 AAA batteries for the controller.
The set is composed of 3 parts: the controller, the console and Optimus Prime figure.My boys have a Wii and love playing video games so they were so excited to try this out.
The concept is a really neat idea because the boys want to play with the Optimus Prime figure anyway.
I can see that being a problem though because if they misplace Optimus then they aren't going to be able to play with the video game.After installing the batteries, set-up is quick and easy.
The kids can set it up themselves which is always nice for Mom.They really liked it and found it easy to navigate through the games.
This unit blends the Skylanders concept with the type of mini-game that you'd find for free on a website.
The games are short, relatively easy but on the upside are reasonably well animated and does use Optimus Prime's voice from the movies and Rescue Bots TV show.This system is decidely geared to the younger set and can be fun for a bit but realize that the quality of the games while nice looking are on par with something you'd play for free on the web.Note: The wireless controller works using an infrared beam, just like your TV remote.
Therefore you need a clean line of sight between the base unit and the wireless controller.
So no hiding this in a cabinet after plugging it in.
This Beam Box Game System might be nice for smaller children who aren't really experienced at holding game controllers or whose hands are not big enough to hold regular controllers.
It has two large buttons on a very small controller.The controller needs to be pointed at the beam box once the beam box is plugged in to the television through the yellow and white AV cable.
Then you push down on the big button on top to start it.
The character disappears into the rotating door and the game shows up on the television.The first level on the first game pretty much involved driving a truck in a straight line except to miss the blockades in the road.
There are five separate games, none of which were very difficult.
This does not have the sophistication or complexity of the Atari games.This game was abandoned once the novelty of a transformers beam box was worn out.
Pros:Set up easilyEasy to understand game play for the appropriate age (see below.
)Cons:I think any child under about 5 would struggle to understand this game but any child much past 7 will get bored even faster than my 7 year old grandson got bored.
At best, it's suitable for maybe 5 - 8 year old.Game play is very repetitive.Offers very little actual challenge.Graphics are very basic.In short, if your child has access to a Wii or other higher end system, you're going to find this is a waste of money.
If not, I suspect you'll still discover it has very limited play value.I don't recommend it.
Amazon shipped fast, arrived on time, undamaged, good job Amazon.
Yep, this is kinda old school.
It uses basic audio and video so don't expect Xbox graphics.
With that being said, this is a pretty cool little setup.
Yep, its skylanders, disney infinity on a budget.
But for twenty bucks, you got a time killer for your kids.
I asked my son what he thought and he said it was fun.
He said he likes it, and that is why it gets 4 stars, since 4 stars says &#34;I like it&#34;.
The quality is questionable so who knows how long it will last.
For a twenty spot, it would be a nice birthday present for a transformer fan.
The proverbial 'but' is the price, graphics, and overall concept when console systems like Wii and Xbox serve this purpose.
With that said my 5 and 6 year old boys still loved it - mainly because it was a new toy to play.
They love their video games and Transformers to boot so this was a no-brainer they would enjoy.
If this were a $15-$20 game, I'd say pull the trigger but not at 40 beans.
Frustrated with your kids playing Angry Birds on your iPhone?
Don't want sticky little fingers playing with your PS4?
Playskools Heroes Transformers Rescue Bots is a good &#34;kidstation&#34; where the games aren't too difficult to play, the action figure to tv imagination element is great, and the portability is good (no power cords - great!
Let's play in the car or bring on a trip, kiddies).
That said, what makes this unit great is also what is it's downfall.
With simpler games, the older kid didn't care for it.
It was too easy for him and he plowed through the game for the most part.
The animation wasn't terribly appealing to him either since he's used to seeing images such as Mario 3D or Lego Avengers and the like.
With the little action figures, the younger kid wanted to play with the figure and subsequently misplaced it at times.
Kinda of a damper when you want to play the game.
Lastly, because the unit runs of AA batteries, the play time is greatly limited and you will be buying more batteries whether you like it or not.
Thank goodness for rechargeable batteries!All those things aside, my younger kid really liked this system.
It's like Skylanders, but cheaper (in an okay way).
My kids found this system fun, but keeping that in mind, this thing will have a shelf life that expires much much faster than a Wii.
If you're looking for a short term gaming system, this isn't too bad.
Along the lines of the Skylander games, this game system appears to transport characters from their physical toy form into the virtual world inside your television.
Kids are mesmerized by this concept, as are some adults actually.
It is kind of cool!
At any rate... this game system is intended for younger kids anywhere from pre-K to about second or third grade level.
The game includes one character Optimus Prime, additional characters may be purchased separately and are reasonably priced.
It's nice to have a game that's all-inclusive rather than part of a game console that is much more expensive.
It hooks up to your television with a simple A/V cable (included) and really once you get it out of the box, the kids can do the rest!
It's not all the high tech and fancy graphics that so many of the games out there consist of and I think that's what makes it just right for the intended age range.
I gave this to a 5 year old who I would describe as being intelligent but enjoying age appropriate games and activities.
He thought this game was &#34;babyish&#34; and didn't enjoy it at all.
The gaming systems kids have now, including the ones they play on their parents phones are so much better in terms of graphics, playability, etc.
I don't see a niche where this game would perform well.I also think having it run on batteries is a big ZERO stars.Lastly, I'd call this a $15-20 toy at most.
This is a fun little toy that plugs directly into the TV with relative ease.
The 6 year-old boy enjoyed sending Optimus Prime into the game to run around (he also loves Skylanders) but he did find some of the game play difficult and needed assistance.
We found this to be a great first game system aimed at younger children who are eager about video game playing, but are too young to catch on to the more elaborate systems.
It is not only is easy to use and set up for a young child but also fun, entertaining and a great introduction to those other platforms for when they get older.If your child really loves the Rescue Bots, they would definitely like this game system.
There is just one button and a joystick.
Perfect for the Preschool ages!
It includes 5 games.
If you purchase the add-on packs, it only adds one additional game, but allows you to play as that character in the 5 built-in games.
"My son had actually come running to me with an ad for this toy, so I was pretty sure he would like it.
And boy, was I right!
He's four, the perfect age for this game system (recommended age 3-7), and loves Rescue Bots.
The kid has run into my room every morning since we got it, begging to play.
He's not quite totally forgotten about the iPad, but close.Whoever decided to make the game cartridges for this system in the shape of Transformers was BRILLIANT.
My son carefully took Optimus Prime out of the game system and brought him to dinner with us.
Putting the figurine into the base and pushing the button then ""beams"" Optimus Prime into the virtual game system...  but my little man figured out within minutes that he was really just hidden in the back of the machine.
Still, it's a fun gimmick.The controller is the perfect size for young hands, and even though he has never held a game controller before in his life, after a small learning curve, he is now moving everything around like a pro.
That said, the game controller uses IR like a remote control, so you have to be reasonably close to the base, have the controller pointed in the right direction, and not have anything (like a finger) blocking the two.The game system shuts off automatically after a fairly short timeout: you have to turn it off, wait for a few seconds, turn it back on, and then beam Optimus back to the real world and then back again.
It's a bit of a hassle.Plus, the game system beambox is LOUD.
There are some sounds that come from the base itself when it turns on and when you ""beam"" the transformer into the game that I haven't figured out how to soften.
This is surprising, since Playskool is usually good about stuff like that.Cartridges are available in all of the Rescue Bots except Chase the Police Bot for some reason.
That sort of limits this to four or five games total.
My son doesn't quite have the dexterity to slide them in properly.There is also NO educational value to these games whatsoever, which would make me a lot happier.
This is purely a game system (as there weren't enough already out there!).
There's no USB or networking, so no way to update it should Playskool ever come up with an enhancement.
"This easy to assemble, TV video game geared, mostly for boys, I think, ages 3-7, offers simple games and rewards the participants with bronze, silver, or gold medals.
Play alone or with another.It requires 4 AA batteries(not included) for the console in which one places the Rescue Bot; two cables 7' long(audio and video) plug into the TV.
2 AAA's are needed for the controller which is like a TV remote and directs the Bot on the screen and chooses the game.Turn the console on; place the Bot inside; press down the top and off you go.
The console comes alive with lights and vocals.
The Bot ""disappears"" when the door closes and opens again, and appears on the TV.
It's dramatic and fun.There are 5 games where the Bot collects Energons(diamond-like shards) and fight off various obstacles and earn a prize.The games are fairly easy and simple in concept and expandable.
Our two daughters(7 & 10) were not that interested in it, but I think it's cute for whoever wants some mindless fun.
Best of all, it's fast to set-up and start playing.
No computers."
This game system is based on being a simple plug and.
And it truly was not hard to set up.
The game itself can be fun for a younger child  but parental help will be necessary for under 5.
The actual game has two scenes- driving and blasting bad robots.
You can see your progression of game levels via a map.
So that makes for a nice visual for a non-reader.
There are also mini games and games specific to the character in the console.
However, the actual there are a few problems that may result in many tears from the little ones this is targeted to.-the graphics are rather weak.
Not really something to cause tears, but in today's world of Internet graphics, iPads and playstations, this may  cause yawns.
However, a young child may not really care- 5 batteries are needed.
4 AA batteries for the actual console and 2 AAA batteries for the controller.I would at least expect the console to be AC powered, but nope.
I really dislike going through batteries so quickly.-You lose a Beam Box Transformer and the game is over.
There is no way to play the game.-the controller can be kind of wonky and maybe difficult to manipulate for some children.
But your millage may vary.Kind of cool:-There are more Beam Box Transformer bots available to play additional games.-The Beam Box Transformer disappearing into the console and reappearing on the game is actually pretty neat.-You can hook it up to your car DVD player since it runs on batteries-Can be fun for younger children as long as they understand how to play the game and don't allow their frustration to cause a melt down.Overall, this could be a great game for you child or it could be a big disappointment.
It really depends on their idea of what good graphics consist of, their understanding of how to play and you have lots of batteries.
