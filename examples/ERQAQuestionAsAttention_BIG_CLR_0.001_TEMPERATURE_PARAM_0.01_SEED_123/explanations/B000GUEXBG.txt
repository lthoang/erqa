One of the front wheels is not level and is actually off the ground.  Child can make it go but it's not so fast.  Is that normal?
front wheel shaft is too wide to fit into body.  what do we do?
Can it be ridden outside?
Would this work for a small 4 year old? He's about the size of a 2 year old
I am building it right now and have a spare part. The Hex Key. What do I do with this? It is not mentioned in instructions.
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
When I saw this as an option to review for Amazon, I thought my kids would get a kick out of it.
I had no idea just how much fun they would have!!
My daughter is 10 and my son is 6.
I thought my son would get more use out of this, but I have to say that they love this car equally as much.
To be honest, they fight like crazy over who gets to ride it.
I am truly and seriously considering purchasing another one so that they will each have their own.The PlasmaCar comes is a big box - the actual box, so if this is a gift, please be aware of that fact.
Once opened, the car is in a few pieces - the body, the steering wheel and the two sets of wheels.
You will need a rubber hammer or a regular hammer with a thick piece of cardboard or wood block to product the plastic while you pound.
Now, do not be afraid - the only hammering needed is to tap in the wheels and the steering column - no biggie.
These are the only steps to put together the car from start to finish.
Do be aware that you need to be sure that the steering column is in all the way otherwise the car will not work properly - it should fit in snug and not allow the user to lift the column up and down, only side to side.Using the PlasmaCar is simple and FUN!
Simply sit on the seat, grab the steering wheel and twist back and forth.
The back and forth action, along with the movement of your body will get the car going.
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how fast the car can go.
The instructions say up to 6 mph!
Pretty speedy for something like this.
"Aren't these just the coolest things?
I first saw a PlasmaCar at a pizza place/indoor playground last year.
My daughter loved them as soon as she got on, and ended up playing with the PlasmaCars more than the play structures.
The problem was that I didn't know what they were called (neither did the kids working there) and never saw them in stores.
I recently got a chance to score one of these and my daughter was thrilled to have one of her own.
This is one of those ""toys"" that should last any child for a long time.Assembly is simple.
The only tools you'll need are a rubber mallet and a Philips screwdriver.
There aren't any screws to put in, but the screwdriver is needed to tighten the nut on the steering shaft with the included socket tool.
Once everything's tested for safety, you're ready to go!
Just push along the floor and the PlasmaCar slides along any hard floor perfectly.
It manages to keep a good speed on its own for a while too.
The foot rests are a welcome addition as well- the design of this product is practically perfect.
Normally I can find faults with just about anything...but not this time.
This is a good little car, and it doesn't make much noise either!
This is also one of those things that kids will probably enjoy just sitting on while watching tv or eating a snack.The PlasmaCar is very sturdy, more than I was expecting for something in this price range.
The wheels and steering wheel aren't in any danger of breaking off unless the PlasmaCar is roughly used...or maybe driven down a flight of stairs by a curious adult.
Very cool car.
Of course my kids did not find it as fun as the Radio Flyer Ziggle, but it still a lot of fun.
My wife loves it too and tried it out.
Very few moving parts and the assembly is easy.
Only tricky part is make sure you have a rubber mallet.I wish I had this when I was a kid.
Our six year old daughter loves this little car.
She thinks it's a car from the future due to its design.
It was easy to put together, and the red is lovely.
We have ceramic tile floors in a lot of our home, so she is mostly riding it on those.
It doesn't go on the carpet well.
There was a break in period where she had to figure out how to propel it, and once she did, it was simple for her.
We did take it outside to the driveway to help mar up the plastic tires, and now it's easier for her to ride inside the house.
She parks it in the dining room, and rides it when she goes back to our bedroom, or her bedroom.
My husband (six foot four inches, 220 pounds) was also able to steer this and ride it, but not uphill (our daughter also couldn't get it to go up the incline of our driveway.)
She loves it, so we love it!
"First out of the box this car seemed easy to put together.
While it wasn't ""hard"" per se, it had it's tricky parts.
My first suggestion is to definitely have a mallet.
Some pieces need to be hammered in place and if you don't use a rubber mallet, you need to use a piece of wood to protect the car because a regular hammer can damage it.
Luckily I had a mallet.
I did manage to put the wheels on the wrong sides, but that was an easy fix.
The hex tool that came with the car didn't work at all and you need to tighten the screw in the steering wheel pretty tight.
Thankfully we had the right size tool for the job and the instruction's were correct in what you needed.
I did take off one star for assembly, but once you get it together, life is good.I tested this car with two five year old's weighing just over 30 pounds, a 7 year old weighing just over 40 pounds, me (mommy) weighing 125 pounds, and my husband weighing 140 pounds.
The car fit each of us well, although my husband looked a bit scrunched, he was still comfortable riding it.
It seems to go faster the heavier you are and the further back you sit on the seat.
However, after just a couple minutes each of the kids got the hang of it and they were able to have fun riding instead of simply creeping along.
We set up an obstacle course with some plastic cones and the kids were able to maneuver their way around the cones.
Our drive is long and wide and relatively flat and everyone was able to get and keep the car moving.This car is a ton of fun for a number of reasons.
The first is that anyone (up to 220 pounds) can ride it.
So, it's something the whole family can do and get a good lough out of it.
We have three kids, 11, 11 and 13.
They surprisingly love to scoot around on this.
Whether it's intended purpose was to scoot on the ice or not, we live in Wisconsin and the freeze over our park and the really big thrill for our kids is to play with this on the ice.This car is house safe.
Driveway and sidewalk safe and easy to use.
And unexplainably fun to use in its simplicity.
The car is lightweight but well built.
Not very hard to put together.
Packaging suffices to get it to your door with damage.
Our local target used to carry these and the one they had put together lasted several months with I am sure a lot of drive time up and down the aisle.
Good for kids in the 2-5 age range.
Smooth surfaces are a must in order for it to work.
I would guess it would work outdoors on semi smooth surfaces like a concrete driveway but I don't think the wheels would hold up long to that kind of surface.
Hardwood floors, linoleum, or finished concrete like in a garage would be best.
These are usually very well priced on Amazon as well going for well below retail.
At that price they are a good deal.
Encourages active play and coordination skills.
This Plasma Car is the perfect gift for a family!
Four of our grandkids, aged 10, 7,5,and 10 months all enjoy playing on this car.
Their house is all hardwood floors and so they can race through the entire house!
A happy circumstance, asthe car does not run on carpeting.The Plasma Car is super simple to learn to use.
The 10 yr old is autistic and physically handicapped and very easily picked up the movements needed to control the car.As a grandparent, I try to find toys that will interest the kids, and yet are really all about PLAYING.
No batteries, no video games.
This beautiful toy fits the bill perfectly!
I highly recommend it!
First off, the car arrived in a box that clearly said what it was, with pictures on the outside.
If you're ordering this for a holiday or birthday, you probably want to hide it quick when it arrives.
Set up should have been relatively simple, but somehow I managed to lock the bolt into the steering wheel without actually attaching it to the car.
I emailed the company and after describing what parts I needed to replace (and trying to pay for them), they assured me it was under warranty and a few days later the replacement parts showed up at my front door.
After carefully following the directions this time, my daughter was up and off.
When people say that you need a smooth surface, they aren't kidding.
Our driveway was expanded at one point and the car just won't go on the expansion which is slightly more rough.
The original driveway is much smoother and my daughter had no problem getting this car to go.
It also works great in our kitchen and turns on a dime.
I love how it's kid powered and requires no batteries or electricity.
She loves it and it's the first thing she plays with when she gets home from school.
Overall I give it 4 stars for the car itself (really wish it worked on more surfaces) and an extra star for great customer service.
My son came across one of these from a friend of his and really liked it.
When it showed up on Amazon, we knew we had to get it for him.
All three of my kids are able to use this.
And my 185 lb.
self has also taken it for a spin around the kitchen.
No need to use your feet; just the motion of the turning wheel/ bar puts the plasma car into motion.
It really is a wonderful experience.
Easy to use and fun to ride.
We have used ours inside the house and out.
Hard surfaces only... unless you want to scoot yourself along.
Enjoy!
"I got it for my three year old, but his two brothers ride it too, the car goes excellent on the solid surface (wood and ceramic tile), not so great on the carpet, but it is still useable there, too.
The three year old didn't figure out how to make it go, so he pushes himself forward with his feet, but his older brothers figured it out very quickly and all three of them had a lot of fun with it.
It is very maneuverable on the hard surfaces, you can make sharp turns and go backward with great speed.
Even I tried to ride, I am glad it can support an average adult (up to 220 pounds).My youngest calls it ""helicopter car"""
My son absolutely loved his plasmacar and he rode it just about everyday during decent weather.
even my 14 month old was able to get the hang of it by watching us twist it.
she wasnt great at it but it amused even her.
AFter owning this about 18 months it no longer works =( it was left outside in the wet weather and the bolts, screws, whatever is as the bottom of the steering handle and where it meets the wheels has rusted over so that we can no longer turn it.
its stuck in place.
so be aware that this should be brought under shelter during the wet season...which is almost everyday for some people lol.
So fun and super durable.
This is our second Plasma car and I can tell that these things are built really solid.
I have ridden it with both my young kids sitting and standing on it (~230 lbs total) and the thing doesn't give you any sense of failing.
We live on a decent size hill and have ridden it screaming down the black top countless times.
This is a lot fun and even more so if everyone has one so you can race.
"True to the product description, the PlasmaCar is super easy to put together.
The only real tool required is a hammer or mallet, but we even substituted that for just something heavy enough to pound two pieces together.
Total assembly time was less than five minutes.Once we got this together, everyone wanted to try it.
My 6-year-old instantly declared it ""the best toy ever!""
and, no, she hadn't seen the product description.
We have an open floor arrangement in the house, and we've kept the PlasmaCar inside, where she likes to steer it around the living room while watching TV.
My 2-year-old loves this, too.
It was total instinct for him to just get on and start steering.
He's not always adept at getting it to go where he wants it to (and he can't quite follow our directions), but he can easily get it to go (and when it doesn't go fast enough for him, he just puts his feet down and pushes, wish he seems to enjoy just as much).
The hubby tried this too, and was appropriately impressed that it really could safely and sturdily carry an adult.I can easily see why this won a Toy of the Year Award--it really is a lot of fun."
My little ones really like this there 10 and , 3 you know I like it as well--even adults can ride it of course (up to 200 pounds) you will look silly but it is fun.
It is kid powered so great excerise and no batteries or charging.
It seems very well built and sturdy I suspect we will be using this for many years to come.
We decided to wait and give this product as part of gifts for Christmas.
They were primarily for our two younger sons who are 3 and 5, however our older daughters who are 9 and 11 quickly took to them and were riding them.
They are very easy to assemble.
My father-in-law was able to get this together in no time.
(we all play Christmas elves on Christmas eve).
They will hold adult weight.
I will admit to sitting on the PlasmaCar and testing the comfort for quality assurance before Christmas morning.One bit of warning: these should be used outdoors.
We have hardwood floors on our main level and my kids took them for a spin around the house a few times before I realized the PlasmaCar was scratching up my wood floors!
So be forewarned!
"I wasn't sure if my daughter would enjoy this, she has a regular bike with trainers.
We have a large deck out back and the moment I assembled this, she played with it for hours.
I think she loves the very tactile sense of motion.
Maybe I am over thinking it.
Assembly is pretty easy but DO read the instructions.
Make sure you ""crank"" that steering wheel but on as hard as you can - as someone to help if you can't do it alone.
If the steering wheel nut isn't tight then you lose a lot of the motion.Great fun and extremely durable!!"
Plasmacars are awesome for kids and adults.
A toddler can easily ride one.
Your husband can easily ride one.
That is why you don't buy just one.
You need two of those things (at least) so you can race!
These remind me of a slightly more comfortable version of the Flying Turtle we had as kids.
They are very easy to assemble.
They also last.
We've got a couple that are 3 years old that sit out in the rain that still look like new.
I purchased the Plasmacar for my grandchildren ages 3 1/2 & 2 1/2.
I expected them to figure this out quickly, but it took a while for them to get the hang of it.
The idea is to rest your feet on the car and move the steering wheel back and forth quickly to get the car to move.
It helps to push off with your feet first.
It really wasn't as exciting for them as I thought it would be.
I was also surprised to see how slow they moved.
After a week or so, they did get faster on it, but honestly, they prefer to put their feet on the floor & ride this like a normal riding toy.
I waited over a year to buy this for them - so they'd be old enough to use it - and I wasn't overly impressed with it.
As a matter of fact, I remember getting my riding toys to move using this same motion.
Next time I visit, I'll suggest they use this on their smooth garage floor & update my review with the results.With a weight limit of 220 lbs., all of the adults tried it too.
And that's when we discovered grooves in the hardwood floor.
The little ones made grooves too; their grooves weren't as deep & we  didn't notice them right away.
I think the manual mentioned that this might happen, but I think this important information should be part of the product description.There's a video on Amazon that proves how much fun this car can be, but none of my family members got the Plasmacar moving as quickly & smoothly as the young girl in the video.
If you're interested in viewing the video, I'll post more information in the comment section of my review.It was easy to put together & using a rubber mallet as suggested definitely helps.The Plasmacar will  work best on a hard, smooth surface.
It won't work on carpet or grass.
We have a driveway with a sidewalk that slopes down to our yard.
I got on at the top of the driveway and turned the steering wheel to get my 130 lbs.
going and off I went racing down the sidewalk and into the yard.
The kids took turns next and the neighbors had to peer over to see what all the laughter was about.
It requires no batteries and does not have to be recharged which is great!
One can get enough momentum to travel around even on a flat surface by turning the steering wheel back and forth.
The car comes in other colors but the red is pretty snazzy.
We love it and it is getting a lot of play out in this nice fall weather.
This Plasma Car is totally kid powered.
It was very easy to put together and well constructed.
Kids are very happy riding this toy.
They catch on very quickly as to how to maneuver the wheels to start the friction or just push it with your feet like my 2 1/2 year old did before she learned how to turn the wheel.
It allows you to make very tight turns.
We actually use ours inside and outside.
At random I find the kids on it roaming the house for fun.
Being it cuts turns so nice and glides they can maneuver it without hitting anything.
My daughter rides it in the house every day.
Its actually parked in our kitchen in the corner as they use it so much!
Its been great over the winter season when they can't go out and ride bikes in the snow and such.
Come Spring we will use it outside more as well but it has been awesome inside.
Its recommend to use on a flat surface which makes total sense.
Grass.. gravel sand, etc won't work.
Carpet won't work either.My 13 year old it too.
I would recommend this for a special needs child like my son.
My kids range in age from 2 through 13.
When we first opened this up, I thought because of the size it'd only be fun for my four year old.
I was wrong!
My 13 year old daughter fits on this as well.
A great buy!
!
I had seen these things before, though neither I nor my kids had ever tried one out.
With the toy's numerous awards and positive reviews, I really had my expectations set high for this - too high, as it turns out.The toy/vehicle was quite easy to assemble (you could really figure this thing out with no directions, but consult them first, anyway).
I had it put together in about five minutes.
No tools necessary, no delicate decals to affix, no batteries to install, no measurements to make or things to cut or anything difficult at all.
Great so far!
Now to test it out.I sat on this thing and tried to operate it to show my kids how to do it.
(I had watched the demonstration video, online, so I knew what to do.)
I couldn't get the thing to move at all across the linoleum floor.
OK. Not a problem.
Let's try the concrete floor in the garage.
Maybe there's not enough friction on the clean linoleum for it to gain traction, right?
I had some little success in the garage, but I was still barely outpacing a snail.
I began to think I was too heavy for it to work.
(I weigh 175 and the toy says it accomodates up to 250 pounds, so I assumed I would be fine.
According to the manufacturer, you can put some pretty hefty kids on this thing, but maybe they were exaggerating...)I had my 75-pound middle school student get on it and give it a try.
With a starting push, she could maintain the momentum for a time, but the thing just moved sooooo slowly!
"When children argue over a toy, you know it's a hit.
If you could only hear my kids fight yesterday, you'd know PlasmaCar is a roaring success.I knew they'd like it.
Their friends have two PlasmaCars and my kids always ride on them when they visit.
When we see the cars at the mall, they always have to have a go.Our one and only car has been in constant use ever since I put it together.ASSEMBLYYou'll need a rubber mallet and a screwdriver with a long, skinny shaft.
The type of screwdriver doesn't matter, you'll be using the shaft for leverage.It's very easy to assemble.
I put it together in just a few minutes.
Attach the wheels and steering wheel and you're done.INDOORS OR OUTDOORSThis car can be used on any hard, smooth surface.
I don't recommend a gravel road or carpeting.
It's great on tile and hardwood floors and is a good indoor riding toy.
Operate by turning the steering wheel back and forth, rolling the car along in a snakelike motion.
Hard, head-on collisions into furniture are not likely when used as intended.It's all muscle-powered, which is great in this day and age of electric-powered everything.
I like any toy that gets my children moving and away from the more sedentary, mind-numbing pursuits.The car holds up to 220 pounds.
My husband, at 6'2"" and 190 pounds, propelled himself around the kitchen and foyer without problems.OVERALL IMPRESSIONMy kids want me to buy them a second PlasmaCar so they don't have to fight.
Sharing is something they don't want to learn, if the toy is this much fun.They're eight and eleven, but they've played on their friends' PlasmaCar for a few years, so it can be fun for all school age children.
Younger children can push themselves along with their feet until they get the concept.This is a great toy.
Both kids give it an enthusiastic five stars."
I have 3 kids (11, 6 and 4 years old) and they all love this car.
First of all, no batteries nor gas needed.
All it takes is a little motion of the steering wheel and the car starts.
(If only we can make cars that run on just human power just like this.
What a big difference in the world will it makes.)
No learning curve as even my 4 year-old daughter can drive it immediately.
In fact, it seems that the lighter the passenger, the faster the car goes.Another amazing thing is how it can squeeze in really tight spots.
Our hardwood living room is a great place for them to play around.
Perfect place would be a gym or any smooth surfaced roads.I did the assembly in about 5 minutes.
The only tool needed is a screwdriver to turn the tool wrench for the steering wheel (and comes with the car).You would think it is a toddler toy.
What is surprising is it is my 11-yr-old who adore it the most.
It's great to see the PlasmaCar back in style.
My kids used to clamor for one years ago when they were sold at a nearby mall, so they were happy to have one of their own at long last.Assembly was very easy and took just minutes; a hex wrench is even included.
The hardest parts are making sure the rear wheels are on the correct sides and the steering wheel is right side up.We tested this out on our kitchen floor and asphalt driveway, and with only a small learning curve, both the kids and I got it scooting around.
Fun!
It would be even more fun in a large gym, or school hallways.
The car itself is lightweight and easy to toss into the back of a van or large trunk, and appears to be durable.I'd say this is worth the price - we may even buy a 2nd one.
What a fun toy.
It's super easy to put together--took 5 min.
One big piece of plastic and then just screw in the wheels and the steering wheel.
It's very durable and got a big seat area so my 5 year old and my 3 year old were able to sit on it together!
They probably couldn't ride around forever that way but it certainly made it easy to share when they first played with it.
Simple turn the steering wheel and the scooter goes.
Lots of leg room so I think kids who are tall for their age could fit fine.
We have wood floors so I don't recommend riding it on them but great for outdoors or non-wood surfaces.
We got one of these for the grandkids, and they all love it, from the 2 year old up to the 11 year old.
Only problem is keeping the older ones from riding it down hills!
The kids have had so much fun with this, we got one for the niece and nephews.All you  have to do is sit on it, put your feet up on it and wiggle!
Great fun.
"I got one of these for my 5 year old, and he loves it more than his bike, his old tricycle, and any other moving toy he ever had - combined.
It's super-easy to use, very intuitive, very sturdy, and as far as I can tell from having him zoom around in it for several hours, as safe as these things get.
I know it says ""indoors and outdoors"" but unless you live in a warehouse, I'd recommend saving this one for outdoors.
Really.
Still, it's a pure blast, and I recommend it.
(This will also work for older kids, by the way - it's supposed to be for people 200 lbs.
and up, and I promise you it works for adults too.
This thing is a blast.)"
When I tried this car out, it was so much fun.
It holds up to 220lbs so adults can get in on the action.
I am buying another one for my 5-year old niece.
It is great exercise as well.
In my opinion, there is no way a child will not love this toy!
When we took it out of the box, I thought it would be too young for my kids (9,7, & 6) but once we put it together (all you need is a hammer and a screwdriver or rachet), it turned out to be great fun for the whole family.It's very easy to put together.
You just pop on the back wheels and line up the front wheels and steering wheel and tighten, then you're good to go.
It says not to use on hardwood floors, but as it was dark out and we really wanted to try it out, we used it on hardwood.
The wheels do slip on the wood, but it didn't scratch our floor.My kids used it the first night for about 1.5 hours before bedtime.
Mom and Dad even took a turn on it.
It's fun and totally powered by you, so it's pretty good exercise too.
The 6 year old wants to ride it to school, which we might allow, at least until the snow starts.We may have to buy another one so that the kids can race!
It will be loads of fun in the spring and summer!
In my title I state that it is awesome for rainy days because that is when it arrived.
It was a build that only required a Philips screwdriver and rubber mallet and before long the kids were fighting over it that afternoon.Is it fun?
Absolutely!
It is a bit pricey?
Not anymore...
I originally purchased this item in 2009 for my nephew and it was so much more expensive at that point.
Can us adults fit on it?
Yes, but it sure hurts my ahem* bigger booty.
It's pretty funny watching my legs cramped and bent in the most awkward position.
I am not winning any races; I will leave the imagery at that.
The point that I am trying to make is that up to a 220 pound adult can ride on a smooth surface.
The number seriously declines when you reach the sidewalk or rough surface to about 110 pounds.
My husband did not enjoy it because he can't keep his legs in that position, but the kiddies aged 6, nearly 9 and 10 had a ball and were swift and fluid in their maneuvers.
We have hardwood flooring and it seems that this is one of the best surfaces for optimal speed and maneuverability.
It struggled on our rug that is in our bedroom, and there was a bit of stiffness once it hit the sidewalk the next day.
I do not see this being able to go over grass or thick carpet in a home.I love that this toy has such an amazing and expansive age/weight range.
