Reviews:
I got this for my six year old son who loves cars.
He was really excited when he opened the amazon.com box and saw this toy; it has gotten countless hours of play.The pros: It is self storage containing, no extra containers needed to keep this toy organized.
there is a lock that keeps the toy closed, even when it gets dropped.
It comes with two cars, which allows for sharing.
There is no batteries required, which means endless hours of playtime.The Cons: It was a little difficult to put together, and the directions were not very clear, and the print was awfully light.
The toy is a little difficult to open up and close up, which leads to frustration.I gave this toy a four star because of the little bit of frustration which comes from it not being very easy for a six year old to open this toy by themselves.
Otherwise, spot on job, matchbox!
Seriously, my nephews two favorite things...Dinosaurs and cars.
I figured he would love this toy, and I was right.
There are a few problems...it's a pain in the butt to get it out of the packaging...like REALLY.
You also need to have the car to go with it.
It doesn't come with this set.He got this set, and the Yeti one and this is by far the favorite.
It also seems less fragile and was a bit easier to understand the directions.
Sigh.
This is a racetrack.
For cars.
With a Tyrannosaurus Rex built in.
With that kind of ingredient list you would think the result would = awesome, but it ends up looking like this:Racetrack + Cars + Dinosaur = JunkWhile a good idea, this toy just does not work and won't last you long.
Here are a few problems we've noticed in the week we've had it.
* One flap already broke off, just by opening and closing cage* Cage action doesn't work well.
Kids have trouble opening by themselves.
You can 'lock' it in once open, but doesn't really work.
* Confusing to figure out all that it does.
I still can't figure out how to make it do what the kids want half the time.
* Folds up unexpectedly .
.
.
every other time someone touches it.My boys like it, but mainly because it has a dinosaur on it.
You will be better off getting the benefit of a dinosaur toy by picking up a stuffed or rubber dinosaurs like these:12 - Assorted Medium Sized Plastic Toy Dinosaurs Play set figures.. You will also save $25 .
Our five year old grandson Gage loves both cars and dinosaurs, so I think the combination of the two is genius!
They will definitely need help setting it up.
I'm not even sure I could have done it by myself.
Luckily, our son is quite mechanically confident and was able to put it together quickly.
For young age groups like this you will have to supervise for sure.
I'm also not sure how durable it is (time will tell), but he has had a ton of fun with it.
There are especially big laughs and giggles when the dinosaur swallows the car they included.
He uses his small truck to hit it just right and the dinosaur 'poops' the other car out, which has him laughing hysterically every time.
I love it!
I'm not sure how educational it is, other than him learning the name of the dinosaur, but it is loads of fun.
There is only one car, but it is easy enough to find another car/train to bring into the fun.
Sometimes the dinosaur doesn't always 'burst' out of the cage as advertised, but it comes out fast enough to be fun...even if you have to help it along.
I'm not sure I really would want it to come out to fast since that might be unsafe.
I think perhaps 'burst' might have been the wrong word to use when describing the action.
The reaction of my grandson?
This is his favorite toy right now and that makes it great with this grandma.
"The Dino adds a cool factor to it, what little boy doesn't like dinosaurs?
When my two boys saw it, they screamed with delight.We've had a few of the Matchbox sets like the new Dino Breakout.
They all are of an average quality with each having a few flaws in the design and play of them.
The Dino Breakout is a little different in that it is its own carrying case.
The set comes with one car but actually requires two cars to play with it as instructed; you may already have other Matchbox cars that will work with it, we did.There are other play sets that can be bought and connected to this one so I think Matchbox intends this to be the starter set on a whole adventure city but this set can be played with all by itself and doesn't have to have additional purchases except for the additional car.It took several minutes of trying to get the set out of the frustrating packaging, just opening the boxes up on toys these days can take several minutes.
A couple more pieces had to be attached and we applied the stickers as well.
We finally got down to play.It takes a few times to figure out exactly how it works and even then, it doesn't work flawlessly every time but works pretty good as compared to other Matchbox sets that we have had.You start with the play set closed up and place the included car at the top of the opening at the dinosaur's mouth and press a button, the dinosaur swallows up the car.
You must then open the play set: grab the handle and take your other hand and place it at the back and bottom of the set where there is a place for your hand and pull up quick and hard on the handle, the set opens up.You now need to take what Matchbox calls the ""rescue car"" (hence the need for an additional car that is not included) and release it from the top of the ramp.
It runs through the Dinosaur's leg and get the car that's trapped inside his mouth, now down to his tummy.
Roll the car down the ramp again and the Dinosaur will shoot the trapped car out his backside and the rescue car will shoot out another exit and the whole play set will snap back together, trapping the Dinosaur in his cage again.
It's actually pretty fun and worked most of the time.
Sometimes you would have to adjust the ramps, etc.The set is a little smaller that I expected for the price tag.
Given the price tag, it wouldn't hurt them to include the second car, especially since it's actually required to play with as instructed.
Honestly I think this set is worth no more than $25.
I think it would be a great Christmas or Birthday present but look for it on sale."
The Dino playset was easy to assemble and star to play, you pull up the handle and that's it, you can choose to play in expanded way or you can play with the cage mode and it will close like a cage every time you drop the car.
My son likes it a lot, he has other cars and some models of hot wheels and Matchbox can fit in this playset not all the cars fit especially in the mouth of the dinosaur they can get stuck there.
After you finish playing you just close the cage and no need to a big spot to storage.
This is a compact playset.
"Packaging is medium frustration level.
You'll need a small blade for cutting the tape and removing some packaging.
There are a number of grey plastic parts used to hold the toy in the packaging, including a large spring-loaded tube which can all be discarded.
There are two plastic pieces (one grey, one red) that are loose in the bottom of the package with the instructions and which have to be attached to complete the toy.Unless you've seen a video it's hard to figure out how this things works.You start with everything folded up, and the included car on top with its wheels in the little wells.
You press the red button and (if you're lucky) the platform the car is on will tip forward, the car will enter the dino's mouth, and the dino's head will pop up.Next you pull up on the handle to expand the set completely (this can be a bit difficult for a child to get the hang of).
The cage opens, and the racetrack deploys around it.
You will need to manually fold out and rotate the red starting piece of track at the top if it saw stowed, and you may need to manually align any pieces of track that failed to unfold or fall into place properly.So now you launch the rescue car.
Rescue car?
You did bring along another Matchbox or Hot Wheels car to the party I hope because this set only comes with one car and that one is now deep in the dino's digestive system.So anyway, the rescue car starts at the top on the red launching platform (there's a little ridge where the back wheels rest and then you press the tab behind the car to release it on its way).
The car runs around the track and passes under the dino's foot.You do this three times.
The first two times the rescue car pushes through the dino's foot and drops down a ramp and shoots straight out to the left.
The third time the ramp under the foot does not drop and the car is sent on the rest of the track around the back and into the bottom where it trips a lever which causes the entire toy to collapse, the cage folds up, the dino poops out the trapped car which runs out to the left and the rescue car flys out the front at the bottom.It's actually quite impressive when it all works.Issues are that sometimes at the very beginning when you press the red button to drop the first car into the dino's mouth it might just get stuck.
It actually works best if you use your ""other"" car as the trapped car, since the car that comes with the set has more mass than average and is more successful at operating the mechanism as it runs down the main track.
Any typical sedan/sports car style Matchbox or Hot Wheels car should work well for the cat that gets eaten, but larger/taller cars might be problematic.If the cage collapses the first time you send the rescue car around, it's because you didn't press down the dino's nose at the beginning so that it's inside the cage when the first car gets eaten.It's still a bit of a one-trick-pony, and I don't expect it to hold the attention of a 6yo for very long until the ""experimental"" phase kicks in, after which it will probably just sit in the closet due to the lack of variety in play available.G."
You know how pop-up books magically spring to life?
Well, the Dino Breakout is like a pop-up toy.
It starts as a nice self-contained box which is easy to store and carry around.
With a simple pull of the handle, it transforms into a dinosaur racetrack.
Except for the car, there are no loose parts.
The concept of an all-in-one toy with no loose parts is fantastic for parents who are tired of picking up random toy parts all over the house.The execution of this toy leaves a bit to be desired however:-The playing instructions are poorly presented in small, monochromatic diagrams.-The car is supposed to be able to pass through the dinosaur mouth and body but it gets stuck half the time.-In order to play as intended, you will need buy a 2nd car.
You will want a 2nd car that is small enough to easily fit through the dinosaur body which might be hard to find.-There are limited ways to play with this toy.
There isn't much variety in paths for the car and there are no customization options.
This means there is a good possibility your child will get bored watching the car do the same thing every time.Some things are done well:-The car travels down the racetrack consistently without falling off or getting stuck.-The mechanism to open and close the toy has worked consistently well so far.
A lock button is present so you can lock it open or closed.Overall, I love the concept of an all-in-one toy.
The Dino Breakout is a decent effort but feels half-baked.
A few tweaks and enhancements though could turn this into a great toy.
If you have a child that loves Dino's , this will be fun.My grandson is 4 1/2, and loves anything that is Dinosaurs .This is made to fold up and is fun for the child to take to a friends house /park, and play with this.You have to escape the Dino, from eating cars , but they do escape out of the tail, and make a run for it.There are a few different ways to play with the dino..Dino eats the cars & trucks that come with this,and poops them out the tush..Kids get a great laugh!You try and trap the dino in the cage, push the handles down fast, now you have a trapped dino.This goes with the other Matchbox toys.
You can add on by buying other match box..
I like this toy, but it was hard for my 5 year old to maneuver, we also had issues with the car getting stuck in the the dinosaur.
The car didn't always go where it was supposed to and the instructions on how to play were not the greatest.
My son is enjoying the toy, but it isn't the greatest.
I gave this to my husband to open and set up, and soon I heard my 4yo son having a blast with it.
I asked if there were instructions and hubby said no, not really.
Okay, then I figured it must be fairly self-explanatory.
Except when my son came crying to me that it wouldn't stay open...I had no idea...and it took a good few minutes before I figured out what was supposed to happen (you have to pull up on the handle until the thing locks in the open position).
That said, it took reading some reviews here for me to understand how the thing was supposed to work!!
So, either my hubby was lying and there really WERE instructions...or there really weren't any and that's a bad thing.
Once I saw what was supposed to happen, my son had more fun with it because it wasn't snapping shut after every time the car was released.
But I would have thought as a 40yo with a college degree I'd have been able to figure it out without instructions...But my son loves this thing, it doesn't require batteries, and it doesn't make any super annoying loud sounds...so three stars.
We like it.
"This is a fun toy: kids will get some enjoyment (to some parents' chagrin) with cars shooting out the dinosaur's rear end... but they'll also generally enjoy the idea of a dinosaur eating their cars; my kids have quite a few cars already, so the dinosaur munched away for quite a while!
With that said, they can't exactly take the dinosaur out and walk around the room with it, munching cars as they flee.
This limits the extent to which they can take their imagination.
So it's good, but not unbelievably fantastic, it can also contribute to some undue silliness (""My car came out of the dinosaur's butt!
Hey watch my car come out of the dinosaur's butt!
Ha-ha-ha!!!""
ad nauseum...)I did not think it was very difficult to put together - didn't watch the video or anything - it just sort of ""made sense"" like putting together a puzzle based on the pictures on the box.
The packaging was just as annoying as any other toy packaging, though.
But I guess I'm used to that.All in all I like it: the silliness wears down after a while, and the enjoyment factor is worth it: this is the 7th ramp-like thing we've tested with our boys, and I'd say it's in a three-way tie for ""most fun."""
"I ordered this toy for my cousin's four-and-a-half year old son, who is really excited about dinosaurs.
The toy seems very well made and sturdy, as if it will hold up to a lot of enthusiastic play.
The toy was a little difficult to unpack (lots of plastic ties), but we eventually got it set up.
Brandon loved seeing the little car come out of the dinosaur's rear end--he roared with laughter at this.
Unfortunately, we could not figure out how to make the dinosaur ""eat"" the car.
We decided to wait and see if Brandon's dad could figure out this aspect of the toy.Brandon really liked this toy, even though it did not work as it was supposed to.
I will update this review as soon as I hear whether or not the dad was able to get it to work as advertised.Update--Brandon's dad was not able to make the toy operate as it should.
Brandon still loves it, but he would love it more if it worked as it is supposed to.
If anyone has any suggestions, I would love to hear them.
Thanks!"
I gave this toy to my 6 year old grandson.
His eyes lit up and he waited impatiently while his grandfather figured out what you do with it.
Once set up it works well, and it is a cute concept geared perfectly for little boys.
We soon learned we needed to find another car.
Luckily the kids have a huge collection and we found a few that work  because not every small car worked when we tried them.
I like how it is self contained, since so many toys lose critical parts shortly after arriving.
The biggest problem I had with this is that after watching the dino eat a few cars, and shoot them out, it loses it's draw, as there's not much in the way of imaginative play involved and so it got old quick.
After a few short sessions, my grandson no longer asks to play with this toy.
"I got this for my nephew's son, who is the All American Boy.
With the car/dino combo, it's hard to go wrong.
Better yet, the car comes out of the dino's bottom---what five-year-old is not going to roll on the ground over that?With that in mind, it's too expensive to come with only one car.
When the car is trapped, who is supposed to come rescue it?
Come on, Matchbox, for this price you can surely cough up another car.I also suspect that durability is going to be an issue.
I love the idea that you can pack it up and take it with you, but things don't stay attached in a ""lock"" position very well.
If you are looking for a toy that you can pass down to the next child, this probably isn't it.At this price, with these limitations, I would not rush out to buy another one.
However, if your child likes cars and dinos and you can find one on sale, it's non-electric (which is always a huge plus for me) and should at least be a temporary hit."
This dinosaur toy is an absolute waste of money.
I'm not sure I even understand the concept of a dinosaur toy mixed with a matchbox car toy; it seems a little forced.
On top of that, the design of the toy is very poor.
After playing with it for no more than five minutes, the car ended up stuck in the bowels of the toy and it took me a while to be able to get it out.
When the whole toy collapses (a feature about which the box boasts), it is very difficult for a child to reopen it in a way that makes it stay open.
I'm not even sure I completely understand why it closes in the first place, except to make it easier to transport, but it is way too easy for the car to trip the gizmo that closes the toy.
It's just not very practical for little kids.
Our kid loves to play imaginatively so he's been enjoying it, but it's not at all because of the toy itself.
It just seems lazy on the part of the toy manufacturer.
Sad to say, another plastic dust collector.
When I first got this toy I thought it was way to simplistic to hold the attention of the kids; how many times would you really want to put the car in and out?
Boy, was I wrong.
This has quickly become one of the boy's (ages 10 to 6) favorite toys.
It is used over and over and over in the house and has been for almost a month now.
It's the first toy their friends go to when they come to visit.
Crazy!
Even my 3 year old daughter likes to do it, even if she needs a little help with setting the spring and ramps.That being said, it really needs two cars to make it work; yet it only comes with one.
If you have boys in the house this will probably NOT be a problem, since it's almost a guarantee that your son has more cars around!
LOL  Also, I'm not sure about how it's going to hold up; it has a lot of little ramps that don't seem very sturdy.
On the other hand, the boys have been using it for almost a month nonstop and there are no broken pieces yet.
So even though it may not be MY favorite toy, I can't complain because it's definitely theirs, and it hasn't fallen apart yet!HIGHLY recommend for boys of all ages!
Battery-operated Matchbox Dino Breakout Playset.
This is a great alternative to yet another matchbox race track set.
It's enough of a challenge to operate to keep an old year old occupied and provides lots of interactivity.
Oh, and it features a giant orange dinosaur.
What more does an eight year old want?
Now if only the next generation could squirt flames too .
.
.
.
"So basically this playset has two modes: the collapsed box, and the exploded out track.You start the adventure off by releasing the included car off a small ramp/trap door into the dinosaur's mount.
From there, you pull the playset apart to get to its ""exploded out""  track mode.
If all the pieces of the track fall into place properly (which doesn't happen to the point where you need to make adjustments a good portion of the time), then you can send a car down a spiraling track several times on your way to ""saving"" the car the dinosaur ate.At first, the car hits the dinosaurs foot and rolls down a trap door behind the dinosaur.
After a few times, you'll have tripped the lever that changes the car's course on the next run, where it rolls in a spiral on the outside of the track, then bursts through a door in the bottom-middle of the playset.
The dinosaur poops out the trapped car, the ""saving"" car rolls to safety and the spring-loaded playset collapses into its ""box"" mode automatically so you can repeat the process.It's really pretty cool!The only bad part is that 1. you need smaller/heavier Matchbox cars for the cars to be swallowed and roll properly: not every car will work with the playset and 2. you have to buy the second ""saving"" car separately and 3. you often need to help the car along the track and adjust the ramps because things don't align perfectly.A neat toy overall, but don't expect it to be 100% reliable and perfectly operating every time."
"I ordered the Matchbox Dino Breakout Playset for my four and a half year old grandson.
When I see the ""Matchbox"" brand, I expect any toy they make to be durable and fun.
I remember the fun my brother and I had with our Matchbox cars and the fun my children had, and I expected my grandson to have fun also.
He announced this year at preschool that he wanted to be a paleontologist when he grew up.
At this stage in his life, he is more than obsessed with dinosaurs, especially the T-Rex.
He also has several race car sets and has been enjoying them since he was around two years old.
I thought this toy would be a perfect meld of both of his interests.
I can report that he loves to play with it, loves the T-Rex model and loves that the cars fly down the ramp and the T-Rex ""eats"" them.
However, I have to say that this toy does not hold his attention for very long, since it is fairly repetitive.
He races a car down the ramp, the car goes into the T-Rex and comes out the T-Rex and down the ramp.
It's possible he's a little too old for this toy since ""just"" racing cars gets old pretty fast.
Adding the element of danger with his favorite ""reptile"" does help.
He can be a bit creative, but as far as being an educational toy, I would say that some of his other dinosaur books and games are more educational and hold his attention much longer.I believe that this Matchbox set can be combined with other sets and that could quite possibly solve the monotony problem.
I think I might do a little more investigation before I ordered another Matchbox Playset.
I'm not sorry that I gave my grandson this Dino Breakout toy, but it's just not a big favorite of his.
Perhaps if the child for whom you are buying is more into the intricacies of racing cars and is fond of the Matchbox Series of cars, it might be a better fir.
My kids LOVE the Matchbox Dino Breakout playset.
As a parent, it's nice to have a toy that goes beyond it's basic function.
While originally the kids played with it as it was designed, the toy quickly became much more.
Now, from watching the kids, I think this is where the Hulk goes to train for the Avengers.
Or something like that...The playset does fold up, which is great for storage.
However, it is kind of a pain for the kids to put it back together by themselves, needing adult help to do it right.
Packaging was a huge pain in the you know what, but we did have it out of the box and being played with pretty quickly, maybe twenty minutes.
Still, that is a long time for a five year old to stand there waiting to play with a toy.All in all, the kids really like it, not a lot of pieces that can go missing, and easy storage.
"Note: my reviews are from 2 grandparents who acquire gifts for our 3 and 5-yr-old grandkids.
I rate toys for ""gift impact,""  youngster's excitement upon opening, fun, and toy longevity.
This review is intended to assist other grandparents and those who buy gifts for friends and relatives.
Since we're buying on Amazon, we sometimes don't even see the things - they're delivered.
So it's important to know if you get bang for your buck.
If you're a parent looking for another parent's recommendation, you'll find it elsewhere.This is an exciting gift for a boy!
It's made for action - and if you remember the Jurassic Park movie where foolish men brought T-Rex to a city by ship, you'll get the concept of this fun toy (although I doubt they paid the filmmakers any royalties).It's from Matchbox.
Those of us who played with the tiny cars that originally fit in a real matchbox will remember (although it's now a product of by mega-toy-co., Mattel).As for the size of the gift and first impression: the boxed toy will excite as soon as the wrapping paper comes off.
The cutaway box is about 14"" square, and 5"" wide.
There's a bright orange dinosaur (definitely a T-Rex) standing in it with mouth agape, in an open cage.
Mattel combined the dino-appeal with a Matchbox car ramp raceway.
It's simple to set up - hit the red button to run the car down the ramp until the dino swallows it.
Then the job for the child is to battle the beast, release the car, and safely lock T-Rex in the cage.Hit the brute right, and he dumps the car out below his tail (to put it politely).
Let me tell you, one 4-yr old grandson thought that was hilarious!
He got the battle element right away, and enjoyed discovering the ways to defeat the monster.The toy has a built in handle that is needed to operate it, and for moving it around.It's durable, built for roughhousing.
Bound to be a hit.
Both my 6 year old and 10 year old really like this toy.
For me I think the operation of the box is a bit too touchy - have to pull up on the handle with just the right amount of force to get it to lock.
But the boys don't seem to mind.
The instructions are clear as mud in terms of how this thing works.
Although the kids give this 5 stars I will downgrade it (see note below).
Given the delicateness of the mechanism I can't see it holding up for very long.Thanks Amazon for rejecting the video review I labored over, BTW.
My boys shared their thoughts directly on this item, which would have been much more helpful to your customers than the thoughts of this old man.
My grandson is six and butt jokes are his forte right now.
A dinosaur who shoots cars from its butt, Awesome!
This unit does not need batteries, so that is a big plus.
It only comes with one car.
Not so good when you have two kids crying and fighting over who's turn it is.
Also, not all other small match box cars fit, you have to buy ones made for this toy.
The set can be hooked into other sets to make a play village.
The unit is self contained and has a carry handle.
I'm sure it will hold up until the jokes run out.
The kids gave it a five, I thought it was more like a three.
I'm still in charge, three stars.
