Reviews:
We home school our kids and got this LeapPad as a supplement for the younger kids when they have a few extra minutes while the older child is being worked with.
All of our kids love it.
The games are fun and they don't even realize they're learning while they play.
The unit itself is sturdy and I feel safer letting them play on this than handing them an iPad that is more fragile.
It is also great for long trips and keeps the kids entertained.
My kids love Leap Frog toys - to the point of even saving up their allowance to buy extra games for their devices.
The Leappad2 Power is the same great device, but with a few bonuses.
It comes with a battery pack for extended play, the AC adapter (nice to have it in a bundle instead of having to buy it separately) and a few extra apps.
The apps honestly we don't use.
There is now a calculator and a calendar, making the leap pad function a bit more like a smart phone, but apart from opening it up to see what it did, my four year old really doesn't need a calendar.As for the device itself, both the original and the LeapPad2 are fantastic learning tools for the 3-8 age range, and yet again, Leap Frog does not disappoint.
My main complaints with the original version were the easily damaged screen, the incredibly short-lived battery life and the difficulty getting into the battery compartment.
With version two, they have fixed the battery compartment issue - it is now much easier to get into, but also easier to snap into place without having to wiggle it just so.
It overall feels more secure.
The screen is still pretty easy to scratch, even with gentle playing with the provided stylus.
And after watching my two children play with it, ages 4 and 6, I can tell you that with some games, they want to attack the screen with the stylus.
I think this would happen with any touch screen device, but for a game that runs one hundred dollars, we're investing in some screen protectors to try to keep it nice as long as we can.
My four year old started out just using her finger for a lot of the games, and really this works fine for most of them.
However, once she started playing the art studio and Mr. Pencil, she realized the stylus gives much better control.
I've noticed a change in how she holds a pencil when she writes after she started playing the Mr. Pencil game.
Her writing has definitely improved, which I think is pretty amazing because she pouts every time we practice preschool writing, but with Mr. Pencil she can't wait to play the game.
Leap Frog is very skilled, in my opinion, at making learning fun.With its large screen, the Leap Pad 2 eats batteries for breakfast.
Okay, the LeapFrog LeapPad2 is addictive.
Kids will spend HOURS playing with it, if you let them.
Adults may get addicted to the quiet that it brings, unless siblings start fighting over it.
My 2.5 year old loves it.
My 4.5 year old loves it.
My 7 and 9 year olds love it.
I've even caught my 12 and 14 year olds playing with it, especially after we loaded a space game onto it.The LeapPad2 is a nice size for little hands.
It seems fairly durable, though I'm sure given enough time, my 2 year old could break it.
I am sure we're going to need a new stylus eventually as it will likely break off and be lost.
I would love to get an otter box and a screen protector on it as soon as possible.
For now, I just keep a close eye on who has it, where, and how they're playing with it.Registering the LeapPad at the LeapFrog website and downloading our 4 included games didn't quite go as smoothly as it could have.
I initially thought it was our slow satellite internet, or a browser issue.
Instead it turned out to be our Windows XP.
I had my husband take care of it and he had to find a patch or something online to get the LeapPad to communicate with our computer.
Once he did that, it worked fine.I will say that the apps it comes with start to get old fairly quickly.
We added a science game that still holds their attention, but I know they'll be begging for more games and apps soon.
Our family is huge fans of all the Leapfrog products.
They find them fun and I find them very educational.
Many of our Leapfrog toys wear out or break before they tire of them!!
The Leappad line is no exception to this.
The kids can spend an hour or so playing and learning--it's great for long trips and for situations with long waits (dr's offices, etc.
)After receiving and reviewing this product, I really find not many differences than the last generation version.
I do however LOVE the rechargeable battery it came with--so many times the kids leave the unit on!
The Leappad was easy to navigate for the kids and it's just plain fun for them.From my kids perspective though, I do think that there are certain limitations to the Leappad.
I think that the reputation of the product limits usability sometimes.
My son(7) loves to play his Leappad, but won't play it around his friends because he says that they will call him a baby.
Perhaps a little image tweaking for Leapfrog could widen their fan base a bit.
First off, I just assumed that this came with a Doc McStuffins game.
To be clear, it does not.
At the time of this review, this version costs about ten bucks more than the pink version.
For the extra money, you get a few wallpapers and a couple of extra stylus plus a $20 download card.
I&#8217;m not sure how much use you will get out of the extra stylus as the stylus connects to the LeapPad.
Generally, I would say that unless your child is a pretty hard-core Doc McStuffins fan, going with the plain pink LeapPad2 may be a better option.As for the LeapPad itself, it has some great upgrades from the previous LeapPad.
The two way camera is awesome.
My daughter loves to take videos and pictures of herself.
"This LeapPad2 is a great little item for younger kids.
It allows you to set your profile up to 6th grade but I can't believe a 6th grader would be caught dead with a LeapPad.
I find it very educational for kids in the 4-7 age brackets.
My granddaughter who is 6 has one and thoroughly enjoys hers.
I like that you can add apps.
It is especially great to have the camera and video option.
Kids love taking pictures and this is really a great way to allow them to do that.
I can't comment on other apps as I haven't explored their site yet.The rechargeable batteries are a life saver but they are easily accessible to the kids and I would be more comfortable for the smaller kids to have the battery ""doors"" screwed on.
I admit I had trouble with the download and finally gave up but will address that later.
My grandchildren have a host of toys over here for their visits and I am happy to be able to add this to the things they can play with here.Overall I think the LeapPad is a great educational toy for younger children, especially those whose parents have iPads."
The LeapFrog LeapPad2 Power learning tablet is a great learning toy for ages 3-8.
It's easy to set up by plugging it into your computer (mine recognized the device immediately) and following the prompts, the battery life is good (about 9 hours), tons of apps, and a happy kid!
What more could you want from an educational toy like this?
"My five-year-old daughter has been wanting a Leap Pad for about six months now since she played her cousin's, so I was happy to get the opportunity to try this one.
Boy am I glad we didn't spend money on it.The good points of this device begin and end with the ease of set up.
Out of the box, the Leap Pad will be ready to use in about ten minutes of hooking up to the internet and downloading from the Leap Frog website.When my daughter first got the Leap Pad, she dove right into it and played most of the rest of the day, pausing only when we insisted that she give her older sister a turn to satisfy her curiosity.
I was relieved that finally she won't be pestering me for my smartphone all the time.After playing with it again the next day for less than an hour, however, my daughter asked me for my phone again.
By the end of the week she had practically forgotten about the Leap Pad and was right back with the phone.
While giving in and letting her borrow my phone, I decided to see what this Leap Pad is all about.
Didn't take me more than 5 minutes to want my phone back.The package includes nine apps when you initially connect to the Leap Frog website.
Among these are a decent art program, a pet corner and a game that ""teaches"" the flags and various random useless facts about countries the majority of adults have never heard of.
There is also a calculator, a clock and a couple other apps your average preschooler will never touch.
To the extent she has used it at all since the initial days, my daughter only uses the pet and art apps.The package also includes a $20 download card in order to load more programs from the Leap Frog website.
At first I was pretty impressed.
The apps range from $5 and up and you get a discount the more apps you buy.
The apps include games, videos, ebooks and other sorts of ""educational"" material.
I was able to get five apps, so I was pretty happy.
At first the new apps didn't download to the device properly and my daughter couldn't find them, but my husband hooked the device back up to the internet and the problem resolved itself.The problem is, the apps are junk.
The games are very simplistic and repetitive.
The addition of a rechargeable battery makes the LeapPad 2 even better!
My son loves the ebooks and games that we have purchased and downloaded from Leapfrog.
Now I don't need to panic and bring a whole bunch of batteries with me when we head out on a trip.
If you are in the market for a LeapPad make sure you get the rechargeable battery, it's definitely worth it.
Our sons have enjoyed several different LeapFrog learning electronics throughout the years, and each of them has been great.
The LeapPad2 Power Learning Tablet continues this tradition of quality, entertainment and teaching.The LeapPad2 is squarely focused on learning games and apps but the great news is that your kids won't notice it because there is plenty of fun, creativity and imagination built in throughout the entire pallette of software choices.
Our six-year-old particularly enjoys using the camera and video recorder options and then making funny edits via the included Photo Lab app.It's also solidly-built.
Ours has taken a few tumbles out of the car or off the kitchen table and continues to perform like the day it arrived.The LeapPad2 comes in three models:  basic, Power and Ultra.
The basic and the Power are identical tablets - the only difference is that the Power package includes an AC adapter and rechargeable battery packs - both critical add-ons.
The two primary differences between this model and the Ultra above it are size (which I think that this LeapPad2 Power is already perfectly-sized for a five- to seven-year-old) and the addition of WiFi and web surfing.
Again, I think that this is actually in the Power model's favor - I enjoy knowing that there's an electronic device that he can enjoy and learn from without any connectivity that I then have to police and worry about.
For my money, the Power package is the way to go.
We already love Leapfrog products and this one was no different.
In the box, I found the following items:-Doc McStuffins Themed LeapPad-Rechargeable Battery Pack-Charger-$20 App Card-Two Extra Styluses in Pink and Purple.Set up was a little difficult.
You have to download a program from LeapFrog's website.
The program installed on my computer easily, but when I was installing apps, it kept losing the connection to the LeapPad.
Finally, I was able to get it to go through, but it took about an hour.The LeapPad itself is great.
My child has hurled it across the room, and it is sturdy and does not break (wouldn't recommend trying this, but two-year-olds and tantrums sometimes result in this effect).The apps are a little expensive, but sometimes app cards are on sale, and LeapFrog also offers discounts on bundles and multi-app discounts.Overall, I would purchase this.
LeapFrog has some excellent learning apps that are included and can be purchased.
You can also purchase an app and install your own music.
I love the LeapPad 2, we have two.
If this is your first LeapFrog system you will need to download the LeapFrog Connect application to your computer.
It's easy to do and doesn't take up TOO much room.
Then use the included USB cable to attach the LeapPad, turn the LeapPad on and the set up process will begin.
It is VERY straightforward, just follow the prompts.
You will get to pick a free game download, and you will also be offered a deal like buy three apps get one free, which is good just the first time you set up a new device.
I was prepared for the free app offer this time so I had shopped ahead of time on the Leapfrog website so I knew exactly which games I was interested in.
If you are considering an upgrade from an older device like the LeapPad 1 or Leapster GS you might like to know that if you have bought a downloaded app you have the ability to install it on up to three devices, as long as that app is supported on all your devices.
For us that meant I could easily install all five new games on both my LeapPad 2's.
No fighting over the new games!Unfortunately, the charger worked ONCE, and now doesn't.
We already had a LeapPad 2 and it drove me insane how fast it ate batteries.
I ended up buying this set of rechargeable batterieseneloop NEW 2000mAh Typical, 1900mAh Minimum, 1500 cycle, 4 Pack AA, Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries with 4 Position Chargerwhich are excellent, but I still felt like the Leapfrog systems should come with rechargeable batteries, not sell them for additional big bucks.
I was thrilled to see Leapfrog package the same LeapPad 2 (with a slightly different color face plate so I can actually tell them apart) with the charger.
The first time the battery charged correctly and gave us a couple weeks of use.
Yesterday I plugged it in, the button lit up orange to indicate charging, but in a couple of hours instead of turning green to show it was charged it started flashing orange instead.
When I removed the LeapPad from the charger the battery area was very warm, more than I am used to with rechargeable batteries.
We bought the original LeapPad when it first came out.
It was a pain to use because it took a long time to stat up, had a rather poor screen, and, worst of it all, the Leapfrog Connect software was absolutely terrible.This new version has improved every aspect, and the newer versions of Leapfrog Connect software (which I believe only runs on Windows, which is a bummer as my main computers are Macs, but do own a couple of PCs which unfortunately run the much hated Windows 8/8.1).
What has not improved is they still seem to use USB 1 as the connector, for it takes a long time to download software (apps, ebooks, videos or music) to the Leap Pad 2.
LeapFrog is apparently moving away from the cartridge model.
Even though this LeapPad still has a cartridge slot, it's hard to find LeapPad cartridges in stores or on Amazon.com.
Instead, apparently they expect you to download all software via LeapFrog Connect.Here's a money-saving tip:  you can buy the $20 LeapFrog download card for about 5 bucks off here on Amazon.com.
LeapFrog also has frequent discount codes, for example, currently you can use CELEBRATE to achieve tiered discount savings.Hardware-wise, LeapPad2 is solidly built.
It's easy to hold by kids -- at least that what mine told me.
the 5-inch screen has a resolution of 480x272, lower than that on the Nintendo 3DS, but okay for education-oriented games.
It comes with 4GB of built-in storage memory.
But it does not have an SD or micro SD slot for additional memory, so your kid should not transfer too much video or audio or photos to it.
It has two separate low-resolution cameras, one on front and one on back.While the screen is okay in pixel density, especially for the target audience, its brightness and contrast cannot be adjusted, unlike the old LeapFrog Explorer or Leapster, for example.
Worse, it still uses resistive touch technology, so it doesn't work well with fingers.
Instead, you're expected to use the attached stylus.
Here the stylus is literally attached via a lanyard to the side of the LeapPad2, and there's a little indented holder for the stylus, but it's a crude solution.
A stylus slot would have been a much better feature, so the stylus wouldn't fall out of place frequently.LeapFrog's learning apps are okay.
We are huge fans of all things LeapFrog.
Our children have grown up with a variety of LeapFrog handhelds and other devices that have served them well in teaching them reading and math, and even logic and reasoning skills.
I love the effortlessness of the games and education.
Education should be fun and should be rewarding: it sets children up with a lifelong love of reading and learning.This is the second of our themed LeapPad2s and this is another winner.
These colors are a welcome change to the longstanding green or pink variations - which really were a sad selection of colors - oh, and before that, the white didjes.
Our first Bundled set was LeapFrog LeapPad2 Disney/Pixar Monsters University Varsity Edition Bundle and it is just gorgeous.
It even has little horns on the top of the gel skin featuring Mike.I like these bundle packages especially.
The value to them is better than buying the parts, separately of course.
The included battery pack is also a great improvement to these devices.
The battery pack is a game changer.Once you set this LeapPad2 up with the basic info and connect it to your computer, the update should happen pretty quickly.
Mine didn't take a full minute.
It downloads the apps: Learning Songs, Art Studio, Clock, Calendar, NotePad and calendar and one app you choose from the 3 offered.
Every time I have set a LeapPad up lately, I have been offered a discount based on how many apps I buy, up to 30% off from 3 or more.
This deal is far better than the discounts that come in emails and I try to make sure I take advantage of them, even using my extra digital download cards to stock up.Multiple device app downloads: For a long time, you needed to purchase one app for each device, unless you ordered the game cartridges.
LeapFrog has become a lot more reasonable lately.
With these more recent LeapPad 2s and Ultras we are now able to purchase an app once and download it on up to three devices.
We need something for a long road trip and I didn't want a gaming system.
I looked around and leap frog has so many good qualities I decided to go for it.
It does have a long battery life we didn't have to worry about charging during the day.
The games it came with were not enough and I was able to go on line and really look at the games and get to see a bit before I bought.
I would suggest not letting your child see all the games or you will be loaded up quickly with expensive name characters.
My grand daughter is 4 and has used my IPad in the past so she knew how to get around pretty well and was willing to use some trial and error to figure out some things.
I am pleased at how well it holds up as it has hit the floor of the car more than once.
She loved the camera feature and took her own pictures from the trip.
A big success and as she grows I can see many games she would love to try so it is nice it can grow with her.
"Leapfrog's LeapPad2 Power is a big improvement over previous Leapster models.
Leapster products just keep getting better and better over time.
The LeapPad2 Power is a very high quality product ergonomically, and from a fit and finish perspective.We started our kids early on with Pixter, which was a product from another manufacturer, and then graduated them to Leapster.
We have owned a total of 5 Leapsters over the years, in Leapster, Leapster 2, and LeapsterGS versions.
We also own about 20 games for these earlier versions, which sadly cannot be used with the LeapsterGS or LeapPad2 Power.
All electronics manufacturers have to draw a line in the sand when it comes to backward compatibility, and that's understandable.
If you're an original Leapster owner, you have to take that into consideration as to whether the improvements above are worth starting from scratch.
Games for LeapsterGS and LeapPad2 Power are interchangeable.
This is true if they are a cartridge or a downloaded game.1.
The LeapPad2 Power has the best display of any Leapster product, measuring 4.5"" x 2.5"".
The graphics are very crisp and vibrant.
The screen is also very durable.
Original Leapster products could suffer damage to the screen resulting in dead pixels fairly easily.
The screen on the LeapPad2 is tougher.2.
LeapPad2 Power is much faster.
You really notice a reduction in the screen-to-screen lag time, boot ups, shut downs, etc.3.
"This LeapPad2 has proven to be a source of great enjoyment for our five year old daughter (she has owned it since the age of 4).
She likes the baseline games that came with the tablet and has fiddled around with the other baseline add-ins including the ArtStudio, PetPad, camera, calculator, and the calendar.The LeapPad 2 is extremely well constructed and of very high quality - just like the other LeapPad products that we have owned - and can take a beating.
The learning tablet does not come out of the box and hit the ground running.
Before you can use the tablet, you need to connect to a computer via a USB port (cable included) so that certain applications can be downloaded.
Although the LeapPad2 does not come ready to roll out of the box, the download is pretty much a snap so don't worry.
Of course, it makes it easier if you already have an account set up, which we did.
Actually I say ""don't worry"", but be forewarned that if your kids are impatient (like ours) an otherwise simple download can potentially turn into an excruciating ordeal.
Our LeapPad2 came with a DC charger - we keep it plugged in at night and run it during the day.
The rechargeable batteries hold a charge fairly well and we have not experienced any charging-related problems.Unfortunately, the games available for download are a bit expensive (price range at the time of writing is $20-$60); the downloadable apps are a little cheaper (range $5-$25).
At the rate our children go through games and then move on to another one, it does not make financial sense to download them; especially when we have free options for downloadable learning software for our IPad and Kindle.
This does limit the potential fun that the kids can have with the LeapPad2.
Fortunately, they seem content with the baseline features, so we have not pursued the issue further.All in all, this is a high quality learning tablet that keeps our kids entertained.
We just wish that everything associated with the LeapPad2 learning tablet was not so expensive."
We have had many different Leapster solutions, from the explorer, GS, LeapPad, and now even a LeapPad Ultra.
Overall, they're all great products, but this is the first &#34;Power&#34; version we've ever had (that wasn't an Ultra).
In the past, we've typically used rechargeable batteries, but it's nice to be able to have a LeapPad 2 that is rechargeable.
Overall, it makes it more simple, and the kids can even plug it in to continue to play if the batteries die.In terms of this being a Doc McStuffins specific bundle, my 2 year old daughter is a big fan of Doc.
We had previously given her a green LeapPad 2, but this one was so much better for her.
She loves the included Doc backgrounds, and the designs on the device itself.
As others have said, it is a bit sad they didn't include the actual Doc McStuffins game.
That being said, we did already own it, so it wouldn't have been much of a benefit for us anyway.
I do feel like other bundles I've seen had the game included, but I may be mistaken.
The $20 download card is always a nice plus, and could certainly be used to purchase the game.
Leapfrog always has discount codes, so it's pretty easy to get a game like Doc McStuffins for under $20 (regularly $25).Other than the above, it's a pretty normal LeapPad 2.
It works great (lots better than the technical issues of the LeapPad Ultra).
Very solid, well built product, and it's great for kids.
this is so awesome, as my son loves his leapPad 2, but it goes through batteries like crazy.
This is the perfect solution!
It has not run out of juice yet and we have had it all day on and off, and it plays as well as his other LeapPad.
I love the LeapPad brand, as it is one of the more educational toys my sin has, and the color and graphics are pretty good.
I wish there were more affordable apps however, as they are too expensive compared to the .99 cent and free games we often get on our I-Pad.
I can't tell you how many times I have been in a restaurant, department store, Disneyland line, or other public place and seen numerous children from toddler to five or six playing on an iPad.
Maybe I'm the outlier here, but I would never hand my $600 iPad (or my iPhone, for that matter) to a two year old!
Sure, there are some fun activities for toddlers there, but every time I see it, I'm just waiting for the kid to throw, drop, puke on, or otherwise destroy the iPad.
In steps the LeapPad2!This has everything you may want for your young child during those down times.
It has a touchscreen, it has apps (several really good ones built in, I might add), it has a rechargeable battery, and you can drop it!
For your child's sake, it also lacks several features of a regular tablet that you don't want your kids to have.
No Internet access (for this model, there is an upgraded model with a larger screen and WiFi).
That means no Skype, email, Facebook, or online predators.
While it does have cameras, your child can't just send his picture out there for anyone to see.
Your child cannot access your settings and remove your work VPN, a major plus!If you've ever been tempted to (or actually have) given your iPhone or iPad to your young child to make the waiting room quieter at the dentist, this is the gadget for you!
I bought my grandson a LeapFrog LeapPad 2 for Christmas last year when he was 2 1/2 years old.
I thought maybe it might be too hard for him to learn because of his age, but I was wrong.
He has mastered the LeapPad!He is now over 3 years old and the LeapPad 2 is still running and holding up after much use.I ordered this one as it has rechargeable batteries which is going to be a huge savings.
Again the LeapPad is so durable and virtually indestructive, especially with the little ones.
My grandson loves the apps and programs (art is his favorite) and he spends many hours on his LeapPad.
He has learned so much from the apps and programs that he knows all his ABCs, can count to 50, knows all his colors and is beginning to read.The LeapPad I bought last year is now going to my youngest grandson and I am sure that he will spend quiet hours on it and he will learn a lot from it.
My kids love LepFrogs products and we own several LeapPads.
It's a great learning tool for little ones 3-9ish.
Battery life is much improved with this one you can run it for about 8 hours, the screen seems improved as well these things can handle rough treatment from the little ones.
Love the Gift card you can load up on apps/books/games ect, also the rechargeable battery a huge plus.The games on the Leap site can be pricey, but they are truly fun and educational well worth it.
Speaking of cost if your kids are the careful kind and slightly older you could get a Tablet say Kindle even for not much more than this -so I would consider that.
All in all you can't go wrong with LeapFrog.
"Leapfrog is a great company for electronic toys for toddlers through young elementary kids.
The leappad 2 power is no exception.
I will say, we have numerous leapfrog products and love them all.
I really think that are much better in quality and performance than their competitors.
We've had the original leappad for over 2 years now.
Not only is this much faster and has the forward facing camera.
It also adds extra ""apps"" like a clock, calendar, calculator, and notepad.
My two year old has really taken to it but it has not replaced the iPad.
We have a 6.5 year old (very advanced for his age) who has outgrown the educational value of the games but still enjoys playing on it.
Yes, the games do cost $ and more than the those available in the App store and android market place.
On the other hand, you are not spending $400 for a toy for your preschooler and if it's damaged (difficult but I'm sure there are many kids who do not know how to properly treat electronic.
We gave away our old leapster2 (4.5 years old) in good working condition so they do last and can be handed down).
We have never had a leappad product break (we do keep them in proper cases) so I think they are more durable than a typical tablet without a sturdy case.
The games for the most part are great, you can preview most (if not all) of them online and there's always a sale (I have never paid full price for a game).
All in all, I think it's a great edutainment item that will reinforce what the kids are already learning while they are having fun."
"So far we love the LeapPad2 Explorer.
First I must say the product packaging has been improved and is very easy to open.
I watched a video of someone doing and unboxing of the old packaging and it was quite a struggle for them.
Second improvement would be the included rechargeable battery pack.
You are saving a fortune on batteries with this feature!
There are two battery compartments, once you plug in the power pack on each side you are good to go.
It was a little tricky getting one of the covers to line up properly, thankfully you only need to do that once.So once you are ready to get started, ours came with a good partial charge so we were able to start using it immediately.
On a full charge you get up to 9 hours use which is fantastic!
My son who is just finishing second grade took a look and his first impression was that it looked cool but he realized that it was educational and was a little skeptical on that point.
Once he started using it he realized it was educational AND he was having fun.
What more could you ask for?Several titles come preloaded on the tablet and when you connect to the internet you get to choose one of three options as an additional title free.
There are downloadable titles on the web that range between $5-25.
There is a ""just fun"" category complete with kidz bop music!
There are plenty of choices by skill set, age range and favorite characters such as Thomas the Train, Phineas and Ferb, Monsters University and Spongebob.
I also like that you can get gift cards for the downloadable apps.
Naturally as with other leap systems, they sell cartridges as well.Also trying it with a six year old friend and he enjoys it as well when he is over our house.
This tablet is perfect for a child who is interested in having his/her own tablet, but is not ready for the responsibility of caring for an expensive grown-up tablet.The apps/games it comes with are minimal, but my 3-year old grandson greatly enjoys the built-in camera and pet care app that comes pre-installed.
There are not a huge number of items (there are apps, storybooks and videos) that can be downloaded from the Leapfrog site, but there are enough to keep a young child entertained.
Those that are available are educational, reasonably priced for the most part, and feature characters that your child will already be familiar with like Team Umizoomi and Doc McStuffins.
If I had one nitpick it would be that you can't get Angry Birds for this tablet, which is the 3-year-old's favorite game.This tablet has been treated rather roughly, and dropped more than once, but seems no worse for wear.By the time your child is 5-6 they will probably outgrow this, but if your 3-year-old is jealous of your or his/her older sibling's tablet, this is a good option.
LeapFrog LeapPad 2 is the advanced version of the previous LeapPad with rechargeable batteries.
This is truly a great feature since we don't have to worry about packing batteries with us on our trips.
You also get the front and rear camera  and double the memory.
The apps are a bit expensive but are a great learning tool for your child as all LeapFrog products are.
Their customer service is also exceptional and you do feel that they truly back their products.
The device charges quickly and lasts for at least 8 hours of fun!
We have four kids.
My older kids all had Leapsters and I'm a big fan of LeapFrog and their products.
However, I think they need to realize that they can't charge $25 for an app these days, when my kids can buy an app for their Kindle Fire or iPad for 99 cents.
I understand that cartridges used to be $20, but the market has moved on.
I also hated that I had to hook up the LeapPad to my computer via a USB cable to update anything.
The advantages of the LeapPad is it's much more durable than a typical tablet (not sure compared to the Nabi, and the LeapFrog games have been tested and perfected for years.
My kids love playing the games&#8230;but more than the other apps?
I can't say that.I loved (and my daughter loved) the Doc McStuffins design.
It's adorable.
The LeapPad is pretty easy to set up.
You have to put the rechargeable batteries in (put the square like tab in first&#8230;then the cylinder)&#8230;and charge it, before connecting it to your computer to download the 9 free apps.
The $20 card it came with is great, but once again, with the price of the apps, you can still end up shelling out $5 for a lot of apps, or might get one to download without additional money.Once again, I'm a big fan of their products, but I don't see that this is any better than the Kindle Fire with FreeTime we have for the kids, or even a regular iPad.
The price point for the LeapPad is less, but with the $30 off deals for KindleFire, and the Prime deal on Free Time which gives you new monthly content for your kids, you'll end up saving long term.If LeapFrog dropped the price on their apps, nothing should be more than $9.99, and most should be under $5.00, then I'd give it five stars.
But with the price of the apps today, I can't.
"We have owned both the LeapPad 1 and the LeapPad 2.
I got each of them as soon as they were released.
My kids are 6 and 3 now and tend to play a lot of video games on their 3Ds's and the PS3.
However, even with those non-educational"" games they like to play, the LeapPads still get tons of use.
I love watching them play the games because I know they are also learning as they progress through each one.The LeapPad2 Power is identical to the original LeapPad 2 in every way.
There were no improvements to memory, processor, whatever.
This is totally fine as the LeapPad 2 was a huge improvement in speed and memory over the LeapPad 1.
The only differecne that the power has is that it comes bundled with a rechargeable battery pack which was originally only available for purchase as an aftermarket part.We purchased the pack for the origial LP2 and it works great.
The pack is not compatiable with the LP1 so we have been forced to change batteries constantly in that rather than just plug it in to charge.
I was lucky enough to get my hands on the Power which I have given to my oldest son who was using the LP1.
He was very excited because it is so much faster than his LP1.Setup is super easy especially if you already have a Leap Frog account.
I opened the software on my PC, connected the tablet and it was recognized.
I followed the prompts and it successfully updated.
My only issue was trying to figure out if I could transfer my sons progress on the games from his LP1 but I could not find a way to do that.
I was able to sync the apps I already purchased onto the Power for the most part but a few of them like the ultra e-books required me to remove them from the old device before adding them to the new one as I already was at the max allowable number of devices.So other than my son not being able to bring his progress over to the new LP, everything went smooth.
He played with it for about an hour before going to bed last night on one of the free apps you get to download when you purchase this.
My 6 year old daughter already had a leapster and I thought this was the same thing but because it looks more like a grownups tablet she likes it more.
I like the variety of apps and they aren't expensive and they are very educational.
Really nice product from a solid and reliable company.
I love the LeapPad2, we already own one and we love the affordable downloaded games that we can add to more than on device, and this Doc McStuffins design is pretty great too.
I hadn't had one of the LeapPad power devices before and I have to say it makes my opinion of the LeapPad that much higher, I think all the devices should come with the Power set.
Being able to plug the device in when the batteries get low is so much nicer than burning through four batteries at a time and trying to keep some charged at all times.
I love that it came with the $20 download card, we ended up getting a My Little Pony game and all of the kids love it boys and girls alike.
The extra stylus set is nice but we have had leappads before and never lost a stylus, and this one just made my kids want to change the color of the one on the device, which is no easy task, we ended up threading a bread tie through the string and pulling it through the spot for the stylus.
That issue alone is not enough to decrease the stars on this product, my kids have loved leappads for years now and even the older children that visit love to play on them, they are a long lasting toy for sure.
I really like LeapFrog products.
I wasn't sure at first, but after owning a LeapPad1, LeapPad2, and recently the LeapReader, I've been impressed with their learning power.
Plus, I find the company seems really interested and invested in creating toys kids enjoy and can really learn from.
That being said, I don't overload my kids LeapPads with lots of apps and game cartridges.
The few my boys have, they play with well enough, and really enjoy (Jewel Train has been the absolute favorite in our house).
I like that my kids have technology, but they need other tangible things (like books, manipulative toys, and the outside world) to learn from too.That being said, the LeapPad2 Power is a great addition to the LeapPad line.
Differences I found between the LeapPad2 and LeapPad2 Power were:-The color scheme is a bit different, more white than green like the original was.-New apps... Utility Suite that includes a calendar, calculator, notepad, clock, and stopwatch.
This was a nice bonus!
The Innotab came with a few of these apps on their tablet, and I always thought it was a nice touch.
I'm glad LeapFrog decided to add them to their LeapPad as standard apps.
Also, there's the LeapFrog Learning Songs app.-Recharchable battery with 9/hrs of battery life!
This is definitely what makes the LeapPad2 Power irresistible.
I was getting so tired of replacing batteries all the time.
We use rechargeable batteries, but still, given the way electronics work these days, life is simpler when you just need to plug a toy in to charge.
Plus 9 hours is heaven!Similarities between the LeapPad2 and LeapPad2 Power... we'll, that's pretty much everything else.
So not much to report here.Overall this is a great toy for kids.
My daughter has been using LeapPads since she was about 3.
One thing I can say about LeapPads is that the absence of WiFI is both an advantage and a disadvantage.
Being they are targeted for much smaller kids and primarily for education, without WiFI it is a safer device in terms of contents and the risk of getting viruses.
But without WiFI, it also limits the device's capability.
Specially annoying when you need to download a game or needs an update.
You will always need it to be plugged with a cable tethered to your PC.Difference between the regular LeapPad2 and LeapPad2 Power:- The biggest difference is the rechargeable batteries and AC power adapter- Calculator, Calendar, Note Pad and Clock.
My daughter is excited the most with the calc.Comes with:- MicroUSB cable- 2 styluses- AC adapter- Rechargeable batteriesPros:- No WiFI- Educational- Will also work with regular four double As- We have dropped it many times and still chugging-a-long- Rechargeable- Can play purchased movies from the LeapPad site.
She love the Barbie movies.Cons:- No WiFi- Disappointing battery life.
You will find charging it more often compared to an iPad or Nintendo handhelds- Downloading a game or an update is not user friendly.
Sometimes you would need to do it a few times and sometimes it would not even update.
