Reviews:
"My six-year-old has seen a handful of ""My Little Pony"" episodes, and I thought this would be a fun toy for her.
And indeed, there's a lot to appeal to little girls - a big 'ole mane of messy hair to comb, stickers, and a handful of phrases.
This particular ""Flip and Whirl Rainbow Dash"" pony has a unique feature, which reminds me a lot of my own childhood in the 1980s when my friends and I played with action figures that relied more on spring mechanisms than AA batteries.
You push the pony's legs down, wait a moment, and she flips over.
Allow plenty of space because the flipping can be a bit erratic.
She'll easily fall off a table or chair or down a stairwell, which is why my daughter typically uses our kitchen tile or entryway for this trick.A few reviews criticize the poor quality of this toy.
I did not notice any problems.
My daughter has played with this off and on for a week and a half now, and the pony still flips.
I have not counted, but I would estimate that it has been flipped twenty or so times, and it still works just as well as when we opened it.
And the pony still talks.
The hair is a horrendous mess, of course, and the tiny plastic comb doesn't help very much.
But as I recall, that's pretty much the way My Little Pony toys have always been.
Overall, she liked this doll, and from what I have seen, it's pretty fun in a retro 1980s sort of way."
The figure itself is nice enough.
And the comb is a good accessory.
My three year old daughter, who is way into all things My Little Pony right now, likes to brush the horse's hair.
The big problem with this toy, as others have mentioned in their reviews, is in the functionality where the toy is supposed to talk and move around.
Others complained that these functions stopped working for them a few days or weeks after they got the toy?
For us, it stopped after about 30 seconds.
Seriously, the toy was talking and moving when we pressed the button as we took it out of the box, but by the time we had it out it stopped doing any of that.
No good.
In my opinion the manufacturer needs to pull this product off the market and try again.
My almost 3 year old daughter is obsessed with this pony!
At first I thought it didn't work because it never landed on its feet.
But thanks to my amazing husband, he showed me I was doing it wrong!
Now 9/10 times she lands on her feet!
Super cool!
My Little Pony Flip and Whirl Rainbow Dash Fashion Doll Pet is well appreciated by my nearly six year old daughter.
We quite adore My Little Pony in our household and feel this toy is a fantastic bargain!
If you are giving this toy to a child as gift note that it does come with a demo battery (size AAA).
Fantastic if by chance you forget to gift a set of batteries with the toy for immediate play.
The battery is located on the back of the pony and is quite easy to replace with a Phillips or cross head screwdriver.On the compartment where the battery is stored there's a rubber lift flap which nicely keeps the screw hidden.On the left side of the pony, there's a button which can be pressed to make Rainbow Dash say a few phrases such as &#34;I'm Rainbow Dash!
Sit me down and watch me flip!&#34; & &#34;Want to see my awesome flip?
Ready Set Go!&#34; and a few other things.
Parents will appreciate that the toy doesn't constantly keep talking when being played with.The fashion part of this toy is neat yet the feature isn't quite long lasting.
The toy comes with a  rub-on design sheet to decorate her.
The images include multi-colored lighting, hearts, and her name &#34;Rainbow Dash&#34;.
To apply, you simply place the sheet over the area in which you'd like the image and rub the design on with comb handle that comes with the pony.
The design is pretty easy to apply but do know if the design placed upon the pony gets scratched, it won't look good and eventually come off completely.
The hair comb that comes with pony works well on the hair but I would suggest braiding the hair to prevent it from looking ratty and worn over time as with most toys with hair.The flip feature of this toy is pretty fun and works great if the pony is placed upon a completely flat surface.
My six year old daughter as well as my 3 year old son had no problem getting the pony to sitting position so the flip could be done.
I would say that 90% percent of the time the toy flips over and lands on her feet but the other 10% it falls over sideways.
We've had the toy for over a week or so and it's held up extremely well and we've yet to have to change the demo battery which comes with it.
My daughters, 7 and 11, are pony fanatics who own enormous bins of pony figures and regularly cruise local toy aisles to check for new pony merchandise.
Their constant complaint is the lack of new pony characters, including boy ponies, for imaginative play.
At some point, they started customizing their ponies with haircuts and Sharpies, because, who wants five different Pinkie Pies or Rainbow Dashes, whether glitter version, articulated, or not?
The ponies that most baffle them are these medium-sized ponies.
Are they designed for toddlers?
My 7-year-old renamed Flip and Whirl Rainbow Dash &#34;Rainbow Ouch.&#34;  It doesn't take long for a kid to tire of watching the pony repeating its same trick, launching itself like a weapon, and it's a matter of time before a kid starts to wonder if the toy can be used as a weapon and launched at someone, for an added twist.
&#34;Wanna see my awesome flip again?&#34; the voice repeats, and parents will say, Please, No!
It's less sonic boom and more sonic concussion for Rainbow Dash, and if you gave this toy to a toddler, she might pull the legs back into sitting position and inadvertently launch it someplace that will ouch.
It must be meant for toddlers, though, like really well-behaved or docile toddlers who will not tire of watching the pony flip, listening to her say, &#34;Wanna see my awesome flip again?&#34; and brushing her inaccurately-long mane.
We would rather see more standard-sized figures in a variety of characters for imaginative play!
As a mom of a child obsessed with My Little Pony, I was delighted that this option came available to me.
Instead of the standard non-action ponies, here we have a play toy of sorts.
Thanks to a homemade instruction video (to find it--search the you tube website), we knew that it was, indeed, possible to have our Rainbow Dash flip for joy, and we also had the expectation that we'd have to practice to get better at it.
Thankfully, the times she doesn't flip are made up for by the sheer joy of seeing her succeed!My daughter thought the rainbow wings were Super Awesome.
Durability...well it's got movable parts and a spring action.
The hair in all ponies tends to get a bit ratty.
The rub-ons are a fun little add-on that makes it just a little bit more special.I recommend this for any My Little Pony lover.
My daughter thought the rainbow wings were Super Awesome.
And it's a pony that they do not likely already have in their stock.Although I was able to get this item free, I do my best to be honest.
My daughter loves it, but only you know your child or the child you are buying for.
Or adult.
There seem to be a lot of adult My Little Pony lovers out there.
Certainly would be the hit of a child party, everyone taking turns to learn to get her to flip.
I won't lie, personally I don't love these hard plastic toys... but for whatever reason my 4yr old really does.
She has an absolute obsession with plush toys but has plenty of love left over for hard plastic ones as well, I suppose the rainbow main on this one doesn't hurt in the attraction either.First things first, throw away the decals or apply them when your child isn't looking.
They aren't stickers, they are like water slide decals and must be sort of rubbed on... a child can not do it, my 10yr old couldn't really do it, heck I even had some issues.
They also scratch off easily.
Save everyone some drama and throw them out.
It took my 4yr old a few tries to understand how to press the pony down correctly for her to flip, I was honestly afraid she'd break it and hoovered annoying over her showing her a few times... but once she got it she was fine.
The pony even flips and lands correctly on our carpeting which surprised me.
It's not too loud, or large, and it entertains my girls so I have no complaints.
Your MLP lover will be happy to add this to their collection.
My 9 year old likes ponies and he found all kinds of creative ways to play with Rainbow Dash, but she was a real hit with the 5 year old I babysit.
She seemed more interested in carrying her around and styling her hair than making her flip because it became apparent early on that the flip action isn't very reliable.
If it's on a smooth flat surface, it usually works, but not always.
If it's on carpet, it's really hit or miss, which I guess is to be expected.
The phrases and action gets boring really quickly, but she is very durable and well made and certainly has no shortage of cuteness.
The decals for designing her fell off almost immediately after putting them on, but she's still fun for little pony fans.
After reading the other reviews, I wasn't expecting much from this toy.
But my 7 year old just loves it.
What it does is very simple: you pull the legs up and set it down on a surface, push the button, and it utters one of several Rainbow Dash catchphrases, then flips up in the air.
My daughter says she's &#34;busting clouds.&#34; There are stickers you can rub on to decorate your Rainbow Dash figure.
She's a good size, nice and big, and my daughter actually has been carrying her around so Rainbow can &#34;keep her company.&#34; So I guess for this age group, it's a pretty cool toy.
My 7 year old didn't really care about this after initial opening.
Of course, that's not surprising with the kinds of toys typically played with.It was easy to open but the stickers were a bit of a pain.
I can see a younger kid having many more problems than we did getting them to stick and stay on.Ours flipped and landed upright approximately 1 out of every 4 times.
Not a bad ratio, really.
It was quite noisy when flipping but our dogs were interested!
The hair can be brushed, the wings can flap, the pony is a good size for little hands.All in all, perfect for 4 and 5 year old little girls that love Rainbow Dash!
Sometimes she doesn't land straight up.
Now I tried to get her to land on her feet but I couldn't.
My 5-year old could...some of the time.
That doesn't mean that she doesn't love this toy:  she does!
Big time!
She loved &#34;decorating&#34; her with the sticker tattoos but we haven't tried combing that long mane of hers yet.
She tried getting her to flip off of chairs, tables, the floor...you name it.
I would estimate that about 70% of the time she lands on her feet and the rest of the time she doesn't.
This doesn't seem to phase my daughter one bit though.
She still loves to play with this pony.
A nice addition to the toy chest.
My daughter LOVES anything that is MLP and rainbow dash is one of her favorites.
The accessories are neat, and I think she liked them more than the flipping, which lost interest quickly.
It takes a bit of strength to get it to flip and then you better move quickly.
For an adult it is not problem, but for a young child, it goes too fast.
Especially for my niece, it was frustrating.
She would try to set it just right and it would  kickoff.
She is a young, small, 6 and it was challenging for her.
My daughter had it a little easier, but it looks like she has more fun brushing her hair.
It is a cute toy, but I think interest will drop quickly.
Not enough phrases, and not really a lot to do.
Still, I think a younger child would like it if an adult could help set it up for the flips.
My 8 year old daughter loves this toy!
She is very much into My Little Pony and thinks the sayings are adorable.
It also includes batteries which is always a plus.The time between setting the legs and having the toy flip is  plenty long enough.
We had no problem setting her up and having successful flips on the table,  hard wood, and carpeted floors.The packaging does say 5 and up,  so yes as others have stated a toddler may not be able to successfully execute the trick.
Again my daughter has no issues getting the pony to flip without my help.Its a very pretty toy and goes great with all the other various sized ponys.
Would make a great gift for any MLP fan (5+ ofcourse).

There have been a number of reviews stating that the &#34;flipping ability&#34; of this toy isn't what it's made out to be.
After experimenting with it with my kids, we discovered that the pony absolutely must be sitting on it's rear end and back legs for it to work - and then it usually works perfectly.This chunky little toy (6&#34; x 6&#34; or so, roughly) talks and says My Little Pony stuff that means much more to my kids than me.
They enjoy it for that, but had the most fun applying the stickers.
These may take a little patience, as they're not peel-and-stick type stickers but instead the old rub-on decals that I remember from my early model-building days long ago.
A pencil will work fine, just be careful not to slip and draw on the pony instead.Playability?
It's like most, uh, &#34;one trick ponies&#34; - it does one thing well, so if your kid isn't in the mood to flip a pony, then this is just a static figure, and an oversize one at that, so it won't fit in with the smaller figures they likely have.
I officially felt old today when I turned to my wife and said, &#34;I don't get it.&#34;  This while watching our 4yo, going on an hour of playtime, still excitedly flipping her Rainbow Dash and introducing her to all the other My Little Ponies we have.
She could not have been happier, and when her (also 4yo) cousin came over, the two of them thought this flipping Rainbow Dash was the greatest thing ever.As a parent, I appreciate that it's significantly better-built than most toys seem to be these days.
Granted Rainbow's hair is a hot mess out of the box, but a hallmark of MLP has always been crazy hair for little girls to comb (this was true even way back in the 80's when my then-4yo sister was equally enamored of the original MLP's).
So while I, personally, wouldn't get much fun out of it, I also readily admit I'm not its target demographic.
For the two giggling girls in my living room this is a 5-star toy all the way.
Flip and Whirl Rainbow Dash was enjoyed by my almost-five-year-old daughter for a couple days.
While carefully pressing the legs back, the pony will do a flip and land on all fours.
Otherwise, its hair can be brushed.
There are rub-on graphics that are very difficult to apply with all the curved surfaces on the pony.
It's a fine toy, just pretty basic for the price.
When I saw these at the NY Toy Fair when they premiered, I immediately recognized the problem some people will have with her: you have to sit her down first to get her ready to flip.
That means you can use the whole body to easily push the leg springs in place - whereas, if you push her back/butt down, it's much harder to get those springs in place.This is from the Rainbow power line of ponies and has her special Rainbow Power wings (as seen in the last episode of this season).
As well, she has the decals for the special Rainbow Power symbols in the show.Rainbow Dash is the fastest horse in Equestria and so she gets the flipping motion.
I think she's good for a few times fun but my daughter, an avowed Rainbow Pony fan, did get bored of her pretty fast.
Once the flipping motion gets old, then you can push her cutie mark to get phrases.
But the phrases all relate to her jumping, which is an annoyance after the flipping action gets old.If your child loves MLP, they are going to want this and there's very little you can say to dissuade them.
She's the only pony on the market that really does some kind of action.
But also keep in mind that she is larger than the other ponies and so doesn't play well in sets.
The stickers and comb will keep kids entertained for a bit, but they'll be a little disappointed when they try the flip.
This little pony wasn't very coordinated.
She didn't seem to want to be too steady on hardwood floors or tables.
I'm thinking she would have likely done better on carpet.
She didn't always fall, but enough to where it got a little annoying.
From a kid's point of view, she still is a great toy to have and play with.
