Top sentence(s):
It is pretty small and does fly around the room at a good speed, so make sure you have a place to play where it won't get lost.
It was the little motorcycle that could.
What makes this one a little different though is it'll bounce out of corners and off walls and it can flip over and still go just fine.
It requires three AA batteries (not included) and a philips screwdriver.
4.5stars for sure!

Reviews:
First off this car requires 15 seconds of patience so young kids (4 and under) may not have patience for it.
My son is 5 and even for him it took him awhile to hold the car on the charger for the 15 seconds to charge it up.
Once charged you let it go, and it is a FAST little car that zooms around!
Beware it has a mind of its own!
The car runs for 15-20 seconds and then you need to charge it again.
For the price though, you can't expect it to have a battery that holds a big charge.
Charge it, let it go and repeat.
My boys 5 and 6 fight over this car and I think with multiple ones it'd would be really fun to watch them go and bounce off everything!
"This is what it says it is.
A ""motorcycle"" that you charge for a few minutes, let go, and then drives every which way crashing and flipping into everything until it runs out of power.
There is little educational value (perhaps a physics lesson if you try), but this feeds the joy of crashing that is dear to many a young child's heart.In this case it is for a 7 year old boy who spends many an hour pretending with motorcross toys and racecars and the like, having them crash and do stunts.
He loves this on its own (speed across the floor, hit the wall) or with other toys (set up some cars to crash into, other things to knock down, etc.
)Just be careful that this is in the room without all the nice stuff.
It isn't just the car that goes everywhere, but the child chasing it around that can cause some damage.Don't expect greatness here and you'll (or, rather, your child) should be very happy."
The Hot Wheels Stunt Chargers Motorcycles, Green was a lot of fun to play with.
It requires three AA batteries (not included) and a philips screwdriver.
The battery case is screwed down so that younger kids don't mess with the batteries.
The age suggested (5+) seems appropriate for the toy as there is a bit of dexterity involved in getting the motorcycle on the charger and holding it in place.
Once charged (about 20 seconds), the toys zips along and bounces off walls, baseboards and most objects in its way.
It was able to run on some of our rugs while other types stopped it in its tracks.
Make sure the floor is clean (our cat hairs got wrapped around the wheels and was a bit of a pain to remove between charges.)
The only problem was that we needed to chargers to keep the fun happening on both ends.
So we solved the problem by buying the second motorcycle and we can send them back and forth and crashing into one another and charge them separately so both of us are playing and no one is just passively sitting.
The motorcycles will turn into a modern day jousting event!
Lots of fun and I recommend the product but I recommend two if your child (or your inner child) wants to play with someone else.
my boys who are 7 and 6 really love this.
They are able to charge it up themselves and then let it go.
Boy does it go to bouncing and slamming off everything.
This motorcycle is very durable and lots of fun.
It is very easy to use and the kids have fun using it.
The only problems are the batteries run down fast(recommend Rechargeable ones) is you have to buy one for everyone.
"My 6-year-old daughter wanted to try out this car.
We put in the (three AAA) batteries and charged it for 20 seconds, then let it go, and... it was really unimpressive.
""Nonstop stunt action?""
Hardly.
But then I thought that maybe the batteries weren't as fresh as they could be.
I changed to three new ones, and ZOOM!
The motorcycle took off across the room and cracked us up.
It was the little motorcycle that could.
It rode over the rug, smacked into the door and rebounded, and all-around went crazy for 20 seconds.
(We timed it a couple of times.)
It's fast and funny action while it lasts, but it really does just last 20 seconds.
Then it slows way down and comes to a complete stop around 40 seconds, and you have to charge it again.
That gets tedious.The other problem is that my daughter has a hard time lining up the little tab on the motorcycle bottom with the slot on the charger.
It's tiny and requires decent motor skills to get it lined up.So it's a novel way to charge rather than the ""roll-back and go"" method, and it kind of looks like a crazy rodent when it's bumping around and rebounding all over the place, but three batteries is a bit much and the charging method is not my favorite."
I was not quite sure from the description what to expect, but this toy was a blast for my kids.
It is not an RC car or even a conventional battery operated toy.
The closest thing I can compare it to is those pull-back cars where you pull them back and they fly forward really fast.
Just the same effect on steroid.The base is the charger and it contains 3 AA batteries (sold separately, so don't forget them).
There is no on/off switch, but the two contacts to charge the motorcycle are concealed inside.
The motorcycle itself is a sealed unit - no user accessible batteries inside.
When you set the motorcycle on the charger, it pushes in a switch that makes the contacts move up and charge the toy.
As it charges, the wheels start to spin faster and faster while a green LED glows brighter and brighter.
In about 15 seconds, push it off onto the floor and the motorcycle will zip around the room bouncing off things for about 15-20 seconds.
It is fast, and I mean really fast.
We lost it as few times when it went under a pillow on the ground.
Each kid took turns charging it and letting it zip around.
I suspect if we had 2 or 3 of them, they would be good for races and crashing into each other.Lots of fun and highly recommended!
This is not the first charger vehicle toy.
I believe they had something like this for cars about 10 years ago.
Put the vehicle on the charge base, charge it for about 15 seconds, then let it zoom all over the place.The motorcycle is a pretty good vehicle for this type of toy because it's just 2 wheels connected by a body.
It will fly over the place and right itself.
A lot of fun at least.
But to make it more fun you have to build things for it to run off or make blocks for it to plow into.
This toy is only as fun as your imagination.
But overall, a neat gizmo.
Hot Wheels Stunt Chargers Motorcycles is a fun little toy (when fully charged) that will entertain for minutes at a time.
Be careful when playing with it because it will get lost in little niches and crevasses.
Another thing to watch out for is the charge time because it doesn't last that long.
When you get the motorcycle make sure you have three AA batteries and a tiny phillips head screwdriver.
But when it's charged, the motorcycle is a whole lot of fun.
IF your child has patience then they'll love this little racer.
"This is pretty similar to a lot of the typical ""charge-up"" cars that go shooting across the floor.
What makes this one a little different though is it'll bounce out of corners and off walls and it can flip over and still go just fine.
My son, of course, LOVES this thing.
It makes a bit of a racket, but it definitely keeps him entertained for lengthy periods of time.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is I really don't think it's worth the price they're asking for it.
Before seeing it, based on what it is, I would guess it'd be somewhere in the neighborhood of five to seven dollars.
Not 11+.
Yes, it's a cool toy, but it's not worth what they want you to pay for it."
I'll get the downsides out of the way first.
This little motorcycle uses 3 AAA batteries, so I advise getting some rechargeables.
It is pretty small and does fly around the room at a good speed, so make sure you have a place to play where it won't get lost.
It does take some maneuvering to charge it until you get used to it, and the charge only lasts for a short spurt of play.
On the plus side, my six year old grandson likes it very much and plays with it for long periods of time.
It is fun to watch it.
It would probably  be more fun to add another one to his collection, as the price is fair and he could play with his friends and brother.
My son thought this might be a little childish for him until he saw it go.
Batteries are not included, so make sure you have three triple A's available.
Charge it, point it and let it go nuts.
My son has put it up against everything, even down the stairs....still going.
Over the door jam, into the wall, under the sofa, you name it, he's done it.
The only real downside is that the charge doesn't last very long, so you'll be charging it a lot.
4.5stars for sure!
I also wish it looked a little better, but that's a personal thing....my son doesn't seem to care.
This is a smaller toy, that basically allows you to play for a few seconds at a time.
You have to keep charging the motorcycle each time you want it to go zooming.You charge the cycle on the base and then it go and the cycle takes off.
If it hits objects, it will flip and land and keep going etc.
It only goes for a few seconds though and I think we spent more time charging and then hunting for and retrieving the cycle under various pieces of furniture.My nephews seemed to really like it at first, since it does really take off pretty fast and they loved when it would crash and flip, but it seemed like after having to stretch under the sofa a few times as well as constantly holding the cycle on the charger for about 15-20 seconds at a time, they lost interest and did not feel like taking the time to charge.
Kids have trouble waiting in general - those 15/20 seconds can seem like an eternity... or at least enough time to decide they'd rather do something else.It is made well, I will say that.
I don't feel like the motorcycle will crack or break easily at all.
It is durable and built to handle all of the crashes and flips.
It also stay upright like it is supposed to and does not fall over on its side while zooming, unless it crashes first of course.
I would probably feel better about it if it were priced UNDER 10 bucks.
The fun only lasts so long, and you also have batteries to replace fairly quickly, so the cost really adds up over time.I give it 4 stars overall since it is built so well and it is fun for a little while .. until the kids get tired of charging.
This is a fun addition to the Hot Wheels group of vehicles.
This  works smoothly and well on the hot wheels tracks.This is very durable and expect it to hold up well through months/years of hard hitting play.Recommended.
A good value for the money.
"We own both this motorcycle version and the car version.
There's very little difference between the two-- basically, it is fun, but not a perfect toy.
I'll copy the  pros/cons that I wrote up for the car version here:Pros:-- Cars take very little time to charge.-- If you are lucky, the cars will crash but keep going, turning over to the other side and lasting until the charge is out.-- The cars can climb over some obstacles.Cons:-- Charge barely lasts.
It doesn't matter as much if you have a good course for it to ride on, but if it runs into something and you need to fix it, the charge will probably run too low or out and you'll need to recharge.-- It's very easy for the cars to get ""stuck"" on something-- a wall, a shoe, a foot, toys.-- It can be hard to charge.
My oldest doesn't have a problem getting it to line up and charge, but some kids might.If I had to choose between the car and the motorcycle, I'd say the motorcycle is slightly better.
I think that since it has only two wheels instead of 4, it just handles a bit better (especially flipping over when it hits something).
But it's not necessarily better enough that I would recommend it any more than the car version.Also, like I said in the review for the car version, the best ""track"" we made was in our (empty) plastic wading pool.
We could fill up the ""track"" with stones or sticks and leaves and it was a lot easier for the car/motorcycle to drive around for its full charge without running into anything that would stop it."
This little toy really books it's way around my hardwood floors and to my grandson's total laughing delight.
It seems to be made pretty sturdy and has wacked the walls a few times but with no damange to toy or wall.
The batteries are the only real drawback to this item.
Recommend getting rechargables if you're going to buy this for a special little someone you know.
The price is within a reasonable amount considering it really does work good but it comes from a company that does care about the quality of it's products and I think that makes a world of difference.
I am going to pick up a couple more for my grandson for Christmas since he enjoys them alot and the price is right.
These Hot Wheels Stunt Chargers Motorcycles are quite a bit of fun.
They're quite small but super fast.
So fast that it's actually kind of scary when they come flying towards.
I highly recommend having shoes on because it's difficult to get out of the way fast enough sometimes and if they hit you you're sure to feel it.
I also recommend not playing with these if you have pets near the play area for the same reason.
We have chihuahuas so if it hits them or other small pets it's probably not gonna feel very good.My 10-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter have a lot of fun playing with these.
They're very easy to charge and play with.
You simply hold the motorcycle on the charging station for about 10-15 seconds or so, set the motorcycle on the ground and watch it fly.
It'll zoom all over the place, bouncing and flipping as it bumps into something.
The charge will last for about 30-45 seconds and then you'll have to charge it up again.Since these are so small, it's easy for them to fly under object such as furniture and appliance so this could be a pain.
I usually recommend that my kids set up some type of blockade to prevent the motorcycles from going under certain items.Overall, we find these to be a lot of fun.
For short periods of time anyway.
I think must kids would enjoy one of these.
I would recommend them.
If I was a toy designer and I wanted to make a parent's life miserable, I would design a toy that is perfectly suited to go under any kitchen appliance or any furniture.
And it would need to be low to the ground, yet have enough velocity to go far enough to cause the most misery.Congratulations to Hot Wheels for solving this problem with Stunt Chargers.
It only took two times before this thing got stuck way under my refrigerator.
Thanks to Hot Wheels, I found things under there that, like Steven King's Pet Cemetery, are better left alone.
I spent 10 minutes sticking a rod under there trying to recover this thing to no avail, while finding things from previous tenants long past.
Strangely, it actually somehow ended up under the nearby oven.A trip under the couch was next but that wasn't nearly as bad.At least Hot Wheels could have made it possible to attach a Swiffer pad to this thing, with a string so I can recover it easily.
That I would give 5 stars.
But this one...no thank you.Also, charging this is difficult for a 6-year-old.
It wasn't clear how to do it.
You essentially jam it in until the charging prongs pop up and make contact with the two metal contacts.
And none of this is viewable, so you fiddle around until the wheels start turning.
Why the wheels are turning when we're trying to charge is beyond me.This is a loser of a toy.
