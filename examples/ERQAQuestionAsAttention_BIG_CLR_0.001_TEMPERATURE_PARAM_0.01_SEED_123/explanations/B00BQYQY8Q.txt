Top question(s):
How do you get the batwing to work?  That is the only piece that didn't work and I think it has something to do with the 2 red pieces strapped to Robin and Batman but can't figure out how to assemble them so the batwing will flip over.  Help?!  Or is mine just broken and need to be taken back?
can i use fisher price imaginext DC super freinds with this toy?
Top sentence(s):
My boys liked that this came with both batman and robin, and that both characters fit into the equipment/accessories.
As for usual Imginext has made a super fun and functional playset that my kids love.
It's much smaller than the last version of the BatcaveFisher-Price Imaginext DC Super Friends Batcave (Frustration-Free Packaging)but that's not necessarily a bad thing; really depends on how much room you want a Batcave to take up in your kid's toy space.It doesn't need batteries, all your kids need to add is imagination.
For some reason, I expected it to be much smaller.
You kids imagination is what the key is, and my son spent about an hour playing Batman and Robin the other day with this so yes, I was happy to keep him out of my hair for that long.

Questions:
Does anyone know what these two extra red pieces that were packed with the projectiles are for? I haven't been able to figure out where they go.
How difficult is it to put together?
Is this the most recent batcave?
age appropriate for 3.5?
How do you get the batwing to work?  That is the only piece that didn't work and I think it has something to do with the 2 red pieces strapped to Robin and Batman but can't figure out how to assemble them so the batwing will flip over.  Help?!  Or is mine just broken and need to be taken back?
Appropriate for a Batman granddaughter (turning 4, but with no iPhone), who's nuts about Batman? (I just don't "get" the mechanics/electronics)
can i use fisher price imaginext DC super freinds with this toy?
What size are the figures?  Can I add additional figures?

Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
My five year old son is a huge super hero fanatic, so he was ecstatic to receive this.
The Batcave comes with a Batman figure, a Robin figure, a Batcycle and a launcher with three bullets.
There are several really cool features such as a jail that pops open with the push of a button, as well as a Bat computer that opens and closes with a twist of an activation pad, but the thing that my son REALLY loves about this toy is the free interactive Batcave app specifically designed for this toy.
Using the iPad, you can select one of three missions to help Batman protect the Batcave from The Joker and his clowns.
Unfortunately, one of the three activation pads on our set doesn't work, so I deducted one star.
That being said, the Batcave app in addition to this super cool toy makes this a hit in our home!
This batcave provided hours of entertainment when my four-year-old nephew came over.
We played together for a bit, then he played on his own.
What I like about this toy is that there are no small parts relatively speaking.
Everything is on display and is part of the toy.Additionally, it was refreshing to see him play with toys rather than games on the computer and/or iPad.
If his imagination can be stimulated by this toy, and if he can be busy with it for a while - that makes the babysitting job that much easier!
I love Imaginext toys - we've never had any issues with their durability, and they make toys that are just plain fun.
This one is no different.
My kids LOVE the batcave!
It comes with a movable Batman and Robin.
You can move their arms, legs and heads, and if you stand them on the discs in the batcave, you can rotate them to open up doors.
There is also an arrow launcher for discouraging bad guys.This is about the size you'd expect from Imaginext toys - it takes up some room.
There is plenty of space for three children to huddle around and have a superhero adventure, but it does eat up space on the floor when play time is over.
Not much of a con, but it is a big toy.My children are 4 and 6, and they've spent hours with the batcave.
We've added in other superheroes and parked this next to Spider Man's Stunt City, and it has made all the difference on many a rainy day.
If your kids are superhero fans, I'd highly recommend the batcave!
It would be hard to create a toy that includes Batman, Robin, and a pretty cool rendition of the Batcave complete with moving parts and mess it up.
Fortunately, this toy is well made, has a ton of cool features, and is a good value for the price.
If your kids like Batman, get this for them.It's the Batcave .

I already owned the previous Batcave from Imaginext and while it was much taller than this one, the basic design and interactivity of this one holds its own.
There is a LOT to do on here for younger kids.
When you place the figures in certain spots and turn the knobs they are standing on it gives you nice surprises of expanding walkways and opening computers.
There is a cell for any baddies that you might own and want to throw in the mix.
It also comes with a Batcycle for Batman and Robin to ride.
While it's not as cool as the Batmobile, having SOME transportation is a nice bonus in this set.
There is no assembly required on this beyond one small plastic piece you can snap on, and it's rugged.
It's not unbreakable by any means, but it should hold up well to regular play.
This is a good toy because my sons can play with it at the same time.
Normally these serious of toys, regardless of the characters, often come with one figurine.
It's all part of the master plan for you to pay up for more accessories.In this case you get Batman, Robin, a motorcycle, and some arrows to shoot.
Plenty of things to manipulate.While the quality is better than most cheapo plastic toys today, it's not great.
So I took off a point.
But it fun and my boys like it.
It doesn't take up too much real estate either.
This Batcave set comes with Batman, Robin (it was hard for me to tell from the page details whether it included Robin or not), bat bike, batwing, flight suit and some projectiles.
It's a pretty cool set, I mean seriously, how cool is Batman anyway?It's a medium size as far as the Imaginext play sets go.
It's much smaller than the last version of the BatcaveFisher-Price Imaginext DC Super Friends Batcave (Frustration-Free Packaging)but that's not necessarily a bad thing; really depends on how much room you want a Batcave to take up in your kid's toy space.It doesn't need batteries, all your kids need to add is imagination.
We love Imaginext toys and have found all that we own to be very durable and good quality that hold up well.There is an app that you can download on your iPhone from the App Store.
Just type in Batcave in the search to find it.
The app works interactively with stickers that are on the Batcave.
My kids loved playing with it because they love anytime that they can play on Mom's phone.Now we just need to get some bad guys for the boys to throw into the jail.
They say they need somebody for Batman and Robin to arrest.
We already had the original Batcave so I was hesitant to pick up a second one, but I'm really glad I did.
My son actually prefers this one to the original.
There are tons of moving pieces and little surprises that will keep kids busy for a long time.
My son loved that the set came with both Batman and Robin and a motorcycle.
It really feels like you get everything you need to play without having to buy extra figures or vehicles.
I was also surprised by the size.
For some reason, I expected it to be much smaller.
It's actually a very good sized toy.
Fisher Price did a good job on this one and I would not hesitate to recommend it.
This batman cave is hands down our favorite imaginext set.
It is not too big (some of these things can get massive) and my 2.5 yr old can't get enough.
He will sit and play with the cave for hours.
Out of the 3 different sets we have, he goes to this one the most.
There was also a really cool interactive iPhone app that comes with it.
I've never seen anything like it, but my son loved it...and so did his Dad.
I really can't say enough good things about it.
This is one of the cheaper sets in the stores and we think it's the most fun!
It also came with a batman, robin, and motorcycle, which any of the imaginext characters can ride.
First and foremost, Amazon shipped fast, arrived undamaged, good job Amazon.
The Fisher-Price Super friends Batcave is an awesome toy if your kids love any of the superhero's these days.
Unpacking the toy can be a chore of course... with all the stuff tied together for security and safety reasons.
Once unpacked, its a decent size toy that you can shove in a corner when done.
It comes with Batman and Robin figures.
A cool littly motorcycle as well.
You kids imagination is what the key is, and my son spent about an hour playing Batman and Robin the other day with this so yes, I was happy to keep him out of my hair for that long.
For the price they are selling it, the quality can be a bit overpriced (about $5 to $10), so maybe wait for a small price drop.
Overall, highly recommend to anyone with kids who love this stuff.
The was a birthday present for the grandson who is now 8.
He loves anything Batman Imaginext.
This was no different.
The only complaint he had is that it did not come with the Joker.
To my surprise it did come with a Robin.
Under the description there was no Robin action figure mention.My grandson is very please with this newer version of the Batcave by Imaginext.
Might I mention he had the first one and wanted the second one this is my way of making up for that.
Every one is satisfied.Oh, I might also mention that  although he is very happy to have received this Batcave it is a bit of a downgrade from the first one due to the fact that it does not have all of it's original bells and whistles but some new ones have been added.
I do not believe that you little one will be in the least bit disappointed.
"We're fans of Imaginext sets around our house; they're sturdy, well-designed and offer plenty of opportunity for imaginative play.
This is no exception.
If you have no other Batman items in your household, this offers plenty to play with on its own, since it includes Batman and Robin (unless, that is, your child is old enough to ask for some villains for them to fight.)
There's plenty to do with the Batcave itself, and this has already provided for hours of playtime.The iPad/iPhone app designed to work with this Batcave is pretty cool.
We got a kick out of trying it out, though for the most part my son's played with this the traditional way - using imagination - and I'm all for that.Edit: this Mom has to admit it took me (and my child) awhile to realize the black Bat shape comes off its stand and clips on to Batman or Robin as the ""Batwing"" (hang glider.)
I really like Imaginext play sets, but I wish they'd come with a little more guidance in the way of instructions."
Yes, I'm a big Batman fan since childhood, and have been building a Batman legacy with my kids- well, sort of.
We already own another, bigger, Imaginext portion of the Batcave, and this is a nice addition.Although boyish in appearance, and the boys go for this right away, our girls ages 6 & 9 like playing with this as well.
It helps that they have Catwomen in their possesion(not included here).
They do include here Batman and Robin(small figures with articulated arms, legs and head) who insert into 3 circular stands that activate the cave's features- movable ramps, jail with bed.
There are also a arrow launcher, batwing, protective mask, and a motorcycle.I like how different compartments open up: the super computer with a Joker image, a sliding pole to move up and down 3 levels, a place to park the Batcycle and get out quickly and a drawbridge,  The outside of the cave shows bats.Our Batcave has just expanded and so has the fun.
My 7 year old absolutely loved this batcave when he first received it.
It basically came already assembled right out the box.
It comes with a few figurines.....batman, robin, and a motorcycle.
You can maneuver the figurines throughout the batcave doing a variety of stunts and activities.
My son loves the launcher!
This toy is very durable and I know it will last awhile.
My son's only complaint about this was the fact that it had no type of sound, if it would have came with some type of music or phrases installed then maybe it would have kept his attention a little bit longer.
This is defiantly geared towards younger kids....preferably ages 3-5.
"My boys have played with Imaginext play sets for many years, now, and this happens to be the third Batcave playset that we have owned.
We still own the previous two iterations, and they have held up well and still are played with on a weekly basis by my youngest son.
He played with all three, today, and with all on them side-by-side, it was easy to do a quick comparison between the three.This set is the smallest of the three, to be sure.
While it is still a cool set, its more diminutive size makes it less impressive than the other two.
Likewise, it looks less ""fortress-like"" than the other two.
While the previous versions looked like actual caves or secret bases, this one forgoes that design and instead goes for a full-on Batman, logo look.
It's completely obvious what it is, and while it is something new, it just isn't as cool as the other two.
This one has just as many moving parts (Boys LOVE gadgets and moving parts on their playsets!)
as the others, so no complaints, there.
And speaking of moving parts, the mini-figures in this set have more points of articulation!
In past sets, the mini-figures were pretty much two-piece molds that were pretty static.
Other than bending them at the waist or raising their arms up, you couldn't do much anything else with them.
These new figures are made with a different sort of plastic and are more articulated (you can now swivel their heads and wrists) and the sculpts are more detailed, as well.
The drawback to the increased articulation and sculpting detail is the less durable plastic that they are molded with.
My son's Batman character broke almost instantly (lost an arm), which took some of the fun out of his new toy.
The play set, as a whole, is a little less sturdy that past sets, too.All this being said, my son still likes this set, and your child would probably enjoy it, too.
As for usual Imginext has made a super fun and functional playset that my kids love.
This Super Friends Batcave has lots of neat features like movable parts, a containment cage/jail, and some flip open monitors.
My boys liked that this came with both batman and robin, and that both characters fit into the equipment/accessories.
There is just so much to do on this playset that I recommend it all the way 5 stars.
While I am not an expert, it looks like this is the third Imaginext Batcave.
While the other two (older versions?)
have more of a cave/rock look, this one is the Batman symbol without all the rock.
This version has characteristics of the other playsets (elevator, shooting gun and bat-motorcycle), but also looks smaller overall.
This set comes with two figures with the characteristic big boots look the Imaginext figures have.
Overall, this is a durable toy so it can take the use and abuse kids give their toys.
Any kid that likes Batman is going to want a Batcave, so this will be a hit for Batman fans.
"I received this Batcave through the Amazon Vine program and like all Imaginext toys, my 4 year old son absolutely loves it.
The play set is sturdy, built well and endures the battles he has with the super hero characters.
I wish Imaginext would include a villain with their products as they get a bit expensive to add on.
The play set has numerous Imaginext ""discs"" which are used to create interaction such as launching the Batwing or opening the Bat Computer.
My son plays with this, and all of his other sets constantly.
Like I said, Imaginext can get a bit pricey, but with all of the sets together, my son is enamored with the virtual world he can create with these."
Now this is a playset!
I received this new Batcave for my daughter through Amazon Vine.
She loves all things Batman, and is definitely pleased with our newest addition to her Imaginext super hero collection.Though nowhere near as tall as the previous Batcave, this one makes up for it's smaller size with it's big style.
Making it in the shape of a bat symbol was a really cool touch.This Batcave comes with a bat jetpack/glider that swivels up and around the top floor, a motorcycle that has little grooves to hold it in place, retractable walking paths that extend outward when the batcomputer is opened on the top floor, a jail, an elevator and a ramp that operates ike a drawbridge (it's the big gray rectangle in the picture).This playset is a lot of fun, looks great, has interesting features, and comes with a slightly different style of Batman and Robin.
If you have a little bat-fan in your home, they won't be disappointed by this toy!
"My son is really into super heroes and especially Batman because he has such a cool car.
So when I saw this toy I was pretty sure it would be a hit and I was right.
I gave this to my son about 2 weeks ago and he still plays with it several times a day.
He invents all these scenarios where Batman is after a bad guy and needs to go to his bat computer to track the villain.
He especially likes the launcher for firing projectiles at his target and then the jail where the bad guy can have a ""time out"" until he learns his lesson.
Altogether a fun toy with lots of room for imaginative play.
Super hero fans will enjoy it."
