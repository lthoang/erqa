Reviews:
My kids own all of the LeapFrog Leapster and LeapPad products.
I can honestly say that the newest generation, the LeapPad 2 is the best LeapFrog handheld device to date.
The first thing that I noticed when turning on the LeapPad 2 was the bright and high resolution display.
The screen looks great compared and has impressive clarity.I was also very pleased to learn that all of our existing games from the older system would work fine with this new system.
We have a pretty large library of LeapFrog games so it was important to use that the old games work in the new system.The LeapPad 2 has a nice camera that kids can use to take pictures and play games with.
My daughter absolutely loves the ability to take pictures of herself and her surrounding and then modify the pictures by adding frames and modifications.There is also a microphone so children can record themselves reading books that come on the LeapPad 2.
This is a really great feature that helps small children master reading.
I feel the educational value of the LeapPad 2 is very high overall.LeapFrog has put together another winner in their collection of learning devices.
"I put off getting the LeapPad when it came out last year because of the battery issue.
We have an Explorer with a recharger pack and that has saved us quite a lot in terms of replacing batteries.
I was very pleased to see that this version has a recharger available.
That will be purchased as soon as possible!
(Even though it's a little pricy for my taste, it's worth it in the long run.
)I was so happy to surprise my 5 year old with this.
He has been playing on the Explorer for 3 years now and it's getting a little worn out.
He was happy that the screen is larger.
I am happy that it has a front and back camera, a larger memory and that it came with 5 Leaplet games (4 preloaded and credit for one through the LeapStore).
I didn't have trouble downloading the games, but it did seen to take a while.
(That may have been because the 5 year old was jumping up and down next to the desk repeatedly asking ""is it done yet?
"")If you do not have a LeapFrog toy already, you will need to download the LeapFrog Connect Application.
This does take a while and it will periodically update when you plug your toy in to download for the Learning Path.
Just be patient.
It's a big file and that's just going to take time.There are many ways to play on this too.
You can tap with your finger or stylus.
I think this was such a neat idea to blend Monsters Inc. with a leap pad.
The gel skin with Mikey's giant eye was a big, big hit around our house.
I also love that it comes with extra stickers to personalize the pad.
As for the leap pad itself, I'm a big supporter.
I feel the learning games available have encouraged my children to practice writing, work through math problems and explore scientific concepts in a fun way.
Any game that sneaks in educational content while keeping that excitement is a big plus in my book.This Leap2 comes with a few extra apps, which honestly we don't often use.
There is now a calculator and a calendar, making the leap pad function a bit more like a smart phone, but apart from opening it up to see what it did, my four year old really doesn't need a calendar.
I do, however, like the app center card that came in the bundle.
While this won't buy many games, it will add 2-4 to your device depending on what you pick out.
There are a lot of interactive stories and games not available in stores as a cartridge that are available on the website.As for the device itself, it's the same great Leap2 that has been out this past year.
The screen is still pretty easy to scratch, even with gentle playing with the provided stylus.
And after watching my two children play with it, ages 4 and 6, I can tell you that with some games, they want to attack the screen with the stylus.
I think this would happen with any touch screen device.
My four year old started out just using her finger for a lot of the games, and really this works fine for most of them.
However, once she started playing the art studio and Mr. Pencil, she realized the stylus gives much better control.
I've noticed a change in how she holds a pencil when she writes after she started playing the Mr. Pencil game.
"This particular Leap Pad does not come with the rechargeable battery pack.
You will want to order that quickly, so you don't go through an inconceivable amount of batteries.
We already had one Leap Pad so we just pulled the rechargeable battery from it for awhile, since everyone wanted to play on this one instead.This Monsters University Leap Pad has the standard games that each one starts with, as well as a Cartoon Creator game my kids have loved, and the option to choose one of 4 free games online.
You will need to use the included USB cord to download the games to your computer, as it does not have wi-fi capabilities (a plus, in my book).The Monsters University Leap Pad also came with a $20 gift card for downloading apps, which enabled us to get an additional 3 games (it was a sale).
That's a nice bonus, but I'd have preferred having the battery pack.
What it basically means is that the higher price of the Monsters University Leap Pad is primarily going toward the Disney brand/design.Speaking of the Monsters University Theme, the Monsters University skin is primarily for style.
It's a thin rubber skin, and doesn't seem like it would provide any protection if the Leap Pad were dropped.
It just dresses up the Leap Pad a little.
Thankfully, it goes on easily, and comes off easily.
This is important if you're using AA batteries that need to be changed frequently.Because our computer has Windows XP we had to do an online search for ""Leap Pad Windows XP"" to find the right software for downloading games to our Leap Pad.
But it was easy to use after that.
Be prepared to add apps and games, which range from $10 - $25 each, as the kids may grow tired of the familiar games after awhile.My kids (age 3 through 12) all love the Leap Pad and we have had more than our share of discussions about whose turn it is.
It's a fun, compact educational toy that can be enjoyed at home, or on the road.
I especially like that earbuds or headphones can be added so that it can be used quietly.If your kids just love Monsters University and you're willing to pay a little more for the MU design, you'll be rewarded with the $20 app gift card.
If you're just looking for a Leap Pad for your family to start out with, you'd probably do better buying a plain one that includes the rechargeable battery pack."
If you've got a child you know how much they love your Smartphone or tablet.
But if you have kids like mine your tablet may have been... dropped down the stairs and now has a sizeable dent and a couple cracks on the side, for example.
(See my Nook for examples, unfortunately.)
So I'm reticent to allow the kids to play with the more expensive tablets and Smartphones because they are one drop away from ruining a $500 device.
But this device I can give them with no worries!
And they love it almost as much.What you get in the package is a LeapPad 2 with a relaly nice gel cover in the shape of Mike's head, a gift card to use at LeapFrog's website to buy a couple games, and a very small sheet of stickers.
The product is well designed and works well.
The touch screen is responsive and the games are educational and fun.
While the gel cover is no Otterbox it is definitely enough for this device as the device is thick and solidly made and the screen is not a full glass front like on a normal tablet.Earlier I said the kids love it ALMOST as much as a tablet.
That's the truth.
If your kids are used to playing games like Angry Birds, Temple Run, or Ski Patrol (and the like) then they will get bored with this after a bit.
The games here are learning games and creative games, which are cool, but are not fast paced or as much fun as the games available on iOS and Android.
I'm sure they will live without our Smartphones!One reason why you and I (as parents) will like it ALMOST as much as we like our tablets is that these games and apps are WAY more expensive than similar apps on Android or iOS.
In fact, most of my favorite educational apps on Android are $1-3 (or free on Amazon's store as the app of the day.)
But on LeapFrog's closed ecosystem you'll get games that are routinely $10-15!
They are easy to program, run on almost no memory, and have no business being that expensive.
"This is a special edition LeapPad 2 featuring Monsters University.
It comes with stickers(that should not be used on the screen of course), a $20 ""gift card"", cleaning cloth and gel skin.
The Leap pad is a cool blue color and you have several ""monsters university themed"" options for a screen saver.
I was surprised that it did NOT come with a monsters inc application.
In my opinion, it should have.Otherwise, the LeapPad 2 Monsters version is the same as the LeapPad 2. it has a front and rear facing camera, and comes with 9 apps.
One of these apps is one that you can choose.
Unfortunately, you can only choose one from a preset list.
Again, I'm not sure my the Monsters inc game was not an option.
The other included apps are Pet pad, art studio, photo lab, songs, calculator, calendar, note pad and clock.My 5 yo plays with this on most days.
We have an original LeapPad as well and it's nice that the games are interchangeable.The gel skin is quite cute.
I love Mike's retainer...cute.
The forward facing camera is an upgrade compared to the original LeapPad.The LeapPad is a great learning tool, however, the apps are quite expensive.
They range from $5-$20 per app.
An Ipad Mini might be a better investment for long term educational use.In general, this is a great learning device that keeps my son entertained while he is learning at the same time."
As a family that has grown up with Leapfrog toys, this is the best of the lot.
We started with theLittle Touch LeapPad, moved to the originalLeapPad Learning System, acquired a couple ofLeapFrog TAGpens, and have gone through many single purpose Leapfrog toys.
This is definitely my children's favorite.
Out of the box, the included apps have held their attention and imagination far longer than expected.
In particular, the cartoon maker and camera are big hits.I bought several cartridges, and they were excited to try them out.
So far, we haveSpongeBob SquarePants: The Clam Prix,Disney Fairies: Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure,I SPY Super Challenger Learning Game, andDisney Pixar Brave.
I like that these teach different subjects such as spelling (The Clam Prix), math (Tinkerbell), and science (Brave).
I haven't tried the others but I thought The Clam Prix was fun to play, almost like Mario Kart.Given a choice, my children would choose to play with a Nintendo DS or a tablet computer, but they will choose to play with the LeapPad 2 over any studying or practice.
That and the design and construction for smaller hands make me happy to let them play with it.
My son loves Monsters so he was thrilled to receive this Leap Pad with all of the Monsters accessories.We've always loved Leap Pad for our kids.
This one is a lot of fun with the camera, the games, and the educational value.
This has so many features my child enjoys.
Pictures, videos, motion sensing games, and plus he learns a lot.
Its just a lot of fun.Highly Recommended.
"My third grade daughter received this LeapPad 2 for Christmas and absolutely loves it!
It was her favorite gift for Christmas.As a parent, what I really enjoy about LeapFrog technologies are how easy they are to set up and use.
We connected the LeapPad to our laptop using the included USB cable and within ten minutes, we were off and running with it.
The Pad is also customizable to your child's learning level.
When you create the online profile for your child, you choose their age and grade, and the LeapPad presents them with content based on their age, engaging them at their educational level.The LeaoPad comes by default with these applications: Creativity (create your own cartoon sequence), Video and Camera (take your own pictures, make your own movies), Art Studio (draw and color), Music (learning music such as ""Punctuation"" and ""Sticky Icky Vowels""), My Stuff (where the pictures and movies are stored), My Books (no books are included by default, you need to purchase books), and one free game download, which you will install during the configuration process.
My daughter chose Roly Poly Picnic.The included cameras are both front and rear facing, so you can switch camera angles from the front to the back with a simple touch of the stylus.We already owned a pile of Leapster Explorer cartridges , and every single one worked with the new LeapPad 2.We owned several LeapFrog devices, and there were no conflicts with the software on the laptop, this new purchase was simply added to our account and we were able to quickly map our children's profiles to the new device.I am thoroughly satisfied with this new LeapFrog addition!For parents who do not enjoy ""noisy"" toys and games, consider purchasing headphones!
In the car, our daughter uses earphones with the LeapPad 2."
"Last year my boys got the LeapPad and ever since they have barely let it out of their hands.Some of my favorite features of the original LeapPad:Games compatible with Leapster Explorer and LeapPad (we have both so its nice not to buy different games)Ability to download games through an App store at reasonable pricesBuilt-in Camera and video recorderGood size for kids to play and hold in their handsStylus included and can be attached with stringThe new LeapPad 2 has all the above features and then some!Main differences between LeapPad 2 and LeapPad:Camera in Front and Back of LeapPad 2 (only 1 camera on back of LeapPad)Bigger Memory Size (4 GB compared to 2 GB)Recharger availableUp to 9 hrs.
of battery life (compared to only up to 8 hrs.
)Bigger Processor (550 Mhz vs. 393 Mhz.
)Since we have both I can compare them enough to say the new LeapPad is pretty sweet!
While I wouldn't replace your current LeapPad if it works just fine, the new LeapPad is definitely something to think about if you don't own one.
The changes are somewhat small but the two cameras is what does it for us.
My sons love taking pictures of themselves and it is much easier to take them with a front camera.
The memory size I am sure will come in handy too because we were getting to the point that we downloaded so many apps (average price $5) that we had to pick and choose what went on the device.
Not all of our apps fit on our old LeapPad so it is nice to fill up our new LeapPad 2 with some room to spare.
A quick thing on the apps too is that there is a good variety available including videos, games, ebooks and even some full cartridge games.
There is actually over a 100+ of cartridges and apps available to check out.I think LeapFrog has finally listened to parents too by making devices that use old games so you don't have to buy new games constantly.
Now don't get me wrong, there are new games out like ""Brave"" and ""Phineas & Ferb"" though to keep kids excited.
The processor is something I didn't necessarily notice the speed of, though that could be because my boys don't let me on it long enough to notice!Overall, we love the LeapPad 2.
It has everything I'd want in a tablet for my preschooler and it will grow with my child.
The recommend ages are 3-9 years old and my sons are 4 and 5, with no inkling that they are letting it go.
Now I will say I have a friend who her son thought it was too babyish compared to the Nintendo DS his older siblings had, but while it may seem babyish it is more than appropriate for kids.
This is such a fun special edition LeapPad 2.
Perfect for any Monsters University fans.
The colors are awesome.
So much cooler than the regular old LeapPad 2.
The Gel Skin is perfect for keeping it safe if it takes a tumble.
It comes with lots of cool extras including stickers and a cleaning cloth (Monsters Inc. themed of course).
My kids love their LeapPad 2, but playing on this one just seems extra special.
We are big LeapPad fans and this is just another top notch product from them.
If your kid likes Monsters Inc./Monsters University, get him or her this version of the LeapPad2.
If not, just get him or her the regular LeapPad2.
I have to say I was quite impressed with leadpad2.
First let's talk about material product itself.
It is a good size for the recommended - not too small and too big.
It is easy to operate and is attractive for kids.I really love that multiple accounts could be loaded onto the device - I have three kids and each has their own account and it works quite nice.The software preloaded and available for purchase are pretty high quality.
There are a lot of different levels available and this can be used as both a fun and a learning device.I have to say the LeapFrog brand has been producing some good educational games and this one tops them all for me.
For what it is I couldn't really find a negative.
Oh wait, it does go through batteries quickly.
Other than that it is a really neat toy.The included covering fits snugly over the device.
I do wish only the cover was Monster U so that even if a child stopped liking the character they could just get a plain cover and continue proudly caring it around.Here are the things we liked the most so far:Creating virtual petsMaking videos and taking picturesAll the writing and math games we have encountered thus far.Overall a really good toy for the 5 - 8 crowd.
We have the original Leapster Explorer and LeapPad and had been wanting to upgrade to the new LeapPad2 and couldn't resist when I saw the new Disney/Pixar Monster University bundle.
It's really cute.
The LeapPad itself is a blue color with Mike, Sully and Monster University graphics printed right on the front.
It comes with a Mike gel skin which is a really nice addition.
We bought one for our last LeapPad, it keeps the LeapPad from getting scratched and helps some with preventing damage from drops.
The gel skin is Mike's goofy one eye and face, totally cute.
It also comes with stickers and a cleaning cloth so they can wipe smears and smudges off.The only thing that I was disappointed with was that for a Monster University bundle, I expected that it would come with a Monster University game cartridge included.
Being a Monster University theme, you would sort of expect that but the only thing different about this one is the cosmetics of it and that it comes with Monsters University wallpapers already loaded which is nice but I still think it should include some Monsters University games or stories at least already loaded.It comes with a cord to attach to your computer so you can download additional content and the bundle does come with a $20 card for downloads.
You can use the LeapPad as it is but you get a free additional download with purchase anyway plus the $20 worth of downloads.
I got a total of 5 games and it ended up costing me a $1 after the free game and $20 credit.
You will want to do this over high speed internet so if you don't have it, I would suggest going somewhere with free Wifi.
This always takes a while for me and not the easiest operation to complete.It requires 4 AA batteries which are not included.
You will go through a pretty good bit of batteries so I suggest getting and using rechargeable ones.I love the kids having all their LeapFrog products.
They provide the kind of stimulation and fun that kids enjoy but yet they are still learning.
My boys are ages 6 and 8 and we still only do LeapFrog games and a few Wii games, no other types of video games for them yet.The LeapPad2 has both front and back cameras so the kids can take pictures and use the pictures in the apps that are included with the LeapPad.
It comes with several games and activities for the kids already loaded on it.
If you are looking for the basic LeapPad 2 for your child, this one is great!
It comes with the Mike silicone skin, stickers, a $20 LeapFrog App card, a screen wipe, and a blue LeapPad 2 with Sulley and Mike on the front.
If you are in the market for a LeapPad and trying to decide between this and the LeapPad Ultra, definitely go with the Ultra.
The Ultra has the plug in charger, bigger screen, and wifi capabilities.
However, if you are just looking for a LeapPad 2, this one was great!
My preschooler was so excited by Mike and Sulley, he can't get enough!
One bummer was that within 3 minutes of him using it, the stylus scratched the screen.
I guess it was just at the perfect angle, but it was disappointing to have it scratch so easily and quickly.
First, let's start with the Leappad 2 itself.
This is a huge improvement over the original Leappad.
The touch screen is more sensitive, it runs faster, it has better cameras.
Overall a better experience.
As for the Leapfrog software, that is still slow and clunky and annoying to use.Apps are another story.
While the apps are great, and many cartridges can no be downloaded, they are very pricey- especially when compared to iPad apps that can be just as educational.
The description says it comes with 10 apps, but most are the standard apps- notes, camera, art studio, etc.
Nothing special.
You can pick a free app from a selection in the App Store.
It would be nice if it came with a mini MU game on the device.Now onto the bundle.
This is a great bundle of you are getting the LeapPad 2 and want the accessories.
The case is similar to a gel iPhoto case.
It is protective and the Mike theme is great.
It is prone to picking up everything- hair, dust, etc.
Everything seems to stick to it.The stickers and wipes are great for kids,nothing  special though.
The $20 app card is great.
My kids have had the super-tough Leapsters for years, but this is our first foray into having a LeapPad.
The good news is that this gadget seems to be just as tough as the Leapster, which is important considering how often children can drop iPads/Kindles/Nooks/etc.Like they seem to do with all tablets, will figure out how to use the LeapPad quickly.
If you want to add to the pre-loaded apps the LeapPad comes with a $20 credit.
That's great, but do some careful shopping because the big name brand apps can cost more than that.
Besides the apps, there are built-in features such as the camera, the calender, a folder for books (none included), a folder for mp3s (you have to pay more the the mp3 player if you want to add your child's music).
Loading the LeapPad with a wide variety of activities, apps, music and more could get pricey.So, in short, the LeapPad is durable but you really need to look at other tablets and see if you want to buy a dedicated child-based tablet or an adult tablet that can be adapted to your child with much cheaper (or free) apps.
"My kids have had a LeapPad2 since last Christmas and really enjoy it.
When I saw the Monsters University bundle, I viewed it as an opportunity to prevent the ""it's my turn"" arguments.
Problem solved.
I'll briefly go over the LeapPad2 itself, but there are plenty of reviews for the tablet, so I'll focus primarily on the extra bundle items.TABLETThe LeapPad2 is a nice kid-friendly tablet.
It has front and rear-facing cameras, no connection to the Internet (a positive for me) and runs on 4 AA batteries.
There is another version of the LeapPad2 that comes with rechargeable batteries, but I just use 4 AA Eneloop batteries and it works perfectly.
There's also an Ultra version of the LeapPad with Wi-Fi, but I don't know much about it.
I think for the intended age group, 3-9 years, the LeapPad2 is a good fit.
It's durable, offers a decent selection of educational and entertaining apps, while being a pretty good value.
The LeapFrog Connect desktop software, on the other hand, can be very finicky.
Fortunately, I don't need to connect the LeapPad2 to my computer all that often.BUNDLEThe bundled LeapPad2 hardware has a glossy finish, which is different than the one we got in December.
The Disney Princess version we have has a matte finish.Gel skin:The gel skin looked like it might be made out of TPU, which would've made it sturdier, but it's actually silicone.
Silicone is a lot softer and more pliable.
I generally don't like silicone cases, but a TPU case probably would've been too hard put on and remove.
You need easy access to the back, where the battery doors are located, so I guess the silicone material makes more sense.
Instead of the gel skin, though, I would've preferred the zippered hard shell case that came with our Princess bundle.Stickers:The bundle includes two identical sticker sheets of Monsters University characters.Apps:It also comes with nine apps, one of which you choose between three possible apps.
Nothing compares to Leapfrog when it comes to educational toys!
We have had their videos and toys, and they practically taught my older daughter to read.I love the fact that this LeapPad has a Monster's Inc. theme as my kids, having just seen the  movie, will find that appealing.As other reviewers have noted, the apps for this item are pretty expensive.
I have an iPad as well, and there are many educational apps on the iPad that are free or inexpensive.
That being said, the iPad is much more expensive (and less durable) as well, so you have to weigh that into your decision as well.
This LeapPad2 tablet themed around Monsters University is super cool.
Seriously, I love it!
If you're going to get your kid any sort of tablet like device, this is the most appropriate choice.
Within this kit, you get: an adorable tear-resistant gel skin, 2 scary-silly sticker sheets, a cleaning cloth, and a $20 Digital Download card.
It is also loaded with special Monsters University wallpapers.
For charging, you get a USB cord.As far as durability, this is something that I wouldn't be worried giving to a young kid.
The skin adds even more durability and allows for a nice, easy grip.
The screen is solid and should take plenty of play before it starts to wear.
While young kids (the two year old set) might have trouble holding this, my 5 and 6 year old kid testers had no trouble holding it and using the stylus.The choice of games available for this system is vast and diverse.
While we found the games to be the most fun, you can also download learning videos and music.
This unit has a camera that shoots both front and back, so there are also a number of apps that deal with creative photography.
Apps are (for the most part) appropriately priced.
With the giftcard you receive with this package, we were able to purchase 3 apps to attach to this unit, which is pretty good for the amount on the card!My kid testers picked this up straight away when they noticed it.
And you know what?
They really enjoyed it.
Now that we have more apps on it, I look forward to seeing what they think!
This LeapPad2 is just amazing.
The Monsters theme is really appealing to children (and adults).
I especially like that the case has textures, which makes it much easier to hold on to.The most important reason I love LeapPads is because of their educational apps.
One of the amazing benefits to any of the LeapPads is the number of apps that come preinstalled.
There are plenty of games to play - enough to keep a child challenged for months.
I see a lot of very small children playing with iPads and as an educator; I'm not sure what benefit they have.
Obviously once children are in the upper elementary, iPads become valuable tools to use for education.
But up until that point it seems like the educational adaptation is pretty hit or miss.
The teenagers who have been in my house the past few years are crazy in love with their iPads but they are playing games.I now regret all of my complaints about the lack of color involved in the Leap Pads.
The green or pink and maybe a lavender cover made it difficult to tell which LeapPad was which.
There will be no mistaking that this one is mine.
:D.  Actually, when the children are playing, they have 15 minutes on one device and then they all switch because not all of our LeapPads have the same content.
Then they go out to play because it is still summer here and beautiful.
But now it is easier to make sure they have switched LeapPads because they are not all green.The only complaint I have left is the inability to download purchased apps onto more than one LeapPad.
The LeapPad Ultra did allow me to connect and download apps I had purchased previously.I did have some runarounds with this particular LeapPad.
I have an account with a huge number of LeapFrog products attached to it and sometimes they are easy to connect and sometimes not.
"I am reviewing this as someone who has previously given their kids the first generation leappad, and also a first generation 7"" Galaxy tablet.
So my review will draw off of those two products and my experiences as a parent who has given these to their kids to play with.Battery/LongevityThe first generation Leappad was cool and all but it was a battery hog.
Neither it nor this recent edition come with an AC cord (although there is a spot to plug one in) but we eventually found a cord to use with it so it could be used sans batteries.
But when we went to using it with the plug, we found that it didn't get used much as with the batteries... because it wasn't as mobile.
Kids like to go outside with it, or move around to different rooms at will.
The same is going to be true with this new LeapPad.
Batteries lasted one day (with regular use playing videos and Ebooks mostly).
So we'll be plugging this in a lot.
In this arena the tablet beats the Leap pad because of the battery life and the fact that it recharges.AppsThe apps for the leappad are all educational.
You know you aren't going to get anything questionable.
They are categorized well and you know what you are getting.
With the tablet, it's a little more of a gamble and you often need to try out apps before letting your kid see them.
From this standpoint I'll give the nod to the leappad, although the tablet has access to many more variety of apps.Ease of use/uploading apps:You have to connect the leappad to the computer to transfer data and upload new apps and such.
This was kind of a pain in the butt.
The tablet is much easier.
Since we'd had the first generation leappad...
My wife was setting this up on her computer when my 4 year old daughter caught her doing it.
From that point on, my daughter and 7 year old son have been using this thing from sun up to sunset both arguing who gets it next.
They love the games that it come with it as well as the add-on games you can get via download.
So far, it seems very educational, and after a week of play, very fun.
This is the first time in the history of toys that my kids havent been bored within the first few hours of having something.
Suffice it to say, we all love the LeapPad2 just not the fighting.
LeapFrog's LeapPad2 is a slightly beefier version of the original LeapPad, but it still falls way behind most other tablets in graphics, screen size, accuracy and features.
However, it's one major redeeming quality is that it is durable.
My 3 year old is pretty good at handling electronics gently, but I would still be hesitant to risk $500 on her taking care with an iPad.
The LeapPad2 can take a lot of abuse though and I don't even have to worry about my 1 year old getting her hands (and much more) on it.
While the tablet itself is cheaper than most other tablets, the software is much, much more expensive.
Don't make a decision based primarily on the cost of the hardware.As for the LeapPad2 Monster University Varisty Edition vs. the regular LeapPad bundle, you are paying a decent amount for some trivial bonuses.
The most significant item bundled in with the LeapPad2 is the $20 credit for LeapFrog's app store.
It's generally better to have $20 to spend on Amazon because LeapFrog software will be cheaper on here.
However, currently LeapFrog is giving 30% off your first purchase on their store.
The stickers, cleaning cloth and bonus software included in the bundle may be fun for your kid or not.
The protective cover looks nice and may add some probably unneeded extra protection.
In other words, if your kid loves Monsters University, it may be worth purchasing this bundle, but don't think that you are getting a bunch of great items bundled in for all that extra cash.
"My three-year-old absolutely loves His Monsters University LeapPad2.
Because the protective skin for the LeapPad bears the eye of Monsters Inc character Mike, he likes to call it his ""Eye iPad,"" and he loves that he's got something of his own, in just his size, that allows him to play electronic learning games like older kids do.
If he had to rate this device, he'd probably give it 10 stars.
As the person who is responsible for purchasing apps and monitoring his game play, I've got a few more considerations to take in mind and can give this a very solid 4-stars.
I'd give it a 4.5 if I could.The LeapPad2 bundle comes with $20 in credit good at the LeapFrog site.
Some apps tend to be quite expensive.
Many of the more popular character-based games and apps run around $25 each.
Simpler games that use the LeapFrog characters, Violet and Scout, can be had in the $5-$15 range.
Finding apps for a 3-year-old can be a bit challenging.
My son would be happy to play the same game over and over and over again.
And while I recognize that repetition is an important component of learning, I'd like for him to have more choices about games.
But the majority of apps available for the three year-old set are videos.
I'm sure this would be just fine for some, but as we limit both his TV and electronic device time, I don't want to have them just become one big babysitter.
The great thing is you're not limited to apps with the LeapPad Ultra; you can also purchase game cartridges (though I'd get these directly from Amazon or a brick-and-mortar store before getting them directly from LeapFrog).
My son's current favorite isLeapFrog Disney Doc McStuffins Learning Game (works with LeapPad Tablets and Leapster GS), which is a great game for three year olds because it centers around something they all love--toys!Most of the LeapPad games require players to listen to verbal commands, so I don't recommend this for kids younger than three.
We got this bundle when my son was a few months shy of three, and it's remarkable the difference between the directions he was able to follow then versus now.
"With an iPad at home, it's often frustrating for everyone to share it - the kids want to play games on it, I want to get work done on it, and no matter how hard we try, invariably someone ends up getting upset.
The LeapPad2 is a good starter tablet for younger kids to play with instead of your electronics.
The apps on here are geared towards kids and educational, the unit is bright and appealing to play with, and for the most part it keeps our kids happily busy.THE TABLET ITSELF - With a 5"" screen that's larger than my iPhone 5, but smaller than some Samsung cell phones, the screen is a good size for kids to explore and play on.
The display is bright, the sound is very clear on the unit, and the chunky feel of the unit makes it great for younger kids.
The plastic is durable and will definitely survive a drop.
Things I really like about the tablet itself is that the stylus is tied to the unit, so there's less chance of it getting lost, and that the battery accesses are not screwed down.
I hate having to find a screwdriver to open the battery case!
The stylus doesn't always stay in the stylus holder as it's held in magnetically, but since it's tied to the unit, it all good.
The touchscreen of the LeapPad is also very responsive.
Added bonus - there is a motion detector in the unit, so it does respond via movement like some iPad/iPhone games.CAMERA - The resolution of the camera isn't great, but it keeps my kids happy.
With a camera on the front of the unit, and on the back of the unit, it works similarly to an iPhone.
The resolution is far from printable, nowhere near the resolution of my crappy old cell phone, but boy - the kids LOVE this thing.
I have to note that the camera lenses are kept fairly safe as they are ""sunk into"" the unit, unlike your standard iPhone or iPad camera.APPS - This unit does comes with 10 apps, but this doesn't mean that it comes with 10 apps that your kids will play with.
The apps include Pet Pad, Camera, MyStuff, My Books, Music, Calculator, Calendar, Clock, Notepad, and one app of your choice.
This is where things irritate me about the LeapPad.
There's only 2 apps your kids will be able to play with off the bat.
What makes the Monsters University bundle different than the standard LeapPad2?
Accessories and bonus content such as the thick gel cover which depicts Mike with the rear camera opening in his eye... very cute.
The cover is practical as a protector as well as being attractive, likewise the cleaning cloth is cute and useful.
You can customize the LeapPad with your choice of Monsters University wallpapers.
The $20 download card to get extra content online is the icing on the cake and great addition to the package if you are giving as a gift.The LeapPad2 is a terrific kid's educational tablet.
It really does a great job of combining learning and fun for kids aged about 4 through 9.
There are games/apps with different themes such as creativity, science, math, spelling, music, ebooks and some just for fun.
You may download playable material online or buy cartridges for the games.
I would recommend you also get yourself a powerpack so that you can recharge the device rather than going through a ton of batteries.I highly recommend this learning toy.
This is an upgrade from Leappad 1 at our house.
Last years model still going strong but some new features make this a hit.
We like to have educational toys that are also fun in our home.
This pad is very durable and takes pretty much what the 4 yr old dishes out.
The bright blue and green colors are great for both boys and girls.There is a camera front and back facing.
These are not high quality but to the kids they are a lot of fun.
Taking a picture of yourself making faces that is worth hours of fun.You get a $20 gift card for online game purchase but don't count on that buying a lot.
All of your past purchases are compatable with this pad.
Update Oct 7, 2013 forgot to mention you get a 30% discount on your first purchase so The $20 goes further.
I got 3 programs and still have a $2.50 credit to the account.
It is off your whole order.Art Studio and the Creativity Bundle are the favorites here.The one thing that was a disappointment was this one takes  4 AA batteries and depending on how much play in a day that can be one day.
We go with recharagables so there are always some ready.It also comes with stickers to decorate the pad or other items the child may want to use them on.
This with he DVD at Christmas if it is out would be a wow gift.
Little ones see adults with tablets and want them but the 4 and 5 yr olds still need sturdy toys and you have to set up lots of parental controls to keep them safe.
There are no worries with this you set the tablet up on the computer make purchases then the child can do anything on the pad.You get a 1 year warranty at this price point I was glad to see that.
"I've been thoroughly impressed with our Leappad 2.
My son had no trouble at all learning to use the tablet even a couple of months after his 3rd birthday, although most of the games are designed for children 4 and up.
I thought he might not like a tablet for kids, since he's been allowed to borrow Kindles and iPads, but it's proved to be very entertaining.
The games and ebooks we've tried are fun but with a pretty strong educational component.
I'm a huge advocate of limiting ""screen time"" for kids, but the learning and interactive aspects of the games make me feel good about letting him use these games in appropriate doses.
Although he's a pretty careful guy, he is three and so far the Leappad has withstood the normal wear and tear with flying colors.The only drawback I see is the price of additional games, but they do seem to be pretty high quality, with enough content to be interesting for quite awhile.I did receive our Leappad 2 free as a part of the Vine program in order to review a specific game.
However, I did not have to write this review of the Leappad itself, and the opinions are all mine."
LeapFrog LeapPad2 Explorer, Green.
It was a little difficult to get it out of the box.
The instructions said to put batteries in before beginning but the batteries were already there.
It was easy to use the quick start guide for the computer, but it was very confusing trying to register it because Leap Pad 2 was not listed.
I choose explorer, not sure if it registered.
Our grand daughter 6 and grand son 4 played with it all day.
They were learning math, science, reading and art without evening knowing it and liking it.It is great that each child had there own sign in spot.
My husband and I even tried it and liked it.
We had one problem with it at the end of the day, the pad locked up and sometimes would open up some other tab you didn't touch.
This problem was quickly solved by going to the parent controls and resetting it.
The family was happy again.
"I have to say that this is one of the best ""toys"" around!
Although the camera isn't something that you would find in a high dollar camera, but it serves it's purpose and makes my daughter happy.
She has a lot of fun taking random pictures everywhere.The games/apps are really fun, also.
They keep her occupied for hours.
I have to sometimes take it away, so she'll play with other things or outside.This DOES NOT come with a rechargeable battery.
I wish it did!
Batteries are so expensive, especially when you have to keep changing them.
That gets really annoying.
Invest in the rechargeable battery pack...it will be WELL worth the cost.Overall, this is a WONDERFUL toy.
It can be fun and educational all at the same time.
The Monster's University pack is also great!
I think it's well worth the price!"
This is a great toy for kids under the age of 8.
There is a whole world out there of iPads, ipod touch which maybe too advanced and less educational for the younger kids.
That is where the Leapfrog has always excelled.
The games are fun to play but getting more apps does cost money and can be quite pricey.
This is why I took away a star because the attention span with this product maybe limited and with some of the apps being expensive, it may not be the best option for parents.
It also isn't as intuitive for the younger kids and they may get frustrated after a while.
I think it's a great concept but should be priced lower and have more options with cheaper apps.
