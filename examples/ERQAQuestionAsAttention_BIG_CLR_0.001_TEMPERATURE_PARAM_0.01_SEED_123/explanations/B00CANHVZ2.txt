putting it together.
A little more attention to the quality of the build, and Kre-o can have something really good going here.
KRE-O pieces can be mixed with LEGO pieces and cost a lot less.

Reviews:
It took us about an hour and a half to put the castle set together.
That included a large portion of time for sorting the pieces.
They are not organized into bags that make sense.
You have to open every bag and sort every piece before you can begin.
Luckily, the box opens up enough to give room for doing this.The instructions are easy to follow and move in a fairly easy progression of building The only thing I advise different from the instructions is to put the sticker on the base with the battery pack before you start building.
(Just look ahead in the booklet to find this step.)
It wasn't hard to put it on but it would have been much easier if the sticker was applied before the pack was put on the base plate.All in all, it's a decent toy.
I'm having trouble getting the pieces to stay together, but that seems to be a problem with KRE-O as we have tried their sets before and had trouble getting them to stay.
I personally got confused on two steps of the construction, but that may have been just me since I had a little boy in each ear asking me what I was doing and where it would go and how much longer until they could play...The &#34;music&#34; and sounds are not really scary.
Just a spooky laugh, wind and thunder.My issue (and reason for decreased stars) is that the &#34;motion blocks&#34; do not move when we turn the &#34;sonic motion&#34; brick on.
A little disappointed in that since it looked like that would have been fun.
They're still playing with it though so I'm not completely disappointed.
It is small when constructed.
From table top to top of the castle is just over 7 inches and the Kreon figures are tiny compared to the figurines from other block construction sets.
When it comes to building block playsets, you can't help but compare everyone to Lego.
They own the space, and with good reason.
Simply put, they are the bar that everyone will be measured against.
That's not to say that you can't put out a quality set if you're not Lego.
So with that in mind, my son and I set out to tackle the Kreo Haunted Hideaway.
Right off the bat, I couldn't help but think of theLEGO Monster Fighters Vampyre Castle 9468.
That set is usually well over a hundred dollars.
This is one is significantly less.
And you can immediately see why.The mini figs are terrible.
Forget Lego.
Kreo has done much better minifigs.
For example just look at the figures in theHasbro KRE O Battleship Combat Chopper Playsetset.
Its clear that they can make a decent minifig.
The characters included in this particular set are based around a one block wide model.
Seriously reduced articulation and not much fun to play with.
But maybe thats because of the sonic motion gimmick.
So when we think of plastic construction toys, Lego is probably the first thing to come to mind.
They were the first and probably still considered the best as far as quality and availability, but Kre-o by Hasbro is up and coming and doing pretty well with licensing some of its other toy lines within the Kre-O universe.UNBOXING:The KRE-O CityVille Invasion Haunted Hideaway Set (A3247) comes in a 16.5&#34; x 11.5&#34; x 2&#34; box with handle.
It weighs less than 1 lb.
The box looks gimmicky, with one end coming to a triangular edge.
I can't really see the point of it from a cost savings view, but it does give it a style that makes you double-take when it's sitting on a shelf.
Also, the box, if opened correctly can be reused as a block container/travel box.
It comes with 317 pieces, including 5 Kreons, a sonic motion brick, and 3 motion slider bricks.
Also included are a couple sticker sheets, instructions, and a downloadable app game card.
You will need to provide 3 AAA batteries to this set.REVIEW:The Kre-O bricks are somewhat cheaper looking/feeling than Legos.
The Kre-O bricks don't have any small etched &#34;Kre-O&#34; on all the pegs as Lego bricks do.
Also, each brick has one or more pegs that have been hollowed out.
I'm not really sure what the purpose of that is, other than to distinguish them from Lego or Megablocks.
Each Kreon is poly-bagged by itself, which is nice.However, the rest of the bricks are randomized in different bags, unlike Lego which numbers their bags to make for easier building.
Kre-O makes the bags unnecessary in their directions because the pictures show to open each bag; then dump all the contents into the box; then re-distribute all the bricks according to color before starting to build.
WHAT?!?
The instructions are ridiculous.
I have two children and a houseful of Lego bricks.
Years ago, after a miserable experience with a Mega Bloks building set, I swore I would never buy anything but Lego again.
The great reviews from others about KRE-O, however, gave me hope, and I decided to give this set a try.
I'm so glad I did... it's wonderful!This set builds a little vampire castle, and includes vampire and human minifigures.
The design is very cute, the instructions are detailed and clear, and the bricks themselves are made of a high-quality plastic - reasonably comparable to modern Lego.
Even better, the set includes sound effects, and a cool vibration-based motion technology that makes it extra fun to play with once it's built.
All this for way less than a similarly-sized Lego set would cost... overall, a very nice, frustration-free building set recommended for any little ones who like to build and play!
This is our second set of KRE-O's, and the boys thought it was fun to put together and play with.
The little monsters and their sounds make this a great set to play with once it is assembled.
Like our other KRE-O set this one too has a lot of very tiny pieces, which is why we gave it four stars.
KRE-O pieces can be mixed with LEGO pieces and cost a lot less.
When I gave this to my nine-year-old LEGO-fan son, he looked at the box with interest and then noticed the brand, saying &#34;I've never heard of KRE-O.&#34;  Nevertheless, he was intrigued by some of the product features and started building it that night.
Just as with LEGOs, everything snapped together nicely.
A pretty cool aspect of the Haunted Hideaway--and something I haven't seen  in any LEGO set--is the motion brick.
When you turn on the battery-operated platform, a slight vibration causes the KRE-O characters on the bricks to move.
My son and I were quite impressed because the characters moved forward in a line rather than just shaking about whatever positions they started in.
The motion technology is akin to--and an improvement on--the old-school vibrating football field, such as the Official NFL Super Bowl Electronic Football Game.
All in all, a good set that my son enjoyed assembling and playing with.
"After I opened the box and assessed the contents and handled a number of the pieces by putting together one of the little characters, the first thing I noted was that they are tiny!
I mean teensy, weensy, itty bitty.
I took some photos and, if Mamazon will allow, I will upload a couple.
(An assembled figure was about the size of a push pin.
)Now, I realize that the toy is for children with small hands, but the resulting ""toy"" they have to actually play with after building is complete is going to be pretty small.Then this product was turned over to my 7-year-old grandson for real life testing with a real, live kid.His Dad reports that he took it home and spent pretty much every waking moment (when not in school, at baseball practice, doing homework, etc.)
putting it together.
He used the enclosed instructions and almost never asked for assistance.
He really ""worked"" at it and seemed to really enjoy it.
It took four days.Once it was together, he simply lost interest and paid no further attention to it.I waited two weeks and then asked the Grandboy how he liked it.
His report, ""It's OK."" When I asked if he plays with it, he looked puzzled and then said, ""No.
It's finished.
""So, my conclusion is that, for some children at least, the value in the toy will be in the assembling, not in the playing-with."
The CityVille Haunted Hideaway is a surprisingly intricate scene with a lot of detail.
Three 9 and 10 year olds put the set together on a weekend.
The set features spooky sounds and three motion bricks to make the set come &#34;alive&#34;, so to speak after it is constructed, which is a nice feature to prolong the interest in a constructed set.
The kids liked the Kreon figures Baron Batcakes and Skeletron most.However, surprisingly, they were less interested in playing with this set after it was completed than some of the others they usewhen they play together.
I think the nature of the set lends itself to tie-ins with Halloween and/or when kids are more into monsters.
Overall, they enjoyed constructing the set and managed to get all the small pieces together with a minimum of help and they did play with it for a while.
If your kids like a monsters, haunted theme it is a good solid, detailed set they should enjoy.
I did not think I would like Kre-o as much as LEGO, but not only do I think it compares as almost as fun but so does my son.
The moving parts are what he was excited about, and I thought was fair but the colors and theme is what I loved.
He loved the vampire men and it was easy to put together, though the friction part works only sometimes.
The single most important thing about this toy is that it is affordable unlike Lego and Lego pieces fit with the Kre-o.
Love it.
I was hesitant to get this set because the last set we had was nearly impossible to put together.
Once it was put together it would fall apart easily.
I was pleasantly surprised to find my 9 year old son had no problem putting this set together and keeping it that way.
He was entertained and not frustrated.
He was thrilled with the sound effects and electronics as well.
This is a good set for the price and a nice step away from other similar brands.
My 4 year old was also easily able to get it on the building fun.
I'd definitely recommend this toy if you have a building enthusiast in your house, no matter their age!
My kids are &#34;little building block&#34; enthusiasts.
They love them.
But they can get very pricey, very fast.
I was a little concerned that there Kre-Os wouldn't work with the million other little building blocks we have.
Well, imagine my surprise when they fit!
The people are made a little differently, so Kre-O legs have to go on Kre-O torsos.
This set also comes with a vibrating plate that makes noise.
The kids (7 years old, 6 years old, 4 years old, and 2 years old) thought that part was fantastic.
They love monsters and this had plenty to keep them happy.
Awesome set.
My 7 year old and 6 year old were able to  build the mansion in one afternoon following the direction booklet by themselves.
I have purchased many different Lego sets for my grandson, but this looked like something he would enjoy and I was able to get it free from Amazon Vine to review.
He loves this set.
He had no problem putting it together, and he loved the glow in the dark spiders that came with it.
These blocks can also be used with the Lego brand of building blocks, but they fit a little snug when used with the other brand.
These sets are much cheaper than the popular brand but are just as much fun to play with.
Apparently these new KRE-O sets are based on a Zynga city-building app (think online, social Sim City).
I'm not familiar with that, but I'm guessing the connection is minimal at best (a marketing ploy to get adult CityVille players to buy these sets for their 7-14 year-olds perhaps?).
At any rate, the CityVille marketing tie-in seems tacked-on at best.This set is pretty fun, not just to build, but to play with after the fact (that's kind of my litmus test when it comes to building kits aimed at kids, is it still fun to play with once it's assembled).
KRE-O's are basically Lego knock-off's, but unlike some of those other block building sets (some of which feature pieces that won't stay together while others basically have large, molded plastic pieces with a few Lego studs that effectively take most of the &#34;building&#34; out of the scenario), the KRE-O's happen to compare rather well to its inspiration.
Assembly was straight-forward (my 11 year-old nephew assembled this one with no assistance) and the pieces actually stayed together.
While this particular set isn't quite as well-designed as some of the (much more expensive) Lego sets (or some of the other CityVille KRE-O sets for that matter), for the asking price, it's pretty good.
It certainly doesn't deserve single-star reviews.What really made this a fun set (aside from the monster theme, Baron Batcakes and the Skeleton in particular) are the fact that the KRE-O sets actually make sound and the Kreons (minifigures) move with the 3 included motion bricks.
You'll need 3 AAA batteries (which are NOT included) to take advantage of these features (ahem...&#34;Sonic Motion Technology&#34;), but it really adds to the playability of the set.
The included minifigures (the Kreons) are TINY, with heads roughly the same size as their Lego counterparts, but with miniscule bodies (that only require one single brick/stud to stand on).
They're nice enough and you get more than a couple of them (5 in this &#34;budget&#34; set, one of which is a &#34;mystery&#34; Kreon), but I do wish they were a bit larger.Overall, the CityVille Invasion Skyscraper Mayhem Set is a great one for play and for building.
It's not too difficult to put together and it's probably more fun to play with once it is.
As a bonus, there's a CityVille invasion app for iOS and Android bundled with the set (looks like a combination tower defense, shooting game set in the CityVille Invasion KRE-O &#34;universe&#34;), but I couldn't try it out on account of my Android tablets being of the older, incompatible variety.
My 7 yr old son, who is an &#34;interlocking brick toy play set&#34; enthusiast, really enjoyed playing creating and playing with this set.
He typically will go for vehicle heavy sets and loves the challenge of putting them together.We found this one different than what we are used to.
The instructions are similar to other &#34;interlocking brick toy play sets&#34;, but not quite as well done.
The mini figures are much more mini than the 'other brand' but were sometimes more interesting.There is a battery operated component to this set, a large square brick that you put 3 AA batteries in to make it vibrate and make sounds.
In this case, spooky ghosts, doors creaking and the like, plus one annoyingly out of place man yelling &#34;KRE-O!&#34; at the end of each sound cycle.
The vibrations are a stroke of genius, as they cause the set itself to shake oh-so-slightly.
Because it comes with 2 stands on which to place the figurines that are covered with a soft, rubbery bristle, it makes the figures glide across the base seemingly moving on their own.The genius comes with the 2 rubbery feet that you attach to the bottom of the base plate.
This helps it not slide around while you are building it but also stops the vibrations from driving you mad when the box is turned on.All in all, my 7 year old son digs the set, found it fairly easy to put together and is enjoying the accompanying App on his iPod.
As an adult, I have allegiance to my old &#34;interlocking plastic brick sets&#34;, but I'll put that aside for my son to enjoy his new toy.
My family and I took time together to build several Kre-o CityVille sets.
In the meantime, I took notes from both the adult and child building the set.
My adult nephew is an avid building blocks fan.
He thoroughly enjoys building Lego and Megablock sets according to the plans.
My 10 YO son is enjoys playing with building blocks, creating his own designs, and adores playing the the minifigs.Between the three of us, this is what I compiled regarding this set, and pretty much all the other Kre-o sets out there.In comparison to Lego and MegaBlocks, Kre-o blocks feel like you're working with crayons.
The blocks don't fit well.
When several blocks are connected, you can see uneven gaps showing the blocks are not sealing well against each other.
My adult nephew found the blocks more difficult to work with compared to the other brands.My son enjoyed playing with the finished product, but it didn't take long before the pieces started falling off.
However, he loved the little action figures.
They were the most popular part of the whole set.The sound block is annoying.
It just keeps going and going with all kinds of creepy sounds.
My son didn't like it and keeps it off.Kre-o has great ideas for fun building block sets, but they need to up the quality of the building blocks.
They look and feel cheap quality.
The interlocking fit is not great either.
A little more attention to the quality of the build, and Kre-o can have something really good going here.
The best thing is that YES, KRE-O is compatible with the other &#34;famous building block maker!&#34; The pieces fit snug with both brands.KRE-o goes one step further, providing cool features we probably wouldn't be able to afford (because the name has gotten so expensive to have.)
The pieces are good quality plastic.
I have no experience with previous building sets from this company.It came with a &#34;mystery&#34; figure.
My 11-year-old considered it to be a REALLY cool (glow-in -the-dark) bonus.Other cool stuff featured : vibrating square that gives the illusion of movement, especially when the &#34;special&#34; rubberized items are on it.
Glow in the dark pieces (like the spiders) make it even more cool, according to my 11-year-old.
Haven't tried the spooky sounds.There is a piece that kids can pretend to &#34;launch&#34; like a missile, but it doesn't &#34;shoot out&#34;- there is no spring mechanism or anything like that.
It just gets released and falls out of its holder.
Another part let's you make a character look like it's &#34;popping up&#34; out of a grave.Small parts make this unsuitable for kids aged 3 or less, but makes it a lot of fun for older kids!
My 5.5 year old son and I enjoy building Legos and he was very excited when he saw this set coming.
It was our first experience with a KRE-O set and I was expecting a lot bigger set when looking at the photos.
The blocks are smaller than the comparable Lego bricks.
This makes them very hard to handle.
Even my 5 year old with his small fingers had problems.So after we put the set all together, the whole mansion was only about the size of a can of soup.
A little disappointing.The sound and motion is a nice touch, and I like that the volume can be controlled.The verdict is a mixed bag, sort of like this review.
Sorry for the humble of thoughts.
At first, I didn't think the sound box was working - it was noisy!
Then I read that it makes the characters move around the board when they are on the little spikey holders.
VERY neat!!
The boys love both the noise and the vibration movement!
Plus, the haunted house theme is pretty neat too.Technical details are pretty standard, dump out the pieces, sort them a little, follow the instructions and let the kids play.This is a new favorite.
