Reviews:
So I'm sure if you're a man or have boys, you are familiar with Hot Wheels cars.
In my childhood, the Hot Wheels tracks were all designed to be played with on the floor.
Now, we have technology that allows the tracks to be built into your wall.UNBOXING:The box is rather large, considering what is inside it.
All the parts are not wrapped inside, except for the instructions and sticker sheet.
When you get it, you will hear a lot of rattling if you shake the box, but don't worry, the pieces are pretty sturdy and the set is more than likely not broken.REVIEW:The Hot Wheels Roto-Arm Revolution is a closed-loop set.
There are several track and motorized pieces to put together, but the instructions are very good at sectioning all the smaller pieces into the larger set.
It requires empty wall-space (about 2' x 4'), 2 D batteries (not included), and scotch tape (not included).
Make sure your wall is clean, and that you have time to spare to set this up.
The instructions say it takes about 20 minutes to put up, but I got it done in about 15.
The set provides 6 Command wall-tape strips--5 are needed for assembly and there's one extra in case you make a mistake.
Additionally, the instructions recommend 1 hour curing time for the Command strips before you hang the set on the wall, but I only waited about 5 minutes, and there were no problems.My boys were too young to help with the set up (&lt;5 yrs), but the pictures made it simple work to set the anchors on the wall (template instructions are REALLY important to use).The track makes for good fun.
My boys have played with it non-stop since setting it up (about an hour).
But I think novelty eventually will wear off.
The track has the ability to expand with other Wall Tracks sets on either the high right or low left sides.
I imagine that this would make it more fun.
Ultimately, once you put a few cars on the tracks, the motorized roto-arm makes all the cars move in the system.
Hot Wheels tracks are cool because you can control the cars, use existing cars, and customize the way pieces go together to make your own race tracks.
This one has none of those characteristics.
Here's why:1.
The track only works put together in one way.
And I don't see a way to add existing (ground) tracks to it to customize.2.
Other cars we already own don't always work.
There are a lot of shapes of Hot Wheels and only certain shapes will be picked up.3.
If you batteries die - and they will pretty quickly - then the set is useless.
You can't use it without batteries, even if it were on the ground.4.
The stickies that hold it on the walls don't stay stuck.Me and my kids love Hot Wheels and we love the tracks as well.
This set just seems too convoluted to work.
I don't recommend it.
Sorry Hot Wheel fans!
For the money there are many other better sets.
My kids found it kind of boring.
They thought it would be a track where you have to time the jumps to avoid the claw, as that is what is advertised on the box.
Yet 99% of the time, it makes it through and just goes on a continuous boring loop that makes too much noise.
The unit must attach to a wall to and that is kind of a bummer.
My kids did not have a wall available and needed a spot where they could attach it.
I have no idea what it's gonna do to the wall when we take it down eventually.
"I love the concept of hot wheels and when they're working correctly my kids love playing with them, but I'm continually frustrated by how difficult the assembly is, how frequently they break, and how much work they are as an adult.
My almost 5 year old can usually put things together when they fall apart, but not always with this, which means he's not entertained which is the entire purpose of toys.I know the description says ""wall tracks"" but I didn't realize it needed to be mounted to a wall and it really is quite large.
You would definitely need a play room that your kids actually use in order to put this there.
It's not something you can hang up and take down (THAT would be brilliant), but rather it needs to live there and it's not exactly art work.
In fact, you're supposed to wait an hour to use it after mounting it.
You definitely don't want excited kids around while you take 20 minutes to put it together and then wait another hour for the command strips to do their thing.I will say the entertainment value was high.
When it's assembled and working correctly my kids love it.
But right now it's in pieces in a spare room and has been there for a few weeks.
Our train tracks get quite a bit more use.
I wish someone would combine the classic, kid friendly train track system with the fast paced action of hot wheels.
We'd be all over that."
The hot wheels wall tracks have a lot going for them.
They are durable, don't take up floor space (so they don't leave the classic my kids were playing here mess).
If you have 3+ sets they can create large tracks with lots of variability, and space for multiple kids to play at once.
At that point they also seem to hold kids interest for much larger periods of time.However, as an individual set this one didn't keep my kids attention for long enough, additionally because of the claw there are a limited number of cars that work with it.One aside, I found that using velcro tape is a better way to attach them to the wall because it means it's easier to stick them back on the wall when they get knocked off.
I love this concept and my seven year old was thrilled to have this toy.
However the experience has been somewhat disappointing.Fun:The mechanism which lifts the cars is very cool.
One rotating arm picks up the car and rotates 180 degrees with it at which point the other arm picks it up and transfers it to the top level from where it can go down one of two ramps.
You choose if it will go on the high ramp and do a jump or go to a lower ramp where it gets picked up by some track on the side of one arm and is transferred to the other side.
In theory this can go on indefinitely.However- It is quite loud.
The rotation of the motor/gears is loud and there are levers that are struck every rotation.- About one of every five times the car fails to go around the circuit, either landing wrong or not getting picked up correctly.- It should work with other cars but only the one that came with the set appears to have the right weight and dimensions- after about five days, the ramp that receive the car from the upper arm has moved slightly, causing the arm to bang against it and get stuck.
My son told me it was broken, but I realized I needed to use some tape to prop up that one piece slightly.- There is a knob you turn to make it go on the upper or lower route.
It would have been nice if somehow this could automatically alternate or change randomly.Assembly:Assembly was not very easy.
Some of the parts were different colors than shown on the instructions and it is a somewhat complex constructions.
That said, it didn't take us much longer than 20 minutes it claims.
We did take our time with the adhesive on the wall.
We cleaned the wall (eggshell latex paint) and the parts with alcohol and waited an hour after attaching the plates.
The template is critical to getting the spacing correct.
It is firmly attached.It requires 2' x 4' of wall space to work.
This happens to fit on the wall next to the lower bunk of a bunk bed, which he likes.
He played a bit with it the first few days, but now it is much less.
The roto-arm is a hit with my 6 year old son, BUT the assembly/application to wall leaves room for improvement.
We are going to put it on an old board rather than directly adhering to wall after reading the other reviews of failure to stick or possibility of peeling plaster.
Will add to review after we do that.
Without adding to the wall tracks with the other sets, though, I think this will not be a toy that ultimately holds my son's interest after the initial playing, and buying multiple sets is a pricey option that would require a very large board.....
I spent time painstakingly following the directions for this set and wasn't disappointed.
Assembly is pretty straight forward with all the pieces labeled and nothing is really that hard.
Mine is well mounted and has been on the wall for a bit over two weeks now with zero mounting failures.
The set is designed to pop off of the mounts if it gets hit and my two boys have done that a few times and it pops back on easilyFor robust play I have to give this set high marks.
The parts snapped together and have stayed that way unless hit.
The geared claw can get stuck a few different ways and once you free the jam it recovers quickly and syncs up with the other claw for handing off the car.So it's tough and doesn't fall off the wall...  but otherwise it's a simple track.
You basically get two different routes a car can take and if you can get three cars that fit the track you've reached capacity.
Some cars are too wide, narrow, tall, short, long, heavy... any of those can cause a car to not work in some important way.
Of our collection we had three cars that work consistently.
It was good for a few hours on a weekend (about 1 set of batteries) and then my boys were down with it.
There is no way (without buying a complimentary set)to do anything cool with the tracks and this won't do anything on the ground at all.While impressed with the durability of this set and it's initial cool factor it fades fast with few options, no race features, and no way to reuse the parts in other ways...
My 7yr old was able to put this together, with included instructions, entirely on her own.
That was probably the most fun part for her of this whole thing.My kids played with it first without batteries while my husband ran to the store to buy the right sized ones.
They were enjoying it and found most of the hot wheels they owned worked okay on the track alongside the one that is included.The fun ended almost instantly after the batteries were inserted.
That took all of the 'kid power' out of the toy as the children had no way to participate but to sit back and watch this track do it's thing.
It literally lifts the car back to the top to go down again only to be lifted back up for the whole thing to repeat.
Also, many of their hot wheels cars no longer worked as the arm couldn't quite pick them up right.They tried this out once or twice more (with the batteries turned off)).
The next morning the thing had already fallen off the wall, all but one of the stuck brackets.
We followed the instructions to a t and it just didn't stay put.
I don't see us running off to buy more sticky tabs to stick this thing back up....ever.
I have four boys, and unless they want something from matchbox or hot wheels really, really bad, I usually avoid due to poor quality in relation to the price.
I remember these products as kids being sturdy and fun.
This product, like the other new products, worked great for a small period of time.
My kids did really enjoy it, and if it would stay in just the right place it would be fun, but they don't, so the cars don't move down the tracks as you would expect.
We finally ended up hooking magnets to them and putting them on my boys magnetic walls, and that worked better.
It still seems that some cars, mostly the really small ones, work better than others.
This is not the first Hot Wheels wall track that we have.
They're great rainy day fun, and the expansion tracks are what make them the most fun.
These allow the kids to add jumps, etc.
using their imagination once the cars finish the predetermined paths.The biggest complaint/issue are the 3M mounting strips.
It doesn't take long before they lose their adhesive qualities as the Hot Wheels tracks are a bit heavier than what you'd normally use those strips for.
I'd recommend that you purchase some of the 3M Command mounting strips to have on hand (not sure off the top of my head which size is required).This is not a toy that's going to played with repeatedly.
Thankfully it's pretty easy to remove, leaving only the wall mounting plates behind.This does require D batteries, so if you're buying as a gift, don't overlook that requirement.
"The 8 year old boy just loves this.Yes, if you are not comfortable putting things together, you might find it challenging, but overall not too bad.Like the colors, the durability, the added feature of the ""tower"" (not really a tower, don't know what else to call it.
)Rated it high overall because it is a lot of fun, especially for those indoor days.All of the hot wheel cars/ motorbikes, etc work well on this track.Can be combined with other track to extend it.Think a good toy has educational value-in putting it together, getting it to work well, and watching the cars go around the track really is an exercise in applied physics.
Acceleration & centripetal force anyone?"
My boys are huge hotwheels fans, so this was a huge hit when it arrived.
However, past the first days the play interest waned.
It also didn't stay on the wall the way it was supposed to.
So I don't recommend it; there are nicer sets out there.
Once I opened the box and dumped all the parts out onto my son's bed I was a little bit put back by all the parts but after reviewing the instructions it didn't look that bad.
I found that you are required to tape the template on the wall at designated spots on the template in order to place the parts.
You need some painters tape to do this and it isn't included.
I don't know why they didn't give you a few strips on a sheet or a sample type roll to do it since it is needed.
I didn't have any tape and I didn't want to mess the paint up on the wall so we had to postpone the build to the next day.After a trip to Home Depot to pick up a roll of painters tape (way more than we needed) we got the template placed and began the assembly.
The instructions are pictures with arrows and letters, the parts are marked with the letters, if you can follow picture instructions you should be able to put it all together without a problem.
I noticed the dreaded sticker sheet when I was going through stuff but it wasn't too bad when it came time to place them.
Take your time on the claws and you should be OK.
Overall assembly wasn't too bad and took about 20 minutes.After we got it all together and running we found that you need to be selective of what cars you run on it.
The best spot in the room to place the track for us happens to be above the baseboard heater.
When a vehicle didn't work well it would fall off the track and bang off the heater.
I wasn't too happy about that so we cut some of that cabinet liner rubber to protect the heater.
We found that lower profile car type vehicles seemed to work the best.Overall a pretty cool track but you need to choose cars for it carefully.
Also as cool as it is by itself it does get old after a while and you will want to expand the track with another set.
We haven't done that yet but there appear to be a few entry and exit points built in to connect other sets.After building and seeing my son play with it at this point I think I would recommend the track if you have the desire, space, and money to expand the track by adding track sets.
The track has been up for over a week now and the 3M strips have held well.
My guys like hot wheels, and race tracks are very heavily abused in my home.
I rated this three stars for durability not because it has fallen apart, but just because (like all race tracks) you have to stabalize it pretty well for the track pieces to stay together.
The plastic itself is durable, and the individual pieces don't tend to break.
Education?
Well, I suppose it helps them learn to build things, but I wouldn't call this an educational product per se.
But fun?
Oh yea.
The kids are having a ball.
It has fit in with the other hot wheels tracks as well, and the roto arm adds a new aspect to their track building.
A lot of fun for them (ages 6, 8, and 9), and I think it is a good bet for most boys of this age.
Oh, my!
The squeals of delight when this came out of the box were phenomenal.
They had cooled a bit by the time this was all assembled, but got started right back up again when it was all in place.
If it was more easily assembled and was more sturdy it would be a solid hit.
As it was, it was hard to put up and keep up.
Very cool concept.
Lots of fun.
The kids still like it, but it's a bit of a pain to get it to work as designed.
"The ""cool"" factor definitely results in a 4.5 rating; but the price versus quality does not seem to be quite right.
The setup definitely requires ADULT involvement.
The wall track is mounted with 3M strips [included], but it is important to allow the strips time to cure so they will continue to hold.
This is difficult when you have an excited child who is eager to play with his or her new toy.
Initially, the overall setup appears to be complicated; but it turns out to be relatively straightforward.
The Roto-Arm is mechanized and requires 2 D-Cell Batteries which are NOT INCLUDED.
It is important to note that NOT ALL Hot Wheels cars seem to be compatible with this set.
We found this to be a bit disappointing.
For the Roto-Arm to function properly, your child needs to use the same approximate size and weight of Hot Wheels car that is included with the set.
The set definitely provides instant excitement, but it also tends to lead to frustration.
When dealing with ""The Claw,"" if you time it right, you'll make the jump, avoid the claw, and ride the auto-lift back up.
But if you're too fast or slow, you'll hit the claw and fly off the set and crash!
At first, the kids thought something was wrong.
We had to explain that is is like a game in which you need to work on your timing.
They still tend to get frustrated when they get ""knocked off.""
I do believe after many years, Hot Wheels has come up with a unique design.
