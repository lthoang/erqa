Reviews:
I was pleased with this product overall.
I did store a puzzle for a month and the blow-up bladder did seem to lose some air.
Just be sure to re-inflate before you unroll your puzzle in that case.The felt was very large and can easily accommodate a humongous puzzle.
No issues with pieces sliding around.
It came with elastic rings that fit over both ends --- very nice so none have the chance to escape out if you happen to carry it vertically.I recommend this for families who like to work large puzzles, but may not have a free table to leave the puzzle pieces out at for a long period of time.
Roll it up and you know your puzzle is secure.
This is a pretty basic product but is a great item to have in our house since we love to put puzzles together and don't always have the ability to keep them out to be worked on.
It comes with a really large piece of blue felt, an inflatable tube, and three elastic bands.
I really like this puzzle storage mat.
I do hope the inflatable tube doesn't pop though, because then I will have a problem rolling the puzzle up.
So far it has worked well.
I rolled up an already completed puzzle by carefully sliding the blue mat under the puzzle and then rolling it.
I had a few problems getting the pieces to stay in tact, but since I didn't start the puzzle with it already underneath, I count that as user error.
I then put the three bands around each end and middle of the mat.
I would say that the bands could be a adjustable or a little smaller so that it had a tighter fit and that would make me happier with the product.
I also would like a sleeve of some sort to put the whole puzzle in after it's rolled closed to keep any loose pieces together.
Overall I am pleased with the Giant Stow And Go.
I normally adore Ravensburger products.
Their puzzles are some of the finest around, with high quality, durable construction and great imagery.
This product is also high quality, but I simply find it an unnecessary deviation from the usual approach.
Puzzle stow-ers typically include a felt sheet with a rigid cardboard tube.
And they usually work just fine; yes, there's a little puzzle piece alignment loss with rolling, but its as good as you can get.
This product replaces the rigid tube with an inflatable one.
I frankly don't see the benefit in any way that would make me want to buy the product (this is a Vine review mind you).
There's a few problems.
First, yes this is whiney, but its annoying to have to blow up the tube to use it.
Second, the tube, while generally high quality (this isn't your standard chinese low grade plastic), isn't 100% flat; as a result, when you roll, more misalignment occurs than you'd get with a rigid tube.
Is it enough to really be a problem?
Probably depends on the size of puzzle/pieces you're working.
If big enough, yes, you'll see a significant impact.
Third, the felt sheet arrives folded in the package.
This is a high quality felt that's thick for repeated use.
Good, but the fact that it comes folded means those creases will remain for a long time (unless you iron, and the heat might destroy the felt - unknown).
I didn't realize how LARGE this puzzle Stow And Go would be.
I got it for my 13 year old daughter who would love to do more puzzles, but doesn't have a safe place to leave them out because of her younger siblings.She opened it for Christmas and was eager to try it out.
It is really too large to use on a card table (which is her usual puzzle space, in her bedroom), but she left the edges hanging down and gave it a try anyway.
When she was ready to stop, she rolled the puzzle up, and moved it to a safe place.
Later that day, she got it out and continued working on it.
It worked great!
One edge of the puzzle came loose, but she was able to easily put it back together.Because this is the giant stow and go, it would probably work better for her on the floor, or on the dining room table.At first I was disappointed that the tube on the end is an inflatable tube.
It seemed less durable to me.
But it actually means that when we aren't working on a puzzle, we can deflate the tube and put it away, using less space.
Since we don't plan to give this to the younger children, and my 13 year old is responsible enough to not use it as a bat or sword, I expect it will last a long time, even if it is an inflatable tube.Ravensburger is one of our favorite puzzle companies, and their products are all high quality.
We trust them, and we're looking forward to years of use from their Stow and Go.
This puzzle mat is big enough for almost any puzzle and works great.
The storage box for the puzzle mat is great as well, it goes right back into it with no problem when it isn't in use.
The ones I've had before were hard to store.
This is a very large mat to stow a puzzle on and then move around.
Makes it really nice if you do your puzzling on the dinning room table (like I do).
A couple of comments.
When you roll and unroll a few pieces flip over (not a big deal though).
The general puzzle stays in position.
One thing I would like to see is a skid proof backing on this.
Your mat will sit on a table and when you go to stand up or push on the mat a little it will fly across the table.
This is sort of a pain in the butt.
But, of course you can just not push on it and solve that problem.
I had been working on my puzzles either on the dining room table or on a cheap old painting that we don't plan on hanging.
Needless to say, this mat is exactly what I needed!
No more accidentally knocking part of the puzzle or sorted puzzles pieces onto the floor, or having my baby try to eat the pieces on the painting.
I love that I can just fold a puzzle up and put it out of the way before it can be ruined by drool or build up dust.
Also, I can take it into any room and have privacy while I work on the puzzle.
This mat is durable and very easy to use and transport.
If you love puzzles, then this mat is a must, period!
Ravensburger Giant Stow And Go(Ravensburger toys)------------------------------------------------------Not being a super-genius, I am not able to finish 1000 and 1500-plus piece jigsaw puzzles instantaneously, although I do like working on them.
But the clutter drives my wife nuts, so I've been looking into getting a stow-and-go for a while, and finally tried this model out.
Basically, this is a huge piece of moderately thick, firm felt, which you place under the puzzle, then roll up around a long tube (which you have to inflate) wrapping the puzzle up along with the felt when it's time to store your work.It works okay, though there are some difficulties.
The mat comes in a cardboard box roughly the same size and shape of a typical Ravensburger box, which would make it convenient to store with your puzzles, except that the mat is folded up into squares inside the box, and comes out creased and a bit stiff: in order to smooth the creases, you have to iron it flat, and once you've done that, you might not want to fold it up again to get it in the box.
So then you have an extra object - the box - to store, along with the puzzle-in-progress.
There can be some falling-apart  when the puzzle is rolled away, but overall your work will be preserved.
I've also seen flat puzzle savers, basically designed like artist portfolios, and I might try one of those next.
But this was okay... better than having to tear the whole thing apart when the living room is needed again.
Hmmm.
Maybe I just need a bigger house.
Really glad that I read one other reviewers suggestion to iron the felt before use, because after ironing the Stow and Go was able to be used as designed.
The Stow and Go is a very large section of felt with a blow up tube that works as described once the creases are removed from the felt.
I am now able to commit to a large puzzle knowing that I can put it away safely before inquiring minds and little hands are awake.
Is this the best method of saving a puzzle in progress or after completion?
I'm not sure, but it works great for what it is.
We rolled up a completed 1000 piece puzzle and a 1000 piece puzzle in progress.
The puzzle remained completely intact after unrolling.
The only thing I am skeptical about is the blow-up roller.
It worked fine, but may not stay blown up for long term storage.
Bottom line is that it works great and is a practical and workable solution to saving your puzzle, at least in the short term.
If you always like to keep a puzzle going, this product is a must have!
It makes your puzzle portable-you can move it off the dining room table so you can eat there.
It is a very excellent product form the most amazing puzzle company in the world.
Ravensburger definitely knows puzzles and also how to move them around.
;)
"Having an easy way to store puzzles-in-progress is a great idea.
I was hopeful that this would be a wonderful product for that.
I was disappointed that it wasn't.
First, because the felt was folded in the box, it left ""hills and valleys"" on the puzzle-working surface.
Ironing may take care of that, but if we store the puzzle mat back in the original box between puzzles, it would be the same problem each time.
The inflatable tube that you roll the felt, and the puzzle, around is somewhat slippery.
And then it comes with three heavy-duty rubber bands to put around the whole thing.
It does work, after a fashion, but just not as well as I had hoped.
I would probably try something different before I would recommend this product."
I love this blue mat.
It saves the puzzle and it's pieces for storage and lets you continue later on.
It's self explanatory and my 8 year old cleans up well now.
No more puzzles left around!
He works on it, and when he's finished rolls it up carefully but securely so he can out away for the day!
In our family we like to have a puzzle to work on together especially over long weekends and vacations.
It can take days or weeks but it brings out a team effort and cooperation in us all.
It's a way to spend time together, unwind, and bond.
That said, what are you supposed to do with it when you are done?
I just can't bring myself to just tear it down.
All those moments building the puzzle make it have meaning!
So I ordered this Puzzle Stow and Go.
I had another puzzle storage device but it was more to put it away and finish it later because it was large and flat.
It took up a lot of space.
This one comes with an inflatable tube, then you roll it up into a quite compact rolled up poster size for easy storage.
It holds puzzles from 1000 to 3000 pieces.
The surface is rubberized so the loose pieces of unfinished puzzles do not slide out.
If you or someone you know enjoys doing puzzles then this makes a perfect gift.
We just really started getting into puzzles now that the kids are old enough to do the harder ones.
With the larger amounts means it takes more than an hour to put one together so finding something we can use to put our puzzle away until we can work on it again was a necessity.
So I ordered this hoping it would help and it does.
We are even going to see how well it holds up to a move we have scheduled in the not too distant future.
The areas where I see that may be problems are in the felt is folded, and is creased and the bands used to hold the puzzle in place do not seem to be tight enough for me, and the tube is inflatable which means it could leak out air or burst.
But so far two weeks later it is working well.
We are definitely happy with our purchase.
The grandkids love puzzles--and so do I.
There was just one problem.
We have a place at the shore and sometimes we'd start a puzzle there and want to take it home to finish.
The Stow and Go takes care of that nicely.
You just gotta remember to put it on the table before you start the puzzle.
In a nutshell, this is a large (as in, HUGE) piece of stiff blue flannel material that you are supposed to build your puzzle on, and then when you need to move your puzzle or put it away for a while, you use the inflatable bolster to roll the fabric up, puzzle and all.It's a good idea, but did not work as well as I hoped.
After struggling to roll it up, I was planning to give this product two stars, but when we unrolled the puzzle I was surprised that it was still together at all, so I upped it to three stars.Flaws:1.
Fabric is ridiculously big.
Who builds 3000 piece puzzles anyways, let alone expects to move them?
Our puzzle is only 500 pieces and was dwarfed by the fabric, not to mention the material was bigger than my table and hung over the sides awkwardly.
It's impossible to move your puzzle onto the fabric after you've started building, you have to put the fabric on your table and build on top of it, which is unrealistic because it's so big.2.
Rolling up the puzzle without breaking it to pieces was really hard.
The bolster doesn't help all that much and I had to repair our puzzle several times before I got it rolled up.3.
On unrolling, the puzzle WAS mostly in tact, but our high-quality Ravensburger puzzle pieces were bent and warped.Conclusion: This is a cool idea, and I was drawn to it because we are trying to sell our house and thought it would be helpful to put away the puzzle when we have house showings, but it really was more hassle than its worth.
While it would be cool to just roll up a puzzle and stow it away, that's a pretty tall order and I don't believe any product would do a really stellar job of it.
Puzzles just aren't meant for rolling.
Bottom line: I took a 100 piece Ravensburger puzzle and worked on it with this mat and it worked for me.
I would recommend.
There are a couple secrets to its success, and one limiting factor.This is really a simple product - almost too simple.
It consists of a HUGE blue felt mat, an inflatable center piece, and three elastic straps.
All you do is lay out the blue felt and keep the puzzle pieces 7 inches away from the edge.
(To give a sense of scale, I was able to barely place every one of the 1000 Ravensburger puzzle pieces on the blue mat, but couldn't adhere to the 7 inch rule.)
When you're ready to put the puzzle away, you place the inflatable center along the inside edge, and roll tightly and slowly.
Because of the length of the mat, watch out for slack developing on either end.
Once rolled up, secure with the three elastic bands.
This is best done by two people in order to maintain tension on the rolled puzzle.
I don't think a lot of pressure is needed, and compressing things could damage your pieces.
I just removed slack and kept things finger tight.In my test, I had mostly un-assembled pieces rolled up (figuring assembled will not be enough challenge in my test).
Once rolled up, I tried to get puzzle pieces to fall out.
I did get one to slip out, but this is after tossing it in the air, rotating the roll, and shaking it, far beyond the due care you should use when you have hundreds of puzzle pieces rolled in a thin mat!
Upon unrolling, my small built pieces were fine - just curved a bit, but no apparent damage.
The diameter of the inflatable piece seems to work with the puzzle pieces to minimize impact.
