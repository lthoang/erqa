Reviews:
I am always on the lookout for toys that I can keep at my house for when my granddaughter comes over.
I have always had a soft spot in my heart for little people toys and this house is a double home run as it plays music which my granddaughter loves.
This house is very durable as my granddaughter is quite rough on it.
She loves to put the people in the car although there is only enough room for two of the characters.
The characters that come with the house are a mommy, daddy and baby.
The Baby's high chair looks a bit like a cup so my granddaughter quite often will pretend like it is one.
One of her favorite toys as she plays with it everytime she comes over.
"Our two-year-old daughter loves this doll house.
It is very similar to the other Fisher-Price Little People sets - strong, durable, colorful, and full of little details, buttons, and noises.
If you're looking for a solid little doll house, you can't go wrong with this one.The reason I didn't give it five stars is because the ""little people"" from the set don't look like the ""little people"" we have in similar sets a few years back.
Apparently they are ""little people 2.0"" or something.
They fit in the other doll houses, but not exactly.
However, this isn't a big negative - we still give two thumbs up to this doll house.
I'm almost sure it'll last quite a while!"
This toy is for ages 1-4 according to the box, and my little girl is on the younger end of that age range.
I wasn't sure if it would hold her attention yet but she just LOVES it!
She couldn't even keep her hands off it while I was putting it together!I really like Little People toys and I've been trying to collect a lot of them so she can play with them as she grows.
I like that all the people and animals are interchangeable and will work with different toys and buildings.
It makes for a greater variety of play.This set is really cute and comes with a mommy, daddy, and baby.
The house also comes with a car and a table.
The house has a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living room, and baby room.
There is a set of steps, and a porch with a door.
There are 12 songs that play - on the porch, the baby room, the toilet, the telephone, etc.
This is so cute!The only thing I didn't like was that it took 4 screws to put this together and it took a lot of elbow grease to turn the screws.
It wasn't as easy as I expected it to be.
But it does seem durable enough, we will see after my little girl plays with it for a while.I would definitely recommend this toy and any of the Little People products.
"I was looking for a doll house as I work with children.
(One of my kids already made the mom and dad kiss on the bed by crossing them sideways like a letter ""T"".)
It has sounds and is very cute.
I wish it would have brought a dog or cat or any kind of pet to demonstrate that a family includes furry friends as well.
Overall, a great investment for parents, educators and those who work with children."
"As I have come to expect this toy is just as sturdy and well put together as other Fisher Price toys.
Everything looks great with no sharp edges or other imperfections I see from cheaper company's kids toys.
It comes with batteries installed and our kids love all the various sounds from the ""house"".
The car and two little people are great and just the right size for our kids who are two.
They have so much fun ""pretending"" with mommy, daddy and baby and can't get enough of this house.
Overall I would highly recommend this great toy!"
"I bought a used version of this toy that was missing some pieces, but that didn't lessen the many hours of fun my niece and I had playing with it.
In the old version that I had it had a computer that made typing noises, a washer and dryer that made washing noises.
a living room they could sit in and a baby bed that when pressed made lullaby sounds.
This new version has sounds that the other one didn't, but I am a little disappointed that some of these things were replaced.This new version is taller than the older one that I had, which is nice, but I am not a big fan of the gates and swing out door.
They pop on and off and I'm not a fan of that.
One good thing is that it does come with a car.
One last thing, is that the older version of the house seemed to be more gender neutral, whereas this new version is decidedly pink and purple and seems geared more towards girls.Overall I don't think you can ever go wrong with Fisher Price's Little People, though I do think that these ""improvements"" are just so-so compared to the older versions.
I wish they would offer a ""classic"" version, and a new version.
Who knows maybe they will someday just like they have other classic Fisher Price toys that I played with growing upBasic Fun Two Tune TelevisionBasic Fun Fisher Price Record Player"
I got this toy for my two year old daughter.
I can give it a mostly positive review, based on her reaction to it.
She plays with it a lot, gets totally consumed by it at times.
She likes to move the three figures - the mom, dad, and baby - to different parts of the little house.
She likes to press the buttons that make all the different songs play.
She always gets excited when the faux phone rings.
So she likes it, and I'm happy.
My only gripe is that there could be more figures and accessories.
Just the three people, and the one little car that two of them can fit in, isn't a lot to go on, besides the structure itself.
As much as my daughter enjoys the toy, as long as it can keep her entertained, I think all of this would go all that much farther if there were more figures to play with, and more things to do with them.
But overall I think it's a good toy and I recommend it to other parents.
I'm fairly certain my daughter would concur.
I have a 7,5,3, and 1 year old and all of them were amazed at all the little details and sounds.
All wanted to play with it!
Mine didn't seem to have directions in it, but I still managed to find where the 4 little screws went, but it did include batteries and makes all sorts of adorable noises when you flush the potty or even answer the phone!
It has lots for your child to do, and I think it's very safe and durable.
A perfect first house for her to play with and it folds up easily for storing.
Love it!
"I ordered this toy for my 3-year-old grandson because he loved playing with my daughter's Fisher-Price Loving FamilyTM Grand Dollhouse.
Because of that model's  size and many pieces, however, this smaller starter house seemed to be more suitable for his developmental age.This toy comes in one box and requires minimal assembly.
The set contains a couple of parts that snap into place to build the rest of the home, 3 people: a mom, dad, and baby, a little car (that holds only two of the people), and a couple of little extra pieces for the house.
It is a perfect set for a first ""dollhouse"" that any boy or girl can enjoy.The house: has three floors and all the rooms you would expect in a house.
There are some moving parts, but nothing that would require too much fine motor skill for a young child.
There are various objects that, when pushed, will make a sound: a toilet flushing, a phone ringing, songs about good morning and good night from the clock, the stairs, etc.
I think it is interesting, however, that the bed wasn't actually made long enough to fit the dolls in to have them lie down.The people: there are no movable parts on the dolls.
They are just one solid piece -- you can't move arms or legs, they can't sit down or hold anything.
As I said, probably fine for a first dollhouse set.The car: not sure why they made a vehicle labeled as ""SUV"" when it really only holds two of the three dolls.
I would have preferred one that held all the dolls!The sounds are cute and thankfully there is not a constant noise coming from the house.
You can turn off the sounds or choose not to push the buttons to activate the songs.
My grandson might be on the older side for the product, but it is perfect for him right now.
He loves playing with the house and the people and all the songs and noises.
I give it 4 stars only because I think it would be more fun for him if the dolls could be bent to sit or had moving parts, and if the car actually held all the dolls at one time.One of the best things about this set is that it requires minimal effort to pick it up and put it away as there aren't a lot of pieces to keep track of.
I think he'll enjoy playing with this for a long time!"
My soon to be 2 year old spent more than 2 hours straight playing with this, so there's no better endorsement.The plastic is soft but sturdy and high quality as to be expected from Fisher Price.
The sound effects are lots of fun and can be activated by banging the soft rubber dolls against them.The older model did have more detailed molded furniture; the telephone, potty, stove and crib are all plain red plastic and don't much look like what they're supposed to!
The porch screws were also a little puzzling; snap pieces would be better.But all in all, lots of fun, and a real classic!
My daughter loves the Little People.
We have the older Little People house, and then got this newer one.
She adores this new house!It opens up easily and has push button areas that make noise.
There's a toilet, baby crib, stairway, stove, etc.
For some reason she goes straight for the crib and pushed the button (she's 10 months old).It comes with a baby, two parents and a car.
There are attachments (fences) that we leave off because they just get in the way.It's not the world's most durable plastic - it's kind of flimsy, but it suffices.
I think as long as kids don't sit on the house, it should hold up.This is one of my daughter's favorite toys.
Definitely recommended!
My daughter has just turned one and so is right at the bottom of the recommended age.
The house has the three levels and has a large selection of noises associated with objects like ringing for the phone and flushing for the toilet.
There is an off switch if it drives you mad.
I loved that this came with batteries so it works right out the box.
You do need to attach the front cover and a couple of base attachments.
I found the screws needed a little bit of hand strength to get them in but overall it was quick and easy to put together.
The new little people seem to have had a make over.
They are now thinner and taller.
However they are able to still mix and match without any problems with the older people.
This house is very girly with it being pink and it would be nice to be a little more gender neutral.
It come with a white family so if you want something different this is going to cost you extra.
I gave it four stars for educational as it is doll house and my children will learn about a house and the noises it makes as they play.
The older that child probably the less educational value as a lot of the information will already be known.
I loved this toy as it is something my one year old can have fun with just banging the people and pressing buttons but it can also grow with her as she learns how to play house.
This is a keeper with all our other little people and even though it is pink I am sure that my son can play with it too.
I am a preschool teacher and I have never met a child who doesn't love Little People!
Fisher-Prices' s Little People collection is timeless and a classic!
The new Happy Sounds Home is just as perfect as the older version.
As always, the house is simple to set up.
All you need is a small screwdriver.
Total setup is no more than ten minutes.
Kids love the bright colors.
For some  reason, the toilet is always the main attraction.
This toy is durable and withstands years of play.
I cannot recommend this toy enough.
And don't let the pink roof fool you... boys love this toy!
"This new version of the Fisher-Price Happy Sounds Home is really adorable.
It is quite similar to the older version (Fisher-Price Little People Happy Sounds Home) but with some nice improvements and additions.
I will compare this newer version with the older purple one:This newer version of the Happy Sounds Home is taller - 3 levels instead of 2.
It's a nice height for a young toddler to play with, sitting or standing.The people it comes with (a mom, a dad and a baby) are a slightly different size than the old house's people - taller and skinnier, and more flexible.
It is important to note that they are still interchangeable with the old house's fixtures - the new house's people fit into the older house, and vice versa (so if you own both, you can easily play with them together and all of the people will fit fine, despite being slightly different).There are a lot more sounds in this new house than in the old one - multiple sounds on each button, and many songs as well.
The songs of course are longer than just a little sound effect, but I think they are cute and not too annoying.
They are cute songs about babies, life at home, etc.
Of course any toy sounds can get annoying after awhile, so it is nice that there is an on/off switch on the bottom of the toy.
Another cute sound feature is that you can switch it from daytime mode to nighttime mode, and there are different sounds for each.
Sounds also play when you open and close the ""porch"" (the front part of the house that swings open and shut and contains the front door).This new house has a garage and a cute car, which is a nice addition from the old house.
I do think it is a little weird that there are only two seats in the car, and three family members, but the car is cute.
(Of course, with the old classic Little People sets, the people were much smaller so they could fit more people in a vehicle!)
It also comes with a kitchen table and a high chair for baby - so not a ton of added furniture, but you have to remember that much of the furniture is already attached to the house.This house comes with a couple of little gates that attach onto the sides of the house, apparently to create a ""neighborhood"" with other sets you can purchase.
I think this is a cute feature, and just wish that the old house had the same attachments so you could hook both houses together.
However, the two houses (if you happen to own the old one as well, like I do) still look super cute together and make a fun little neighborhood to play with.
The pink color is nice and bright and compliments the purple house well.As someone who grew up playing with and collecting the old classic Fisher-Price Little People sets, I highly recommend this toy and think it really is worth the money.
I was excited to check out this new Little People House.
I have a toddler who loves her Little People and I figured she might like this little house.
Let me start off by saying that we have enough Little People toys to create a Little People village and most of our Little People sets are from 5-11 years ago.
All of these older sets were very sturdy and made to last, much like 40 year old Little People sets the kids play with at their grandparents house.
These newer sets just don't seem like they're made to last.
The plastic is flimsy and easily flexes when little ones put any kind of pressure on them.
I am continually amazed at how much the quality of the Little People toys has dropped over the past 5 years.The house requires a bit of assembly.
It will take under 10 minutes to put this together, but 10 minutes with a toddler who is eager to play could feel a lot longer than that.This Happy Sounds home is cute.
The colors are girly which can be a drawback if you have a little boy and wanted to get him a Little People house.
Years ago you could get a Little People house that was a bit more gender neutral looking.
Sure it may have had some pink furniture, but the over all color scheme was pretty neutral.
I doubt many little boys are going to be drawn to this cute little pink house.Most of the furniture in this little house is molded into the plastic so little ones won't have the ability to rearrange rooms like they could do with older models of the doll house.
The only furniture little ones can move around are the kitchen table and the baby's high chair.
I was a bit surprised that there aren't any chairs for the Little People parents.The house does come with a small little car that seats two.
They call it an SUV in the description but it's looks more like a plastic throw back to the late 60s early 70s models of Little People houses/cars.The toy has lots of little buttons that activate the sounds.
While some may find the sounds cute, I find them rather annoying.
My 2-year-old is all boy and loves his trains, cars, and trucks.
I thought I would diversify his toys a little and get him something a bit more homey.
He has a blast with this house.
Of course he went for the car first, but he loves to play all the music and sing the baby to sleep.
He also has mommy and daddy go up and down the stairs.
It is so much fun to watch him imaginative play.I know the age range is 1-4 on this, but I think around 2 is going to start to give the most benefit as that is when imaginative play begins.
I see my little guy playing with this for quite a while and then his younger brother and sister (currently 6 months) will start to play with it.
This Fisher Price little people house is an improvement over my prior version (circa 2005).
The rooms are a nice size, easy for little hands to manipulate.
The new style of little people is easier to insert into the pegs, but older versions work too.
This house has lots to do and makes lots of interesting noises.
It also includes a car, although the car only fits 1 little person, not the whole family.
This set comes with Mom and Baby.
This set also attaches to other sets so you can connect a bunch of other playsets.
Much of the furniture is stuck in place, but there are a few removable pieces too.
All in all, this is a fun new twist on a classic!
Honestly, it's the perfect first birthday gift for a little girl.
Only negative?
I wish this set was not PINK.
There's no reason for this set to be gendered as little boys would love it too.
Fisher Price should have made the roof blue or yellow.Some assembly is required and you need a screw driver, but assembly is very easy and takes about 5 minutes.
We had a hard time getting our granddaughter to stop playing with this toy to go to bed.
If she had her way the whole thing would have went to bed with her.
The daddy toy went to bed and she ran right to the toy the next morning.
Music Nana!!
There are so many different features we are still discovering all this house has to offer.Batteries were included so this toy is ready to go right out of the box.
It is very well built and will last for years.
Nana has almost as much fun with it as the kids.
This house is cute but the pieces are a bit small for the intended age group in my opinion.
However, it seems to be popular among the toys in the living room and therefore I would say its a safe bet.
Just know that the colors are quite gender oriented with all the pink if that is an issue for you.
Overall seems pretty durable as well.
At first glance this is a cute and durable toy, but the colors really seemed aimed at girls.
Toddler boys might actually play with this if it wasn't mostly pink and purple.
The sound effects are cute, but may discourage kids from making up their own songs.
After a very short while, parents might be tempted to take the battery out.
The toy parents are stereotypical, middle-class Caucasians.
The mom has blonde hair and a pink shirt and the dad has brown hair and a V-neck sweater.
We're giving it a 1 for educational value because you may want to think about the message this is really teaching your kids.
If you want to expand your toddler's horizons, choose one of the other sets.
(As the box shows,the non-Caucasian toy kids don't have a house; they appear only in the playground and the grocery store sets.)
This house is adorable and there are a ton of things for my daughter to play with.
The sounds that it makes are cute and not annoying at all.
It comes with 3 little people, a father, mother and a baby as well as a little car to push them around in.
It's also not very big, so it's easy to store away when not in useOverall a very cute and fun toy that my daughter really enjoys.
We got this for my 21 month old daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it and all the Little People toys in general.
The house comes with the mom, dad, and baby girl, table, 2 seater car, and 2 links for other playsets (I find these to be pretty useless and we don't put them out).
The house was very easy and quick to put together and I like that you can add additional play sets to this home to make it a neighborhood (such as the Little People playground and garden sets).
We love the cheerful songs and the house sounds that each room makes, such as the sizzling pan in the kitchen, the phone, and my daughter especially loves the baby giggle sounds.
It seems as though the Little People figures are now taller and thinner, but what I love about this house is that many of the older style Little People figures still fit in the car and in the holes around the house, so it's a versatile set and is interchangeable.
For example, she has the Little People Disney Princess palace and all the princesses can fit in the house and vice versa so it extends the imaginative play use of the figures.There are a few things that are slightly disappointing like I wish that the house made more sounds and also the dial that says you turn from day to night sounds really doesn't have different sounds for the time of day other than singing a good morning or good night song when the baby cradle button is pushed.
I would like to have had more of a difference in the sounds as it claims it has.
Also, the furniture isn't moveable so that limits a little bit of play and doesn't leave a whole lot of room within the house to add other things/people.
The bed in the house is too short for the new thinner version of Little People figures so they can't really lay down which frustrates my daughter; the older Little People figures can fit properly in the bed and lay down.
Finally, I wish the car had an additional seat for the baby - it seems odd that it fits only the parents and they can't take the baby with them.Overall, I would recommend this as a starter dollhouse for toddlers and my daughter has enjoyed it for hours so far!
My toddler granddaughter enjoys this Little People house.
The people, furniture, and other moveable pieces are all a good size for her (not too small, easy to maneuver).
However, I can't help but compare it to the version that my daughter had (about 10 years ago).
It was so much better than this.
The quality of the house and pieces were much better, and there were more parts to it (this version has parts that used to be separate and are now made together, so it's not as versatile).
The household sounds are also different - fewer and not as realistic.
They've replaced them with songs, which are more of an annoyance than an improvement, in my opinion, and doesn't have the charm of the older version.
Overall it rates about four stars if I didn't take the previous version into account (lower than that if I did).
If you can find an older version that still has all the pieces, I'd really recommend it over this newer version.
So this house is strangely almost like this houseFisher Price Little People Happy SoundsThis was a Toys R Us exclusive and when I put them side by side, it's almost the same.
While I love Little People and have fond memories of playing with them as a child, I think that they should have done a better job at making something more different and not so confusingly similar.
If you have the same house, save your money and get something else.
There's not enough difference for me to fork out another $40.00
This is a really cute Fisher Price house.
My kids never had the old one, so I can't say if this one is better, but from what I've heard, this one is an upgrade.
Throughout the house, there are various buttons and things to press that will make sound effects and play songs.
The mother, father, and baby figures are very cute, and my daughter loves playing with them.
The only negatives about this toy is that the car only fits two people (what about the baby?)
and it comes with a couple gates to attach on the side of the house that are kind of useless.
Other than that, this is a great playhouse and definitely a good buy for little girls and boys.
This is a terrific toy for kids who like to play with little figures and make up stories about them.
The set comes with three little figures - Mom, Dad and Baby --  a house that opens up like a doll house, car, table, high chair, and two fence pieces.
These pieces allow the child to create all kinds of scenarios about the family and their adventures.
As with many such elaborate toys, additional sets can be purchased and added to the original.Geared for 1 to 4 year olds, the set has no pieces small enough to eat or get stuck in a child's throat.
All plastic parts are smooth, with no sharp edges or corners, making accidents less likely.
The box clearly indicates that adult assembly is required, but this is fairly simple with only a philips screwdriver needed.The fact that the house can be folded and the pieces kept inside is great for parents who don't want their kids' toys taking over the house.
When folded up, the house and contents can easily be stored in a closet or on a toy shelf, to be removed when the child is ready to play with it again.There are 12 songs that play with the push of a button.
This gives the playlet an interesting added feature, as many little ones respond positively to music and sound in general.
The volume is reasonable, so if your child endlessly repeats songs, you won't be driven crazy.
The playset is constructed solidly and looks able to withstand lots of handling, and occasionally mishandling, by young hands.As kids get older, they like more detailed figures.
The ones in this set are fairly simple, so if you have a three or four-year-old, you may want to consider a playset with more diverse characters and settings.
As a kid's first playhouse, however, the Fisher-Price Little People Happy Sounds Home is a good bet, though a bit pricey at close to $40.
