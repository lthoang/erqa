Top sentence(s):
My children create elaborate, imaginative scenarios with Barbie, her friends, her cars, her horses and some assorted, random furniture and I encourage that.Now, throw in this RV and you can take it all on the road.
); however, they really like the set-up of this big camper, and now, the Barbies have come back out.Not cheap, but it is a large, specialized item, birthday or Christmas appropriate.
I think ages 4 and up would be more appropriate.Overall this toy is lots of fun - a great way to go 'camping' with Barbie and her friends.
I definitely triple checked this and it wasn't an error on my end, probably a misprint on the manufacturer's end.
Barbie sure has come a long way since then!This folding RV set has so many features to explore that it will keep your girls occupied for hours.

Reviews:
I don't know exactly what I was expecting with this RV but whatever it was was certainly blown away when we received this!!
It is very large and has tons of features to provide endless fun for hours!!
The RV portion and the car easily come apart and can be used/played with separately.
The camper/RV unfolds and includes twin beds, kitchen, tv, seating areas, reversible campfire/hot tub/pool, stable and tons of accessories such as plates, cups, hot cocoa maker, even sticks with marshmallows!
The car easily seats 4 Barbies or 2 Barbies with a horse.When my 11 year old daughter and I opened the box, everything was simple and easy to assemble - the only actual assembly was putting the stickers where they belonged and that was simple enough.
Both of us were quite amazed by everything that was included and the size of the playset.
My daughter even commented that this was better than the Barbie Townhouse!
lol  Personally, this would have been a toy that I would have been over the moon excited with as a child....heck, I am excited about it as an adult, lol.
Tons of fun, durable and versitle, I highly recommend the Barbie and Her Sisters in a Pony Tale RV Vehicle!
!
"As a child in the 1980's, I had the Barbie Jeep with the Western-style horse trailer.
Barbie sure has come a long way since then!This folding RV set has so many features to explore that it will keep your girls occupied for hours.
My youngest daughter is entering first grade, and she thought this was better than the Dream House!This set has a folding horse stall, reversible campfire or hot tub, marshmallows on sticks the Barbies can really hold, beds to sleep four Barbies, seats for four Barbies to ride in (with seat belts, of course), a shower, toilet, full-length mirror, the kitchen cabinets open up to reveal a hot chocolate machine, a flat-screen TV that is positionable, and the car even expands out to be a horse trailer, too.As a treat for parents, this is a quiet toy, no sounds or noises or batteries to contend with.
There is minimal assembly required.
All I needed to do was spend ten minutes putting stickers in place and opening the bags of accessories.My girls were most impressed with the size of the set.
It measures 23"" long when all folded up and 12"" high.
When fully expanded, the set is as big as the entire first floor of the Dream House!A negative for the set is that it only fits the latest-model Barbie horses, like Tawny.
The older Barbie horses and Breyer horses are just too big for the trailer.
The folding stall will fit those horses, however, they just can't ride in the trailer.
My Little Pony horses and Breyer Stable Mates are a bit small for the set, but my girls didn't mind.
This just meant they could fit more!
Since the set only really fits the Tawny horse, it would have been nice if Tawny had been included instead of something that needed to be purchased separately.
What about a special edition Tawny that is only available with this set?I am very satisfied with the durability of this toy.
All of the wheels moved, all of the parts were easy to manipulate and position, and the accessories were crafted to stay in place."
My little girl has a friend who is our neighbor and they play almost everyday.
When we got this Barbie RV, she did not want to play with the neighbor, but the toy instead.
For a five year old, it is a blast.
All the extras like bowls, plates, eggs, milk, chandelier, pan, blanket, and toilet make it funnier!
"What can be better than ""glamping"" (glamorous camping)?
This RV has it all and was a hit with my kids.
It was easy to put together and had a good variety of ""extras"" for the kids to find.
The boys like racing it around the house (yes, it is durable) and they even let my daughter lead them on some camping adventures.
They eventually threw out the dolls and all decided they would like their mini stuff animals to enjoy the RV - so the animal camping began.This is a toy they go back to often and really allows for good, cooperative play.
Lots of gadgets to explore.
Well made (although not indestructible).
Would make a get gift for a Barbie fan, a girl that loves camping, and a cooperative toy for several children to share.
I was honestly surprised by all the various things they included, whomever designed this RV is very familiar with RVing - they really thought of most aspects of road tripping."
This is a great camper.
It's a lot of fun, has tons of play features and at the right price is a good buy as far as play sets go.
Here are the pros and cons as I see them.Pros:* Completely unfolds with beds and play features all over.
Beds, couch, kitchenette, picnic table and a full bathroom with a shower and a toilet.
(The toilet kinda threw me but hey, it's just like a real camper.
)* Car front detaches and has three modes.
2 seater, 4 seater, and 2 seater with horse trailer.
* Stickers are large and of high quality.
* Kitchen accessories  plug into the tables so they're not flying around the camper when folded up.
* Completely folds up into a self-contained unit that makes  storage and travel, like taking it to Grandma's, much easier.Cons:* Plastic is somewhat thin.
I understand economics and making sure you can meet a price point, but I am a tad disappointed in the thickness of the camper exterior.
My daughter has already cracked the roof so I do have reservations about durability.Debatable:* Size and price.
This is a very large set and it isn't cheap.
* Color.
This is a Barbie set, I get that and so I deduct zero points for it being pink.
Pink IS Barbie.
As a general rule I am not fond of toys that do all of the playing for a child.
Some might classify Barbie as one of those toys, but as I have listened to my children play with Barbies over the years I have to strongly disagree.
My children create elaborate, imaginative scenarios with Barbie, her friends, her cars, her horses and some assorted, random furniture and I encourage that.Now, throw in this RV and you can take it all on the road.
Where will they go?
How will they get there?
What will they do when they get there?
Should they cram as much as possible in the RV?
(yes, of course!)
Will all of the other Barbies cram into the cars and make it an All-Star Barbie road trip?
Heck, yeah - it's  a caravan across the house!
"Short of an actual dollhouse, this is about the largest ""play area"" you can buy for Barbie type (12 inch tall) fashion dolls (I previously wrote this about theBarbie Sisters Cruise Ship, but this toy is even larger!)
and will make a marvelous gift for a Barbie or Barbie type fashion doll fanatic, but there are some limitations to be aware of, some minor annoyances worth mentioning.First, there are (IMHO) a ridiculous number of stickers to be applied, several of which either because of large size or position are going to be very difficult to apply properly, and thus should probably be applied by parents, preferably with plenty of time set aside...and in complete sound isolation so as not to increase your children's vocabulary in unfortunate ways.
In addition in at least a couple of places the sticker applying instructions are clearly wrong: the pink rear light sticker instructions are backwards (big ones go on the pickup, small ones on the RV), and I think the side mirror sticker numbers were reversed.Second, this play set (based on the upcoming movieBarbie & Her Sisters in A Pony Tale) comes with no dolls or horses itself.
If the child in question already has both, no problem; other wise theBarbie and Her Sisters in a Pony Train and Ride Horse Playsetwith the remote control horse would be IMHO an excellent addition.Third, when folded up into an RV, some of the legs of the furniture project a bit and drag slightly.
In practice what this means is that there will be no launching the RV and having it roll all the way across the room; it will roll where it is pushed and no further.
(You will have to decide whether this is good or bad.
)Folding and unfolding is pretty straightforward and simple (though I'd advise keeping the instructions!
); one nice feature is that the dishes and other items can for the most part be left fastened in place when you fold it up, preventing the need to just dump them in the cab as shown in the instructions.
As shown on the box, but not in the instructions, the fully extended cab/pickup can hold a horse in the back, standing over the necessarily unoccupied rear seats.All in all a remarkable toy!"
"The only negative I noticed with putting this together with my daughter is that sticker sets 19, 20 & 21,22 were reversed, something that I wanted to get out there to other parents hopefully before they made the mistake we did with applying the first sticker in the wrong spot, oops!
I definitely triple checked this and it wasn't an error on my end, probably a misprint on the manufacturer's end.
Not a huge deal, I still am giving the toy 5 star's overall, but definitely something I wanted, needed to point out to other consumers first and foremost!That said, this is an awesome toy and my daughter, Ella, who is 7 and growing quite accustomed to my reviewing (and her getting free toys), said she loves it and thinks it's a lot of fun and that she likes that there's lots of room for her dolls (Barbie's, Monster High, Moxie, Bratz and even smaller dolls joined the RV trip) although the recommended doll space is 4, always leave it to kids to find more space and fill it with their dolls!This was super easy to put together and Ella was excited, and quite able, to help in most areas.
She especially liked the way it transformed.
(She also has the Barbie boat that does that, but she really likes this more as the boat is just a boat that kinda folds up for storage then opens for play whereas this folds up into an RV she can drives around with the dolls inside with actual seatbelts, then unfolds for play).
Also, when unfolding for play, it also has transforming areas,  The bunkbeds fold up into a wall with ""windows looking out"", the traveling horse area opens into a stable, a picnic table unfolds for play and the top of the RV comes off for additional seating.
The kitchen area itself is really neat, opening cupboards reveal a cocoa maker which she can push down on to ""make cocoa"", and included are four hot cocoa mugs and a ""whipped cream container"", also, my personal favorite, the four sticks with double marshmallows, which look so real I almost wanted to try and taste the marshmallows!
Plus a firepit which my daughter immediately flipped over and said it turned into a hottub as well, lol.But the coolest, most innovative part about this new barbie set are the lego type ""holes"" everywhere in which the mugs, food and plates easily fit into for play.
As we all know as parents, the most frustrating thing about any kid's toys are the little pieces.
They get lost, stepped on by our feet ""ouch!
"", and, when our kids are playing with them, frustrate the kids as they fall of their Barbie tables, etc.
No more!
This new playset introduces this lego type feature of clicking everything into it's place!
Even in the little oven and fridge, you can ""click"" the food into place for play!
So when she's done playing, and it's time to put this up, the little pieces don't get lost along the way!
It's inventive, innovative, and definitely what get's this toy five stars and raises it above all the rest!
My niece was SO excited about receiving this toy.
The sheer size of this product is awe inspiring.
The camper has tons of features: bathroom, horse trailer, camp fire, television, etc.
My niece is 4, and she played with this for hours.
She wanted to take it on trips too.
So why the average rating?
The plastic that they used is thin.
I imagine part of that reason is because it would be so heavy given the size of the camper, but the flimsiness has already started to cause problems.
The mirrors on the camper have come off after three days of play, and several other smaller parts to the camper are feeling precariously loose.
With the hefty price tag, I would want a product that is going to last.
Perhaps if the intended receiver was older this would not be such a big issue, but if she is on the younger end of the spectrum, you may have problems.
Overall, this is a fun toy, but I doubt the longevity of it.
"Life is very good for Barbie.
Corvette convertibles, cruise ships, horses, etc etc and now she's got an RV as well.
My 7-year old daughter happily added this to her Barbie collection.
Life is good for kids in America.
I found this to be another cool Barbie product - comes stocked with all the goodies Barbie would need for some celebutant camping - bedding, dinnerware, firepit/hot tub time machine and even the roasted marshmallows to go along with it.
The coolest feature (at least for Dad) is the detachable James Bond-esque convertible cab that Barbie can detach and use for day trips.My daughter's had fun playing Barbie RV and I like the fact that all the accessories can be packed up inside the RV when done.
On the cons side is the fact that this thing is made of flimsy plastic so I'm not sure how it will hold up over time - there is sort of a ""Barbie junk yard"" at the bottom of my daughter's toy chest with dislodged pieces from various Barbie products over the years - maybe we can build some radical new Barbie creation.
And my biggest pet peeve - the dreaded sticker sheet - I don't think I've ever successfully/cleanly applied all the stickers to a new Barbie product and thus making me appear to be a weak man in the eyes of my daughter.So at $75 a bit expensive for alot of plastic and stickers that come together to form that Barbie secret recipe - my kid likes it so it's worth it to me.
Overall I give 4-stars in consideration of price/value."
As a kid, I remember playing Barbies with my sister and spending endless time just setting up shoe boxes and bookshelves to create our own Barbie home and office.
It seemed to take forever, and I was always too bored to play once we finally decided what everything in our bedroom had transformed to for the sake of our Barbie play.
On the one hand, it was a great use of the imagination; on the other hand, it made for a lot of rearranging and cleaning up afterward.
What I wouldn't have given then to have this RV vehicle!This is an amazingly simple yet versatile playset for Barbie lovers.
The front car of the RV can detach and expand to turn into a car or a horse trailer.
It seats four full-sized Barbie dolls fairly easily.
The trailer portion of the RV opens both upward and outward to reveal just about everything a Barbie could want.
There's a bedroom, living room, kitchen, dining area, and horse stall.
I usually dread when we get my daughter a new Barbie or playset that comes with tiny little pieces that can be easily lost.
So, I was a little awed and quite pleasantly surprised at how the tiny little accessories in this set are designed with pieces that allow them to snap into place.
The pillows, for example, snap onto the bed; and the little refrigerator has a pull-out rack that the milk, juice, and egg carton can snap onto.
Likewise, the table, counters, and stovetops allow kids to snap accessories on and make them a little less likely to be lost than otherwise.
These snaps aren't quite as secure as, say, Legos, but they are secure enough that when my two-year old takes his sister's RV for a spin around the house, he doesn't leave a trail of Barbie stuff behind.My 7-year-old daughter loves this thing.
The design is such that you can't completely reconfigure it, but you can make some adjustments into the size of the car or how the RV opens up into other rooms.
After receiving this almost a month ago, she comes home and wants to play with it just about every day.
It didn't come with any dolls, but it really works with every Barbie possible.
"When I was a little girl, I had a Barbie camper and remember spending hours playing with it.
In fact, I still have mine!
I wished there was a camper for my own daughters because they still love their Barbies (at ages 10 - 12) but I didn't want to give them mine to use, they're a little rough on toys and my camper is a (little bit) old!So when I saw this one, I knew we had to try it out.
It's marketed as an ""RV"" now-a-days and also includes a horse trailer.First of all, this is one HUGE toy.
It's like the size of six typical sized shoe boxes, stacked two high and then laid end-to-end.
And that's when it's folded away!
Secondly, it took a long time for us to put it together.
There weren't really any directions on where the stickers were supposed to go, so we had to use the photo on the box and a lot of guesswork.
There was a bit of assembly, for which there were directions, but it wasn't too big of a deal.Now to the fun part:  Is it fun to play with?
Yes!
Even me, being a woman of a certain age, still enjoyed playing with this for a little while.
It's really cute because instead of it being a solid single piece like from when I was young, it's more like a tractor/trailer type deal.
So you can detach the tractor part off and the back folds down with some seats and the Barbies can go cruisin' the town.
It folds down even further to include the horse, but I don't know how the girls sitting in the back feel about having a horse bu-t in their faces.
I know I'd not be too keen on that.The back of the trailer part folds down into a horse stall for Buttercup (that's the name of the horse my daughters have)  Which is right next to the fold down eating area for the girls.
I guess that's pretty convenient because then they can easily share their scraps with Buttercup.
The Barbie and her sisters RV is awesome.
It is big and sturdy and when it opens up forget about it...amazing.
The beds, the kitchen, bathroom, even the toilet just call for you to play, play, play and let me tell you, I am all about keeping the kids unplugged as much as possible.
Any toy that takes them away from the TV, Kindle, computer or video games is great.The camper removes from the cab which seats four dolls or can tow a horse and two dolls.
As for the camper we love the multiple play areas including the pool/fire pit depending on which side you use.The camper is chock full of fun play pieces including marshmallows on sticks.
Love it!
We love that everything folds up and all the extra accessories.We have played with it every day and any little girl who has come over asks to play with it before anything else.
What's not to love about this very pink, very fun girl toy?
!
"I'm jealous: when do we get the fullsize family version of this parked out front?
This transforming, mega, almost all pink, fully loaded RV convert to pick-up-horse stall-camper/home has everything a Barbie fanatic could dream of except you must bring your own dolls and animals.It arrives in a picture box with handle.
So, save the box.
Dad was not overwhelmed by assembly.
The camper's pretty good size and, of course, cute.
The pink pick-up releases from the camper which opens up into another world of flip down bunk beds, kitchen with featured hot cocoa maker, table with bench seating for four, TV screen, bathroom with shower and curtain, toilet, a blue campfire pit that can also be used as a small pool(Oh, come on!
), and a place for the horse by the camper or in the back of the truck.Called Sisters' Deluxe Camper, it lives up to its name, and our two young ""sisters"" love it.
They enjoy the Barbie movies more than play with the dolls- lately it's been Monster High Girls and American Girls(Gulp, $$$!
); however, they really like the set-up of this big camper, and now, the Barbies have come back out.Not cheap, but it is a large, specialized item, birthday or Christmas appropriate.
My wife keeps the small accessories in a ziplock, and tries to keep all the little things, of all the different themed toys, together.
Good luck with that.
And perhaps, if I keep working and saving until I'm 80, I can get that fullsized version of this RV.
Good luck with that!"
Well, where to begin.Of all the Barbie stuff I've seen over the years, this is probably the most extensive and fun of them all.
It's kind of like Bacchanalia for five-year-old girls - a peptol-pink explosion of merriment and good times that will provide your child with endless hours of enjoyment and entertainment.
Don't worry about hiring a babysitter.
This RV set will more than suffice (not that I advocate leaving your child or anything like that.Others have aptly described in greater detail what to expect from this set, so I'll just add my two cents that this is probably one of the more fun and exciting Barbie sets you're likely to find.
Yes, it's a little on the high side as far as prices go, but it'd make a nice centerpiece on Christmas morning.
This was great entertainment for my granddaughter we went camping and I surprised her with this and she had so much fun with it It was like she had her friends camping with her :)
Barbie is ready to hit the road with her sisters and her horse in this deluxe RV vehicle, inspired by the up-coming new Barbie movie.
My 5-year old was over the moon when this toy arrived - she couldn't wait to have an adventure.This arrived in a LARGE box, and the box it arrives in is clearly  marked with what is inside, so if you're ordering as a gift or don't want your neighbors knowing what you're getting than you might want to make alternate delivery plans.
There is some minor assembly required and stickers that need to be applied to the RV, so if you have a little one who will be too impatient to play with this then you might want to plan to apply stickers and assemble pieces ahead of time.The RV vehicle is compact and folds up nicely, but even when folded it's still a large toy.
When it's opened up there is lots for Barbie and her sisters/friends to do, everything from relaxing in the hot/tub, enjoying a cup of hot cocoa and roasting marshmallows by the campfire, watch some tv, even nap in the beds or take a shower.
There is even a special 'stall' for the horse to join them in the living area.The front of the RV vehicle detaches for more fun - Barbie can go for a ride and even take the horse along in the back of the vehicle.
I liked that Mattel thought to include seat belts in the vehicle - it's such a small detail but I think an important one.The manufacturer recommended minimum age is 3, but I don't think your typical 3-year old would be able to enjoy all of the features of this toy such as opening and closing the RV, detaching the front part for additional play.
I think ages 4 and up would be more appropriate.Overall this toy is lots of fun - a great way to go 'camping' with Barbie and her friends.
I do think the price is a bit high, considering this does not come with any dolls or horses.
Yes it is a large toy, and it does come with lots of little accessories, but it would have been nice if they had included one horse or doll with the set for the price.
"Barbie RV is a huge toy with lots of accessories.
The only thing missing are the dolls (and the pony) itself.
The RV is based on the new Barbie movie ""Barbie and Her Sisters in a Pony Tale"".You will have to attach a lot of stickers and here is where your kids, depending on their age, needs help.
The stickers are very hard to remove once they sticked.
I messed up a couple of times and they ripped when I tried to reposition them.
So, be very careful to make sure to stick them at the right place the first time.My 7-year old daughter loves it.
It has table and bench, cooking range and oven, folding bed (double-deck), bathtub, toilet and shower, couch, large screen HDTV, big mirror, juice dispenser and even has a pink chandelier.
Also included are cups and plates, cereal boxes, milk, hangers, eggs on a tray, perfume bottle and marshmallows on a stick.The front part of the truck can be used in itself as a separate car or if you pull the back can be extended to carry a horse.
There are four seats with safety belts.Despite the many moving parts, it seems to be sturdy enough to hold some abuse from my daughter and a couple of little toddlers that my wife is taking care in her daycare."
"We have TONS of Barbie items here, and I had thought that my 9 year old daughter was beyond the age of Barbie.I was wrong!We got the Barbie RV to review and let me tell you, even I was impressed!PROS:- Tons of space!
The new RV has tons of space in it.
Once you unfold it you'll find room for THREE Barbies to sleep (one has to be one of Barbie's little sisters, though) and room to go to the bathroom as well as to cook a meal and eat dinner!
My daughter especially loved that the toilet moved and literally giggled for about an hour after realizing that!- Rolls great!
The RV rolls easily on the car no matter if you're going over carpet or hardwood.- Love the car!
The car is fantastic as it can be used either to haul the camper or to haul Barbie and her family!
You can fit 4 people in the car when the trailer is not attached, and 2 if it is attached.- Lots of little things!
We noticed all sorts of little bonus things in this RV, like the ""hot cocoa"" maker and the plates and cups you get.
It even includes a few sticks for Smores!CONS:- When we got this I originally believed that it was possible to haul the trailer AND the horse at the same time.
As far as we've found, it's not.
You can only haul the trailer OR put the horse in the back of the car.
You can't do both.
How, then, is the horse supposed to get to any events?- STICKERS!!
OH.
MY.
GOSH.
"Barbie Sisters' Deluxe Camper is a lot of fun in one box.
Though priced a little high, your child will surely delight in everything that this has to offer.
It brings back happy memories of my own Barbie days.
The car detaches and seats four, the camper/horse trailer is where the fun is.
Note: does NOT come with dolls or horses.
It does come with lots of little toys including a hot chocolate maker, The ""campfire"" pulls double-duty and flips over into a swimming pool.
Barbie and her sisters will have many adventures in this fun filled toy.
Bright and cheerful colors help add to the fun.
I really like this one."
The first thing my niece & I noticed is that this is pretty large.
She was very excited to play with this, we don't have any of the sisters but she has a million Barbies and she didn't even notice that it says Barbie and her sisters.This takes some time to put together (stickers), but when you have a 7 yr old eager to put it together, it's pretty fun and it's time well spent.The only thing I personally didn't like is how thin the plastic is, for the 80+ price tag, I think it should be thicker.All in all we had a blast playing with this and she asks about it every time I see her.
This thing is big.
But that makes sense because Barbie is fairly tall and she does need to be able to properly sit in the car or lie in the bed.
If your child wants a Barbie house but you have limited space in your house or apartment, the Barbie RV would be an ideal compromise.The RV effectively comes fully assembled, minus all of the detailing on the inside and outside of the vehicle which must be applied as stickers.
Which there are a lot of, and some go in tricky places where it's hard to get them straight.
(Pro tip: If it's important to your child for the stickers to be straight, don't let your child do the application.
)Overall my daughter has spent a lot of time playing with this even though she has a real dollhouse as well.
I'd call that a success.Pros:- has many of the same amenities of dollhouse play: bed, bathroom, kitchen, dining table, tv, etc- detachable car for zooming around the living room- large play area when fully expanded- reasonably compact when closed upCons:- can be unwieldy due to size- difficult to get all of the stickers on straight- can be hard to master getting everything closed up at first
My 8 year old daughter loves all things Barbie so I couldn't wait to get this!
She was ecstatic when it came- just in time for her birthday.
I let her open and assemble the RV and she managed to do it all without my help by following the directions.
So it is easy enough to put together.
There are a lot of small pieces (just an FYI) and it turns out to be quite a large toy.
My daughter and her friends are thoroughly enjoying it.
If you have a Barbie fan, then this is the ultimate piece to add to their collection.
This RV is huge, pleasantly and surprisingly.
It includes quite a bit of accessories, all extremely well made and durable.
Hardly anything to do out of the box except for applying the various stickers that come with it.
It would be nice if at least one doll was included, but it's not surprising that isn't the case.
The front of the RV seperates and turns into a car of sorts that fit two adult Barbies and a couple of kids in the back.
There really is quite a bit to keep any child entertained and busy for a good while.
Any little girl over 3 probably will have a blast with this.
It just pains me to see how expensive toys can be though!
I appreciate the idea behind this toy - pack many features and a large play space into a comparably small product that can be folded away.
There are many, many features, such as the smores fire that reverses to a swimming pool, an RV that turns into a horse truck and an RV, beds that become sofas, and many more.
It comes with quite a few accessories and lots of built in furniture.
My main complaint with this is the whole thing is flimsy.
Barbies CAN sit on the benches, but they must be carefully placed and the RV not bumped in the slightest way or the whole thing will jiggle like jello and knock the Barbie off her perch.
The beds are the same way.The picnic table has notches for the accessories to lock into and you realize why right away.
The whole thing is very wobbly!I consider it a better buy than the Barbie town house.
It has a built in bathroom with toilet, shower, beds, sofa, picnic table and benches, a kitchen, a pool, and a vehicle.
Plus it can be stored away so that it doesn't occupy valuable bedroom floor space.
Given the wobbliness, it's not something I would buy for my daughter, but if you are familiar with current Barbie toy quality and it is acceptable to you, then this is a great value compared to many of the other Barbie sets available.
