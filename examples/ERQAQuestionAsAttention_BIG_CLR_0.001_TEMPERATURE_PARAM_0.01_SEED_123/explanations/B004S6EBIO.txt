Top sentence(s):
The optional sound box makes it easier to decide whether you want to install it in the first place (we didn't).
Assembly is just a bit of a pain.
We got them on, but it wasn't easy at all.
So, it is not a major complaint.
It took about ten minutes and my 2-year old grandson was able to help.

Reviews:
This is nice, engaging first car driving toy for a youngster.
It was easy to put together, although the wheels take a bit of elbow grease to get on.
But once on they are sturdy.
It has a fun, well-thought out twist, with the inflatable ball under the seat.
That extra bit of bouncy fun at least for our daughter has her asking for it more than she would otherwise.I find the music fine to listen to as an adult, for a reasonably short period of time, and again it engages our daughter and she obviously likes it.
There is also reasonable educational value as there are many different colors you can point out, green wheel, orange wheel, etc.
And of course motor skill teaching is a valuable thing.
Lastly it feels solid and everything fit very well.
A recommended around 1 year old and up great gift or parent treat as a first car experience.
This is a really clever concept to add an inflatable rubber ball under the seat and on top of that silly sound effects that makes the bouncing more fun.
There are a wide variety of sounds and they mostly come on when you first get on, so it doesnt get annoying.Its really cute and my 19-month old, who is not normally into riding toys, really likes this.
She can get right on and off easily, and it handles really well on our low carpet.
The handles are stable, and most importantly the vehicle has an even center of gravity so I'm not worried that it will flip over.
It comes with a pump for the ball and assembly was super easy.
I think its a great value and it is something that a child won't too quickly outgrow.
This is a great little ride on toy.
I would say the ideal age for this is one years old.
My girls are almost 2 and 4 and while they enjoyed it, it was my 1 year old nephew who really took to it and was sized appropriately for it.The bounce part is fun but the real genius of the design in my opinion is the monkey that swings on the handle.
All of the kids loved spinning it around and around.The noises are cute and irritating at the same time.
Thankfully they did equip this toy with an on/off button.
The scotter was hard to assemble, we had to push the wheels so hard to attach them that we were worried we would snap the axle.
We got them on, but it wasn't easy at all.
The ball was a breeze to assemble.
My little guys loves bouncing up and down on the seat.
There are fun noises that go off everytime he bounces.
It's definitely a cool toy, I am just not sure how durable that inflatable ball is going to be.
Another plus is that it comes with batteries, ready to go.
Assembly is just a bit of a pain.
Not too many pieces, they just hard to snap into place.
I'd been gifted another Playskool ride-on toy that my little guy learned to walk with and still loves scooting around on at 19mos.I loved that this ride-on combines the scooting with bouncing and music.
I WISH they had this out when he was closer to the recommended 12mos start age.He would have gotten much more regular use out of it.As it is, he still loves the bouncy, sound combination, but not as often as if we'd received this when he was younger.Highly recommend for the 12mo crowd.
All babies love to bounce!
I think this is a really novel way to combine two favorite baby activities into one toy: bouncing and scooting!
There are a lot of ride on toys out there that have all kinds of flash and sounds going on, but my baby always seemed to love the simple ones best and this one is no exception.
It is clearly made of high quality materials and will last through many years of play.
The ball under the seat is very substantial and I have no worry of it bursting or wearing over time.
We've had a number of bouncy ball riders in our house and they do let air out over time, but the included pump is all you need to quickly fix that.
My only concern would be to make sure you don't let the ball get too low on air or I could see the toy tipping over.
Overall, this is a lot of simple (quiet!)
fun for the given age range.
"My son enjoyed this for a day and I guess the novelty wore off.
He is 19 months old and based on this experience, he may have grown out of this kind of toy even before we gave it to him.
I suggest giving it to a (just barely) slightly younger child.
It is small, colorful, and musical.
Its size may have something to do with his choice to ride his other toys instead.A word of note to parents trying to put this together...
If you put the wheels on backwards, they are very difficult to get off.
As the saying goes, ""measure twice, cut once.""
Similarly, read the directions twice, and put it together once.
Make sure you put the wheels on with the pictures facing out, or they dont turn.
They also require a lot of force to put on, even when facing the correct way."
"I recently bought aGaiam Balance Ball Chairwhich requires/allows slight adjustment movements as you sit in it.
The bounciness is reminiscent of this ""Bounce & Ride"".
If the big chair is fun for me, I know the Bounce & Ride is fun for my 2-y-o nephew.Bless the manufacturers for including an OFF switch for the sound.
If this toy is going to live in your home, there will be times when you bless the makers similarly."
Assembly:Straight out of the box, this toy comes with quite a few parts and tools.
This is the most difficult toy I ever put together and that's saying a lot.
I'm beginning to get a bias against Playskool toys because they seem to be overly complex in execution.Fun rating:My one year olds enjoyed pushing this around on their knees as it's quite small.
They also enjoy the bouncing seat and use that as a drum.
It isn't a great walking toy because of the awkward positioning required for babies to hold the bars and walk.
I don't think it'll be a great riding toy because it's already too low for a one year old's height.
The Playskool Poppin' Park Bounce and Ride comes with everything you need to make this easy to assemble.
It took about ten minutes and my 2-year old grandson was able to help.
The bouncy seat is a great feature, my grandson loves it.
The plastic wheels on this toy go easily across carpeted floors which is not the case with all toys with wheels, but it makes this an especially good indoor scooter.
My grandson likes to sit on it and bounce along to the music as he watches Sesame Street.
The ball is soft enough to bounce well but sturdy enough to withstand the constant bouncing.
This is a good toy for active learners who like to keep on the move during the day.
"I got the Playskool Poppin' Park Bounce and Ride for my two-year-old.
He seems to really like it.
I opted not to install the sound box.
As a stay-at-home mom, toys that make a lot of noise can become irritating after listening to them for 12 hours a day, lol.
On a positive note, this toy does have an off switch which allows you to turn off the sound.
It was reasonably easy to install, although I did have a little bit of difficulty installing the handlebar.
You basically just snap all of the plastic parts together.
I was kind of afraid that if I tried too hard to push it in I might break it, but it eventually went in without any trouble.
You do have to push pretty hard to get the pieces to fit together.
There are no tools required (apart from a screwdriver to install the sound box).My son really seems to enjoy his ""bouncy bike.""
It's almost too small for him to ride (he's 25 months), but I think it would be the perfect size for a 18 month old."
Like most toys for this age group, this one can easily provide a fun distraction for a short time.
The bright colors, different colored wheels (a real pain to assemble - had to use all my strength to snap the wheels on), a sturdy bouncer ball, and a little monkey - make this a fun toy.
The seating area is a little too narrow, especially for a kid who may be still in diapers, but the intent of course is to use both legs to support in scooter-like movement or bouncing.
So, it is not a major complaint.
The pump that comes with the toy is excellent (ended up using it as the primary pump for other toys/applications).
The optional sound box makes it easier to decide whether you want to install it in the first place (we didn't).
The revolving monkey in the handle bar was the biggest attraction for a 10 month old (yes, the suggested range is 12 months+), since it is difficult for him to stably sit on the narrow seat and bounce...but is learning to support himself and walk.
Overall, a fun toy.
