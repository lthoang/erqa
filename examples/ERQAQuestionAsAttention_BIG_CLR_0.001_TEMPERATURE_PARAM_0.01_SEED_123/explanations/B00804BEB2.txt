Reviews:
My little ones have had some fun with this.
It's not quite as simple as it first looks.
It has a mode where it names the objects as the kids touch the picture and a mode that asks the kids to find and touch something specific.
It also plays a couple of songs, including Old Macdonald that lets the kids pick the animals for the song.
"I received this item via Amazon Vine and promptly gave it to my (then) 17 month old.
He already has theLeapFrog Touch Magic Learning Bus, Retailwhich he likes a lot, too.This is a big hit.
He could mostly count to 10 when he got this toy, but can now count to 20 because of it (he's 21 months).
He has a lot of fun listening to all the activities, counting, finding things (""find 10 dark red raspberries!""
""find something that makes the sound 'woof woof!'"")
and counting along with the toy.
It was super easy for him to learn how to use, and once we showed him where the on/off button was, he also has a great time turning it on and off himself (as well as changing the modes).
The one downside is that after he gets to 20, he claps, says, ""Yeah!
Did it!""
(the train says ""Yeah, you did it!
"")The biggest pro: no raised buttons for little hands to pick at and try to pull off.
This also means it's impervious to surface water/spilled beverages, sticky fingers, boogies, and other various fluids.
It wipes off easily.
It's very light, so it's easy for them to tote around or to put in a backpack to take along.From an adult standpoint, it's not very annoying and only has one bit of music that has ended up as an earworm.
And my son plays with this toy at least 4-5 times a week, usually for at least a 1/2 hour at a time.Cons: it's very sensitive and sometimes turns on when we or one of our cats walk past.
Since it's usually in a cubby in my son's room at night, it's disconcerting to hear ""Welcome to the Magic Counting Train!""
"I love these Leap Frog Touch Magic toys!
First of all, this is so sensitive that just a touch of little fingers is all it takes to play with this!It helps little ones learn to count from 1 to 20.
But ANYTHING they touch on this toy makes a noise, saying what it is, with cute sound effects, like crunchy lettuce.
There is even a xylophone on the front of the train that little fingers can play on.In the various modes little ones can go on a search for various items.
Everything is interconnected.
For instance, it isn't just ""find blueberries"" it is ""find 8 blueberries"" which builds vocabulary and counting skills.My favorite mode is where the child gets to help make the song ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm"".
They get to pick what animal to use in each verse.
So cute!In summary, this is a very useful learning toy that encourages learning in several different areas simultaneously.
Plus it is easy touch for small fingers.
I would definitely recommend this!"
"My 4 yr old grandson loves it and my almost 1 yr old grandson does too.
Very good educational toy for numbers especially but there are many more games on it.The little one likes all the music that's played.Seems to be a ""tough"" toy.
Busy children can be rough but this feels as though it can take a lot.
Very light weight too.Just a fun toy and the education is made fun!"
This Leapfrog Touch Magic Counting Train is another great toy for preschoolers.
My 2 year old toddler is having fun with it.
I thought it might be too young for him since he knows his numbers, etc, but he will sit down with it and enjoys the music and the animals.
He treats it as if it was his laptop!
It is VERY sturdy and withstands preschool playing.
I think it would be fun for ages 18 months on through probably 3!
This delightful toy helps with number recognition and is also a fun sing-along.
The row of animals can be touched for the old McDonald sing a long and will make the animal sound for the child.
The numbers only go from one to twenty, but that is a great starting point for very young children.
The toy is also easy to clean after messy fingers touch it.
With the bright colors it is great stimulation for toddlers and helps them with counting, animal names and sounds, vocabulary and motor skills.
I believe a child would play with this a long time without getting bored.
We got this for our nearly three year old son and he loved it.
A big part of the allure is how the toy plays a game where it will announce a number, food, or animal and the child must press the right spot on the screen.
We found the screen to be very responsive, which was important because responsiveness really seemed to be the essence of the toy.
The toy is light enough that a two year old could handle it.Our son really liked this and I highly recommend it to you.
This toy has great potential, but my 2 year old is just not at all interested.
He regularly uses an ipad and iphone, so he completed understands the touch screen concept.
However, whenever I put this in front of him he just turns it off and walks away.
He isn't interested in the songs or sounds.
I can't figure it out.
I think I have played with it a lot more than he has.
It is a pretty neat little toy.
You can even play a little game where they want you to find an object and you have to press it.
I can't figure out if he is just slightly to young to want to sit with it, or if he just doesn't like it.
Maybe a 2.5-3yr old would enjoy it more?
I'm not ready to give up on it (like I was with the touch magic guitar) so I will try to bring it out again in a few more months and see what happens.
I got this counting toy for my 2.5 year old and it held his interest for about a day.
My major issue with it is its one-dimensionality.
It's really rather a boring looking toy.
Just a flat piece of plastic.
It's nice for learning numbers and animals and sing-a-long songs, but again, I feel the design detracts from the appeal of the toy.
It seems a little overpriced in my opinion.
I am a big fan of Leapfrog in general, but this one seems to have fallen just short of the mark.
Adding some dimensions to this toy would lend to the tactile experience children often rely upon for learning.
The Leapfrog counting train is probably my 8 month old's favorite toy.
It is sturdy and takes a lot of abuse, including him putting all of his weight on it.
It counts and has a lot of different songs.
It's not annoying, takes up barely any space because it's pretty flat.
He really enjoys it.
The power button is kind of small so we have to activate it for him - once it's on he can easily keep himself occupied for quite some time.
Highly recommend!
Several different options on the LeapFrog Magic Train depending on the skill level of your child.
My son, who is three, loves to take the Magic Train in the car with him to use on our drive.
It's also not one of those electronic noise toys that I'm always looking for the off switch on, not grating or annoying - at least to me, which is a BONUS.
Overall very good learning toy.
A+
Very Colorful and attractive to younger kids, not too loud which I was definitly worried about.
I picked this up for my two year old niece and she took to it right away, repeating everything she pressed, she really loves it.
There are a lot of different buttons and phrases and even though Lily pressed and played with it for quite some time it didn't seem to be too repetitive which was very good!
Highly recommended for little ones, great educational toy!
Leapfrog does it again!
The touch sensitivity is very good.
It's far better than I expected.
There are two settings for volume.
The low setting is not too loud which is a plus, since many young child toys are far too loud.
The picture is friendly and brightly colored.
It's also lightweight and easy for a young child to carry.Pro: Good touch sensitivityPro: brightly coloredPro: Good quality soundPro: LightweightCon: no actual buttons
"My two little boys, almost 3 and 4.5, have been playing off and on with this toy for a few weeks now.
I have no complaints about it.
It is sturdy, colorful, and enjoyable to play with.
Since it doesn't have any buttons, pretty much anywhere you touch on the face makes something happen; so it's kind of like a tablet computer with just one image, and much less costly.With all the animals on the picture, LeapFrog came up with a cool variation of ""Old MacDonald.""
The toy starts singing the song, then when you get to the part where you sing about a particular animal, it asks the child to pick which animal to sing about.
When s/he presses on one, the song continues with that animal.The batteries are still going after occasional use over the course of a few weeks, so I'd say the toy is not a battery hog.Since my boys have come back to this toy more than most, I'd say it has good value and I recommend it as a gift for any young child."
"This is an adorable preschool sing-along toy.
It teaches colors, shapes, animals, numbers up to 20, and more.
It encourages the child to touch various things in the picture and reinforces the learning by repeating what they touched, whether they got it right or not.
I loved the ""harmony"" on the ABC song, which makes it not as annoying as some little-kid-singing toys.
Our little 3-year-old friend loves to play with this when he is at our house.
Would be a good toy to take along in the car, too."
"The Touch Magic Counting Train is a great toy for learning to count to 20 and recognize the numbers 1-20.
As homeschoolers, we like anything that helps get cognitive skills across in a fun way.
Our preschooler can effortlessly learn her numbers and counting now.
And since ""Old MacDonald"" is one of her favorite songs, this toy really has appeal for her.
The fact that there are songs involved is also a big plus for her because her enjoyment of anything musical in unsurpassed in this household.
Anything with music is tailor-made for this little miss.
There are many counting / number toys on the market but LeapFrog has made this one of the most enjoyable.
Thank you LeapFrog for another wonderful learning product."
I was so happy to see this item in my vine newsletter.
I have been looking for items for my 10 month old niece's upcoming one year birthday.
I have never had children of my own, so I was finding it quite difficult to find a toy that was suitable for her.
Leap frog to the rescue!
Not only are the leap frog Toys suitable for any age they  specifically target an educational experience for the child Who receives them.
The leapfrog magic touch counting train was no exception as I watched my niece eagerly touch, create and discover new tunes and numbers!
Thanks leapfrog for making it easy to find an educational Toy that both children and parents like!
"This little toy is really pretty amazing, especially for the price.
It is very thin and light, which is just perfect for this age, as most of the toys are bigger and bulky.
It's actually a touch screen, and the kids get that concept right away.
It sings and talks, of course, but what struck me most of all was that it is ""smart.
""My 2-year-old was playing with it, and it was asking her to touch a particular picture (""3 blueberries"" or similar).
Instead of touching the picture it was asking for, she kept touching another picture.
The toy caught up with her after she did this 3 or 4 times, and instead asked her to touch the picture she was already pressing over and over.
Now, it was clear she didn't understand what the toy was asking her to do, so this change in tactics may have helped her to understand.
My 5-year-old, of course, got the idea of the toy right away, and was able to do the games.
He's out of the age range of this toy, but it still kept him entertained for a few minutes.I don't think we've even found everything that this little toy can do yet.
My 2-year-old doesn't play with it for long periods of time, but I think it might make a good travel toy, because it is so light and easy to transport.
It doesn't seem flimsy, but my kids are gentle with their toys for the most part, so I can't speak to it's durability yet, especially with kids who are more physical."
For my daughter that likes trains and Old McDonald this made her light up immediately in excitement.
Since she's started trying to count, I've found this a helpful reinforcement.
Plus it also lets her pick up some new vocabulary words when counting the items pictured.Since she's just under two, I think she's going to get even more out of this toy as she ages.
However, even now she sways to the music, sings, and counts along with it.I do think this is one of those toys that can be used by a child alone or with the assistance of a parent to guide the skills they need most.
It's also light to carry so I've found it a nice item to use both at home and in the car to keep her busy.
Two year olds are easily distracted.
Indeed, they typically have no tract to be dissed from.
My two year old is typical in this respect.
She'll eat at the table, until she remembers that there may be something yummier under the table, or perhaps in the kitchen, or maybe even in the pantry.
And is this her fork?
Well, it's not the one with the flower on it and so it must be exchanged.
As for this green spoon, it really won't do with the flowery fork.
And so forth and so on.
In short, buying her a toy tends to be an exercise in futility because soon enough she is distracted by a squirrel, a dog, a cat, her sister, her brother, her other sister, etc., etc.
And then along came this Touch Magic Counting Train which anticipates her distraction with object-identifying games that have her seeking out the squirrel or the ice cream cone or what have you.
A great toy that keeps the two year old constructively distracted.
"I don't know why another reviewer had an issue with this.
I've received this from amazon and also bought another as a gift.
I also have the ""Rockin Schoolbus"" for letters from leapfrog, and they all have batteries included.
There is a little power switch in the back, and if that's not switched on, then the power button on the front won't work either.
I suspect that might have been a problem for people who believed that it didn't come with batteries.Both this toy and the Rocking Schoolbus are fantastic.
They are essentially the same toy with similar games, but this teaches numbers and the other teaches letters.
I like the Rocking Schoolbus better - the voices and songs are just more appealing to me.
Though of course if you want to learn numbers instead of letters, this is the way to go.This toy is very durable.
It's been dropped and tossed and drooled on, and holds up extremely well.
My 2 year old nephew plays with it, but my 4 month daughter loves this toy too - she doesn't know what she's doing, but she knows if she pounds on this it makes lots of noise, and she loves that.
So even though it says 2-4 on the age guideline, that might be the age that the learning is targeted at, but younger babies can also enjoy this toy, because ultimately it's a nice colorful toy that you can tap and it talks and plays music.
So I see this as a toy that she will play with from now until at some point she's old enough to realize what numbers are.
I think that's a fantastic bonus - to have a real learning toy that has appeal even before the baby is ready for the learning part."
Our granddaughter LOVES this thing.
It's very easy to turn on and to use.
The most gentle touch gets a response and it is very easy to clean with a damp rag.
Our granddaughter is 3 and a half and can count, but she's a late talker like I was.
It's very hard for us to understand her most of the time, so this toy is not only helping her with her numbers, it's also helping her with enunciation and pronunciation... so we all love it!
"I was initially excited about this toy because it's a counting train and my almost 3-year old son loves trains.
Unfortunately, the train aspect gets lost among the many other images on the toy.
He didn't really seem that interested in the train, which is surprising given how much he loves trains.
My overall impression is that this is likely a great toy for young children who are familiar with ""touch technology"" and by this I mean, the iPad, iPhone, iPod, etc.
devices where they touch the screen and something happens.
I pass no judgment on any parent who has introduced their young child to these devices and have been awed by 2-year olds who navigate their way around an iPad or iPhone, however, we have not yet introduced our little ones to computer-like devices; thus, my son really had no idea how to make this work - there were no obvious buttons.
Even figuring out how to turn it on and off wasn't obvious to him.
For us, it turned out to be yet another plastic, educational toy that really isn't all that educational given the lost interest that occurs after just a few minutes of play.
That said, I am impressed with the movement forward with respect to the technology (i.e.
touch technology) and imagine that many toys will likely soon follow suit."
This gadget is fairly cheap for an electronic teaching toy.
It's very basic, teaching counting, visual recognition of some items, and sing-along play to songs.
It's perfect for 2-3 year old kids.
I like that it has two volume selections, is very sleek and colorful, and has pleasant voices.
Our preschoolers really enjoy it, though it has a short lifespan.
I think by 4 they will have aged out of it.
Still, nice for younger preschoolers.
"The LeapFrog Touch Magic Counting Train offers a lot more education and entertainment than I had expected.
My 3-year-old enjoys counting along, singing along, and matching a number with the item that has that quantity (e.g., Hear ""2"", then touch two ice cream scoops).
It's easy to use, and responsive to a light touch.
Almost every area of the surface will interact to touch, making it more engaging and interesting.
It wouldn't seem durable, but it's been dropped and banged around, and done just fine.
Overall, it's a fun and educational toy with a lot to keep the interest of a young child."
"Typically, I think the age ranges on toys are super conservative, but in the case of this one, I think it's dead on, at least with the starting age.
My son is 11 months old and though he enjoyed running his hand along the flat surface to make the noises, he didn't really get a whole lot of other entertainment out of it.
It needed actual buttons to appeal to a slightly younger child, so they could recognize exactly what they were pushing.
He has no idea the difference between the numbers 1 and 10 and with this being flat, without designated buttons for each specific number, he wasn't really learning.That being said, my rating is not for a poor design -- my child is younger than the target age range -- but, rather for the lack of ""fun.""
It's kind of a boring toy.
It doesn't teach anything that a million other toys don't already help to teach and the animals are slightly creepy looking.
I just think, overall, you could purchase something better for the same price, but there isn't anything ""wrong"" with it."
"Leap Frog is dependable when it comes to educational toys and this one is another one that fits right at home with the rest of their offerings.
Kids can learn to count, learn new vocabulary skills and play simple games, including one that allows them to create a customized version of ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm"" when you select the specific animal icons.
There are no buttons, simply active areas to touch which greatly reduces the chances of stuck buttons and/or irreparable damage.
It's lightweight which makes it easy for your little ones to carry around as well.
Recommended!"
We are liking the LeapFrog products and this counting train is no exception.
The train is easy to use, and a good teaching tool.
It allows for individual learning by the child, or even better, fun time learning with family.
My granddaughter is 4, and already knows how to count well past 20.
Four is the upper end of the stated age range of 2-4 for this toy.
Even though she already knows the numbers and isn't really learning anything from this, she has a great time playing with it.
I guess sometimes it's nice to just play!
