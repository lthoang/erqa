Reviews:
This K'NEX Angry Birds set is fun to make and fun to knock down!
We sent this to my daughter in college (an Engineering School) to review and it was a big hit with her dorm friends.
She brought it home for us to try out and we all enjoyed it far more than adults should.This instructions were quite good but younger children will likely need adult help.Recommended!CFH
This has a ton of pieces, but my 8 year old was able to put it together, with no assistance, in about 20 minutes.
We have the Angry Bird apps and an actual Angry Bird game, so we thought this would be fun as well.
It wasn't.
Catapulting the little bird is awkward and impossible.
If you actually manage to get the bird to fly, putting the million pieces back together again is time consuming and frustrating.
My daughter had the most fun assembling it immediately out of the box.
It is now sitting on a shelf because no one is really interested in playing with it.
Some games start out as physical games and turn into computer games that don't really work.
This is the opposite situation.
The idea is noble - most kids need less screen time.
The execution is impeccable.
I can't believe how well designed everything is.
The bird launching sling shot deserves and engineering award.
No detail was left unattended to, and the details of the birds and components are artwork.However, because it's meant to be knocked down, it's also obnoxious to set up.
Think bowling.
You're the one setting up the bowling pins while your kids knock them down.
Over and over.
I can't imagine very many children would have the patience to set this up and knock it down for any length of time - I know mine didn't.So it sits unloved in the cabinet.
I'm sure they'll play with it again and they absolutely loved it while I was sitting there setting it up for them.
When I left, the fun ended.
This could work for some children but I think most kids would quickly tire of setting it up.
Since this set works with all other Knex, the possibilities are endless.
The Angry birds are cute and work well with the other parts - packaging was a bit of an overkill with everything being in an individual bag, but that's the only negative thing about this set.
Clear instructions helped my 6 yr old play right away and he has gone back to it over and over.
"Ok yes my son loves Angry birds.
He flipped (good) when he saw the box, then I flipped (bad) when I saw all 170 pieces.
If you have patient children and they love angry birds, then this is for your kids.
But both me and my son do not the have patience to play with this.
We have the smaller angry bird sets that you have to set up and knock down, ok for about 15 minutes of ""fun"" but this super-sized set is over the top, makes you appreciate the game as an app and should stay as an app."
"I know the idea of this set is that you build it and then shoot birds at it to knock it over, however, the K'nex don't stick together long enough to actually assemble the thing.
By the time you finally (with a lot of effort to not swear violently) get the whole thing assembled, you and your child will have built each segment at least three times and reattached each pig at least six times (and each time you place a pig, you'll break at least one part of your planet structure.)
By the time you fire the two birds (after you figure out just how hard you have to squeeze to get the birds to fly - hint: harder than you imagine you need to) you'll likely hear your child say, ""well, at least the pigs and birds are fun."""
Though we know the toy is meant to be knocked down, the fact that it's very hard to set up makes for a frustrating time!
Nevertheless, the kids still think it rates 4 stars in the fun department.
Just be prepared to have a few unexpected crashes during construction.
This is a little like Legos in that it's a building toy, but it has other parts that move.
It also has well branded characters that add another layer of fun.
The catapult creates a target practice type of game that has gone on forever.
Watch out that your kids don't start targeting all kinds of things though.
You will have building blocks and Angry Birds everywhere.
I's fun.
It requires a bit of imagination to play with it.
I think that's a must.
I don't like toys that do everything for you, you know?
