this newspaper is in English or you can change the language to Spanish?.
Do you have to write with the invisible pen and use the black light only to read and write in the diary?
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen?

Okay, it's a novelty item, but a delightful item for young girls.
For a secret diary, anyone nearby will know that the owner of the diary is about to open the diary because a password has to be spoken audibly, but the whole thing has a magical appeal of &#34;open sesame.&#34; I recommend a short, clear password.
It's not like Dragon speech software is processing the audio.It's pretty hefty for a diary, 8 1/4&#34; by 6 1/4&#34;.
I don't know what else to say about it except that I wish the pen and the pad can be replaced.
Also, don't forget to get three AA batteries.
It's a fabulous gift for a young elementary school-aged girl.
My daughter enjoys having a locking journal with a password.
She loves recording her own alarms for when people try to break in, including an ear-splitting shrieking alarm.
Unfortunately, she often can't get herself into the journal so we have to hear the alarm over and over.
We made her get rid of the shrieking monkey alarm.The voice-password has to have just the right intonation and accent as was initially used in the recording.
The good news is that it really does recognize her voice.
The bad news is that sometimes she says it wrong, forgets the words to a complicated pass-phrase, is too loud, too quiet, or just puts the accent in the wrong place ... and can't get in.Fortunately, you can re-set the whole thing and start over.
We've had to do that a few times.
Sometimes she just has to say it several times until she gets it just right, but we have over-ridden the password in the past.The invisible ink and black-light work well inside, and she enjoys that.
She keeps a log of any attempted break-ins, and feels very important writing in her journal.
She was writing in it several times a day at first, but she seems to be losing interest.
She's much less faithful about writing in it now.
My seven-year old daughter loves this journal.
It is password protected, but you chose the password yourself.
You actually record yourself saying a word or phrase and it's saved as the password.
There are multiple settings so it can be easier to open for the younger children.
It also lets you record a message for when someone tries to open your journal and can't get in.
My daughter made her message say, &#34;Step away from the journal&#34;.
You also record a message for when you have successfully opened it, like &#34;Welcome back, Ghoulfriend&#34;.
There were a few times when she couldn't get the journal to open and we had to reset the password, but fortunately, it's easy to do.
Once you have opened the journal, there is a light inside that lets you read what you've wrote with your enclosed secret ink pen.
It's cute, fun and innocent.
Mattel has a genuine hit on its hands with the Monster High Dolls.
Anything new sells out almost instantly, but generally enough are produced so that even if you don't get it at release time, you can get it sometime later without paying a premium.
Anyone remember chasing after Beanie Babies for ungodly prices?
Or, Cabbage Patch Dolls many years ago?
Mattel has done a great job with this line of dolls.The password journal is a key piece to the collection in the sense that it helps bring the dolls to life for our young lady.
You need to speak a password to open it, need  a 2nd password to open a hidden compartment and has invisible ink plus other things.
Our boy now will actually sit and play with her (for a very few moments until he realizes he's playing a girl's game).
He does because he is into all the Secret Spy toys, and this sort of fits in.Mostly it is her who shares secrets with her dolls, jots down what they tell her in the notebook and in the journal.
I am pleased to have found this on Vine, I overlooked it at the Mattel and Amazon sites if it was available there.
My little cuz loves this product right here.
she has a few other of these password journals.
Some have worked others haven't.
This one works just fine and she has loved having it, especially since it is a Monster High.
There is a second part in the journal that requires to unlocked as well.
Then of course you can record alerts and things like that in case some tries to get into it.
"As long as there have been diaries and brothers, girls have had the problem of keeping the latter out of the former.
Back when diaries were carved on stone tablets, you could rig a trap so that the stone tablets would just fall on the creep, but depending on the level of injuries sustained, you might hear about it later from your parents.
Diaries recorded on scrolls or in books could be tied shut with various intricate knots, but usually untied if brothers had enough time.
Mechanical locks were a great improvement,.. depending how easy they were for brothers to pick.
But now in the age of computers we have the spoken password lock diary!Note: It is recommended that you start with the security set to Low.
If your child is older and can enunciate clearly enough (and her brother is stubborn enough to keep trying), she can try it on High, but this will likely result in more failed attempts to open it herself.
Shorter passwords tend to work better.
If someone has tried but failed to give the right password after three attempts since the last successful opening, you will hear the message ""New Intruders"" following a successful opening, but if you mess up the password yourself in three attempts, you will obliterate the evidence of any such previous attempt.The item comes with 4 x 6 inch 25 unlined page spiral notebook, which can be replaced with one of similar size when used up.
The secret compartment behind the diary is pretty small: 3 13/16 x 2 15/16 x 5/16 inches, but the cover lifts off for complete access.
The invisible ink pen included works on ordinary paper.In sum this is a functional girl's diary also available inPink Password Journal 8andTeal Password Journal 8for the non-Monster-High fan.
In contrast theEver After High Secret Hearts Password Journalhas a noticeably different design.
There is also available this somewhat similarMonster High Password Journal, which features a second password for the secret compartment."
Have a Monster High fan in your household that likes to write?
This is a fun item to look into!
It's an electric diary that opens when you speak the proper password.
Another fun feature?
It allows you to write in invisible ink and see it under a special fold out light.
I like the idea behind this journal and think that, for some, the novelty of speaking your password might actually make them more inclined to keep on writing.
Besides just setting your password, you can save a personalized greeting, too.This takes batteries, so you probably want to have those on hand if you're gifting this to someone.
The actual diary is put together well enough.
It's plastic pieces seem fine to me.
I'm not sure this could take a fall from a high distance, but for general everyday use, it's as expected.
The actual password function works much better than expected!
We've had no trouble getting this to recognize the password!I wasn't sure how this was going to fare when first ordering it.
Some 'secret' journals just don't work well.
This one, though, seems to work rather well and partnered with the fantastic Monster High line?
It's a winner!
You have to say the password to see how rad the journal is.
Diary has come a long way from the times of Samuel Pepys.
It feels as sci-fi as the cars with doors that open upwards like wings.
The invisible ink is cool too.
Only you have to keep moving the journal close to the light, to read what you have written.
It would have been better if we could adjust the light to fall on the book.
This is a great little lockup journal/case.
Has an hidden invisible ink pen, which should your voice activated password lock become compromised............ your secret writings will be kept from being compromised by your invisible writing.
Do be careful though, brothers can be driven crazy by the thought of cracking this baby open.
They often try to mimic your voice and guess what your password is.
Alas, if the &#34;brother&#34; has heard you speak your password, and the inflection of how you say it as your password, he just may gain access to your writings........... so, do not open your journal in his presence, and definitely don't tell him about the invisible ink, so that if he cracks the lock, all he'll find is blank paper inside!
So be sure to keep it all a secret!
My daughter has been asking me for one of these things for at least a year, so when this came available, I snatched it right up.
She loves all things Monster High and thought it would be cool to password protect her secrets.
Overall, she has enjoyed it.
There are two reasons it's not getting a higher rating.
The first is that we've had some problems getting it to recognize the password.
My husband has reset it for her several times.
The second is that it doesn't come with much paper.
My daughter went through that little notebook in no time at all!
I do plan to look for paper refills that will fit.
This journal is just Okay, it has its pros and conspros - Kids enjoy it, invisible ink and light, secret hidding spot, looks good, gotcha prompt,cons - There are a lot of prompts to record, getting in isn't entirely fool proof.We have gone through a few of these in our house, this one is Okay, there have been a few that I would say are very poorly made and the voice doesn't work.
This one, it works most of the time, in my house, a few times my son was able to unlock it on my daughter using the same word as the password and once using a different word.
I think they have similiar voices (son hasn't hit puberty yet) and that might be the issue.
for the most part, it has been fun for the kids.
When I first showed this to my daughter she fell in love with it.
She loves anything Monster High and as an 8 year old  she loves to write and keep any kind of journal.
The only downside we have experienced with this is the voice password.
She is having a hard time getting the journal to recognize passwords she is setting which frustrates her and detracts from the appeal of this journal.
I am not a fan of Monster High, but my eight-year-old granddaughter is totally taken with this line of merchandise.
I AM a fan of things that will get children to practice their literacy skills.
This journal has enough bells and whistles to encourage kids to sit down and write.
With its security features, it's so much better than the diary I had as a young girl that my brother and his friend not only broke into, but added their own comments.
I would have loved having the technology incorporated in this diary--invisible ink and a voice activated lock, along with a secret compartment--and a super soaker wouldn't have been bad either!
I actually like this Journal a lot, and if I had secrets, I would be using it.
Since I don't, I'm allowing my granddaughter to &#34;borrow&#34; it so she has somewhere to document how much she hates Justin Bieber (oh, how the mighty have fallen!
).
My niece absolutely love the password Journal!
Have you been a fan of the dolla for many years she was very surprised to receive this item for her birthday and still uses it today.
This is the second MH password journal released and it's just as cool as the first.I love the new design and all the cool features.
In order for it to be unlocked it has a voice passcode recognition and it opens up to a notebook, which in my opinion  is kind of small so the pages may fill up quickly.
Included is a black light and another passcode compartment in the back of the journal.
This is a great addition for any little girl who loves Monster High!
My teenager says this is &#34;ok&#34;.
She finds it hard to get knot and says it does not hold much inside.
She does like the bright Monster High coloring and logo.
I feel it is overpriced for what it is.
My niece is 10 and she absolutely loves this journal.
It's perfect for a techy kid, who still likes the idea of journaling.
She really loves all the secret compartments and the fact that her younger siblings can't get into it.
My eight year old granddaughter loves this journal.
She has a blast making up passwords and then watching her seven year old try to imitate her voice to break into the journal.
She hides sticks of gum and other little treasures in the tiny secret drawer.
The pad of paper with the invisible ink makes them both happy, but the paper runs out quickly.
You can replace it with little notebooks of similar size.
If the password doesn't work, you can insert a pin, pen or toothpick into the reset hole on the front of the journal to reset it.
This journal is a little bite heavier and sturdier that some of the other toy books I have bought for the kids.
You will need three AA batteries that are not supplied in the box.
It is very hard to get out of the box.
I don't know why such cheap toys have to be packaged like Fort Knox.
