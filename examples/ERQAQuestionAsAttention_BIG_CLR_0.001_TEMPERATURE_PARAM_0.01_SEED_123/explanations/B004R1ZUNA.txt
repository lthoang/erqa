Reviews:
"I cannot believe how large this toy is!
The picture really doesn't do it justice.
My almost 2 year old loves this toy.
I kinda almost feel sorry for the animals when he plays with them though.
They get dumped off the tilting leaf thing constantly.
And he laughs every time!The handle on the top was a really cool find.
I saw it in the picture, but I'd forgotten about it.
My 5 year old can carry it around and help his brother play with it!I wish it came with more animals, but they are available, so I'll be picking those up whenever I see them!
It's also neat that they can be stored inside the cave, but ours really end up in the Little People box in the storage bin anyway.As with any toy in the store, it took a little more than a few minutes to get it out of the box, but really, it didn't matter.
It took a few minutes to put it together and they were hopping next to the table wanting to play with it!
I was able to get it out and ready for play fairly quickly and it seems to be holding up well from constant play.I do worry about the animal swing, but only because my son is a little rough with it.Almost two months later: They're still playing with this almost daily and I've been able to find more ""talking"" animals for Christmas presents!
I love this!
And the swing is holding up just fine."
When we were looking at things to get our daughter for Christmas, this was at the top of the list.
She really loves it and wants to get it out first thing every morning, but we are a little disappointed with it still.
One of the things we thought would be really cool was that you can purchase extra animals with it.
It comes with a polar bear, lion, gorilla, and zoo keeper, bu you can buy all sorts of other animals for it according to Fisher Price's website.
MSRP on these extra animals is about $3.99.
Here is the problem, you cannot find these ANYWHERE for that price.
On Amazon they are triple that, walmart and target don't actually sell them, and you can find them listed sometimes on eBay, but they are about the same price as Amazon.
I don't understand paying for this toy and then paying twice that to fill it with animals.
I've come to expect more from Fisher Price.
While my daughter loves this toy, I think for the value, the A-Z Learning Zoo [[ASIN:B00106CGP0 Fisher Price Little People A to Z Learning Zoo Playset] comes with more animals, and you will spend less overall for your child having more animals to play with.
This set is first off much bigger than I expected from the box, but then not too big its obnoxious.
It is about two feet by two feet and has a nice carrying handle to take it room to room or easily turn it around to play with it on the flip side.
Once I opened the box I was worried it was going to be a project to put together but it pretty much all snaps together except for three screws.
I had it together in about ten minutes, and I did have to install three batteries, which were not included.The Little People Zoo Talkers Animal Sounds Zoo is for ages 1  to 5 years old, and my 3 and 4-year-old sons love it.
There is so much to do, both front and back that my boys didn't feel crowded with both of them playing.
The set makes so many different noises, not including the music or speech about the animals.
There are squeaks, twist noises, clicks and more.
My boys are just so excited each time they play with it to make as much noise as they can!
There is a slide, swing, twisting leaf, peek-a-boo door and little spots to put the animals.The only thing I was disappointed with was that the set only comes with three animals and a zookeeper.
It is enough for two-three kids to play with but I would like to have more animals.
Luckily, there is a total of nine other animals you can purchase to play with in the set that I am sure I will be adding to ours.Overall, the playset is very colorful, bright and is a great size.
I was impressed with all the sounds and interactions you can make and my boys love it.
They played with it for a good hour right when we set it up and then played with it again a few more times throughout the day and since then.
They even found other random animals and figurines to play with and even put their cars on the waterslide!
As far as educational aspects go, I like that my boys can see how the different animals live (North and South Poles, Jungle, and Water regions.
I would recommend this playset for any child and it will definitely grow with your child as it is fun for all ages!
My kids love this play set, but perhaps not for the reason that we expected.
We thought the noisy-animal aspect of the toy would be what they enjoyed most.
Actually, they don't even bother with that.
Our kids have many Fisher-Price animals, but only special ones make the noises.
Those special ones were so expensive that we didn't get any extra ones to go with the play set.
So, more than half their animals didn't do the squawking thing anyway.
Then the battery wore out, and we never got around to replacing it.
The kids kept playing with the toy just as much.Not only do they not care if the toy makes noise, they don't even care if it's a zoo.
Sometimes the kids play with it with cars, sometimes action figures, and only sometimes Fisher-Price zoo animals.
With a little imagination, this zoo has the potential to be almost anything.
My kids, 6 and 4, have gotten hours of playtime out of this toy.
It's become one of the more popular toys in the house.
Little People toys are always fine quality, and this one is no exception.
We have 3 kids under the age of 3, and they are not all that interested in this toy anymore.
In fact, they never really were that interested.
I would ask they why not, except infants and toddlers are not known for articulating their preferences very well, except by smiling, laughing, frowning, or crying.
This toy elicits none of the aforementioned responses--just a straight face, a blank stare, or a passing glance.
Perhaps it has something to do with the million other toys strewn around the house.
Think about it.
If you were wading through toys all day long, you might not get too attached to any particular toy either.
Then again, you are a grown adult, and you should be spending your time on more productive things than wading through toys.
All of this said, there are toys that tend to get more attention on a frequent basis around the house.
Think BIGGER TOYS with FEWER PIECES.
Those are the ones that don't get lost in the heap like this one.
Gotta go!
Diapers to change!
"My grandson loves his Fisher-Price Little People A to Z Learning Zoo Playset.
That set comes with 26 animals and, in addition to ""saying"" the animal's name and making its sound, that toy gives the letter with which a particular animal's name begins.
Naturally, when I saw this Little People Zoo Talkers Animal Sounds Zoo, I immediately thought of his coming birthday and how much he would enjoy this toy.Like other Fisher-Price products, the Zoo Talkers Animal Sounds Zoo is colorful and well-made.
The plastic seams are smooth and pose little chance that a child will be scratched or cut themselves while playing.
The animals are cute depictions of the real thing.
The jungle environment/scene provides numerous opportunities for imaginative play; I particularly liked this feature.
On the downside, the fact that the animals only make sounds adds little to the educational value of this product.
Additionally, since little ones are likely to become enamoured of the one animal sound you find most annoying, you may live to regret your purchase!I found the cost to purchase the add-ons which would ""complete"" this toy offputting.
If one goes to the Fisher-Price website, the 8 figures and the three figure/book combinations offered total $43.99, including shipping.
Tax is also charged.
The Safari Truck, which Amazon offers, is more expensive at the Fisher-Price site since they charge shipping and tax.This may appeal to the lower end of and to less mature children at the upper end of the recommended age range.
However, I felt it had less educational value than the Learning Zoo and was less appealing overall.
Further, the additional monies to ""complete"" the set and not something I feel is welcomed by parents and grandparents.
It is for these reasons that I gave this product only four stars."
This comes with the Zoo Talks Animal Sounds Zoo, plus three animals (polar bear, gorilla, and a lion).
These animals can be put on a little pedestal (which is easy enough for my 18 month old to do) and when pushed down their name will be said out loud, press it again and the animal sound comes out.
There are a couple of other buttons to push that will cycle through different noises/songs for the zoo.The Zoo itself has multiple different fun activities for a child.
My daughter's current favorites are the slide (loves dropping the animals off and watching them slide down), and the swing.
We purchased a few additional Zoo Talkers animals (and the sounds work with this set), and she loves putting them around the toy.
There is also a teeter-totter, various shelves, and lots of other things to keep your kids involved.
This is played with almost every day.
I was so excited to get this for my daughter for Christmas.
We have so many great little people toys: the barn, house, bus, plane, nativity set, playground set, and we like them all.
We got the barn for Christmas for our son (who was 1 then) three years ago and both kids love it.
I thought this would have similar appeal, the animals could use the swing and slide, but neither kid has touched it AT ALL.
This thing is huge, twice the size of the barn, and I have tried it in two places with no luck.
My biggest complaint is the incompatibility with other little people animals.
YES of course I knew other animals wouldn't be able to activate the sounds but I assumed they could at least all hang out together.
The zoo animals are a totally different size and shape from all the other sets, they just don't seem to go together.
If you're shopping for a Little People toy for an animal loving kid consider the barn.Fisher-Price Little People Animal Sounds FarmMy son and daughter have played with it every day for years, it's excellent.
I wouldn't reccommend this zoo to anyone, I'm ticked I have to pack up a brand new toy with it's lame chunky animals and try to find a friend who will find room for it in their house._____________________________________________________________________________________________Well, it's May now and I don't hate this toy quite so much any more.
I never got around to giving it away and my 2 year old does play with it sometimes while I'm in the shower.
While I do now plan to keep it in my bedroom to entertain her while I shower in the mornings, it's still my least favorite of the otherwise excellent Little People toys we own.
"I gave this to my 27 month old today b/c I couldn't wait until Christmas (bad mommy!).
So far we both love it.
I am AWFUL at assembling things - but this honestly was easy to put together.
It took me less than 15 minutes so the average person would be able to do it in 5 minutes.
:).
There are so many activities that the animals can do on this set that I don't think you need to go crazy and buy a ton of the zoo talker animals; my baby is having a ball with the 3 that it comes with and her ""my little ponies"" and other little animals we already own have been integrated nicely with the real zoo talkers.
We did buy a few of the others on the FP website for two fifty each w/ promo code - but I'm hiding them for now and almost wish I didn't buy them b/c the set really is a ton of fun even without that element.
There are a few songs for each habitat and little sound clips like ""the animals are all sleepy.
Let's tuck them in"" or ""time to feed the animals"" - which my baby ignores.
The slide is her favorite part - and she loves the peekaboo area too.
We bought this on ebay for under thirty bucks used and I think it was worth that price.
I've seen the price fluctuate a lot here on amazon.
I recommend both this and the learning zoo equally (got that on ebay too).
This is more fun in terms of physical play, and the learning zoo is more fun in terms of having a ton of animals to to interact with and a ton of sounds (and those animals can be used in the tub)."
"I was pretty surprised in terms of the level of entertainment and playability that this toy provides.
While it seems pretty simplistic, my daughter (24 months) was fascinated by all the moving pieces and sounds that the toy made.
She was able to figure out how to use the sound platform with the different animals within 5 minutes of my putting batteries in the toy.
The zoo was easy for me to assemble (although I don't like the screws that hold it together, just because they were somewhat hard to get in).
It's pretty rugged and deals with getting pushed around the room quite well.
My 8 month old likes the animals and they're soft enough to prevent any injuries from falls, drops or throws.They toy is well-built and extremely functional.
The slide works well with all the animals (my 24 month old absolutely loves that).
The doors, buttons, knobs, and other features are all easy enough to manipulate so that they actually work for small children (a problem I've run into with several other toys).The sounds are somewhat annoying and it doesn't really add much to the toy.
The zoo is somewhat large making it bulky to store.
Overall it's a good toy that has appeal to a pretty broad age range.
I was pleased with the fact that you can buy ""expansion animals"" which helps to extend its entertainment value.
This toy reminded me of the ""Little People""  sets I had when I was a kid and I think that Fisher Price has done an excellent job of continuing that tradition."
"I edited this review after watching my GF's grandchild play with it over a period of a few weeks.
Changed the review from 4 to 5 stars.
The kid loves this toy.We were done assembling this toy and both asked ""are there missing pieces?!""
No - it's designed this way.
The snaps and connectors are not covered, and since they look almost identical to the places where the characters ""connect"", this is confusing.
There should be caps to give these areas a more finished look.
The slide snaps together with a 1/8"" gap.
Again, looks unfinished.
ONE screw is used to connect the tree to the ""rocks"".
The entire thing twists and feels very cheap.
I thought ""No way it's going to hold up to any abuse or rough play.""
I was wrong.
The volume is OK - not that loud (and the 3AA batteries are not included.)
You get two sounds per animal - the name and the sound it makes.There's a ""pond"" with a hippo and water lily.
Both make noise as well (about 50% louder than the rest.)
Pushing the lily opens the hippo's mouth.
It's Fisher-Price so I knew it would be sturdy, what I didn't realize was how much my 3 year old would love it.
His imagination comes into play as he makes the animal talk to each other, listen to the animal sounds and has the animals swing, slide or just play.
It is light weight and easy to move around from room to room.
