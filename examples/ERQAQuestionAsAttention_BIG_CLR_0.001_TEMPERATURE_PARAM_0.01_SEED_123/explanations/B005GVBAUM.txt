There are fairly limited numbers of pieces included - pretty much exactly what you need to create exactly what's shown on the box.
The first time playing with this, we even had a piece break on us while trying to build.We have the Lauri Tall Stacker Pegs Building Set and really like it.
The activity guide contains good ideas for adding to the educational aspect of the fun.
It reminds me of the mousetrap game, which I liked immensely as a kid.
When I got this out for my kids (age 4 and 6; the recommended age is 3+) they were very excited to dive in.

Reviews:
"We had a blast with this set.
My almost 3 year old needed minimal directions to start building.
Of course, we started with ""how high can we stack these"" and moved into ""can we stack all one color together"" and then into ""let's build with them!""
I sat with him the whole time and had to help a bit with the building.
My 6 year old had absolutely no problem with it once I showed how to do it.I like that these are compatible with other stacking or monkey toys in the product line.
I could see this becoming something we have lots of and build really big things.
I'd love to have a bunch of them and make a longer slide or something that's a little more involved and can hold attention longer.The only negative is that the monkeys themselves are a little small (for this age group to play with safely) and there's only two of them in the set.
I like that there are play suggestions included, but we just made up our own towers, etc anyway after the first time we put the whole thing together.I don't think I'd allow my almost 3 year old to play with it by himself though.
That's the only reason a star is taken off the rating."
I got this item for my 2 year old son.
What amused me is that my 12, 9, and 4 year old children thought it looked like fun, too.
The box comes with all the items needed to build a monkey playground.
The plastic pieces will last well unless an adult or large child steps on them -- so the quality is about what I expected.
The pieces are colorful and the right size for toddler's hands.
My 2 year old has no trouble stacking them, but he plays regularly with small legos.
The activity guide contains good ideas for adding to the educational aspect of the fun.
There are suggestions for teaching color recognition and discrimination, patterning, and some early math skills.
This could be a fun addition to a preschool or a home's collection of games for toddlers and young preschoolers.
Don't be surprised if older kids grab it, too.
We are big fans of Lauri products in our house so we were excited to try out this MIghty Monkey Playset.
Unfortunately this is the first Lauri product that we are not big fans of.
The idea is cute but the execution of building the playground for the monkeys was challenging, even for us adults.
The first time playing with this, we even had a piece break on us while trying to build.We have the Lauri Tall Stacker Pegs Building Set and really like it.
If you are looking for a versatile toy that can teach patterns, counting, increase fine motor skills, I would recommend that product instead of this one.
"I gave this to our 4 year-old to test, and had some interesting results.
Unlike plain old wooden blocks or bristle blocks, she didn't jump to just throwing stuff together and making things herself.
Instead, we both worked to build something that looked almost like the set-up on the cover of the box.
Once we got it set up together, she had fun playing with it, but I could tell that it wasn't quite the same kind of creative interaction as with less specific (if that makes sense) building blocks.I don't think it's reasonable to expect a 4 year-old to be able to be truly self-sufficient with this toy.
First of all, executing the slide correctly requires quite a bit of looking at the box and applying what you see there to the project.
I'm not going to lie.
This kind of taxed me at first.
Second, to get the pegs to stack correctly requires a combination of hand strength and fine motor skills that I don't think most kids in this age have.
When an adult struggles to get things to line up correctly, you know that a kid is going to get frustrated really easily.Third point...here's where I go off on a tangent that will make no sense to people who haven't played Starcraft.
You know how you need to build new Zerg structures on ""the creep?""
Well, since the pegs slot into the mat at their bottom, with this toy you're pretty much restricted to building on the creep.
It wouldn't be so bad, but it's a pretty small square of rubbery stuff, and everything seems kind of crowded together.I guess this is somewhat true to life since jungles and other natural monkey habitats aren't known for their spacious accommodations, but I think the whole ""monkeys sliding down a slide in a cart"" part of the toy blows any claim at verisimilitude.That's not to say it's a bad toy--once it was set up, we both had fun playing with it, and I just got an unsolicited, ""It's really fun"" endorsement.
But it's not something like a bag of blocks, where your little one is going to be putting things together herself from the start."
"Not only will fans of H. A. and Margaret Rey's ""Curious George"" love Lauri's ""Tall-Stacker Mighty Monkey Playset,"" but so will any child who enjoys creative building toys.This toy gives a child free-rein to build, using the pieces provided, whatever they can imagine.
Components that allow and encourage action and movement, e.g.
the wagon, the slide, and the swings, further engage children who may become bored with simply creating a static model.
The four ""mighty monkey"" pillars are a humorous touch; the two smaller monkeys resemble ""Curious George"" and will captivate his fans.The pegs and ""mighty monkeys"" are made of hard plastic.
Parents might want to check the pegs as the ""Tall-Stacker Mighty Monkey Playset"" we received had rough protrusions on many of the pegs where the peg had been removed from the mold.
A child's skin might be scratched by these rough protrusions; this was easily remedied using a fine file from my spouse's tool box.The peg board base and the treetops are made of foam; the base portion is fairly sturdy and should not tear.
The treetops are more lightweight and might possibly be torn.
The slide's sections are made of a translucent, flexible plastic and appear to be quite sturdy.
Households where there is younger child or those having a child who puts everything in their mouth might want to remove the coconuts.
They are small enough to become lodged in a child's throat.If you are looking for a colorful, sturdy building toy which allows a child to combine imagination and creativity, you should consider Lauri's ""Tall-Stacker Mighty Monkey Playset.""
It appears to be a toy that will engage a child for a long period of time and will maintain their interest for more than one play session.
Each time Lauri's ""Tall-Stacker Mighty Monkey Playset"" is used provides a new and different building experience."
From the box and the description, this toy looks like it could be a lot of fun.
There are a variety of pegs, trees, a slide, a swing and other assorted pieces that are supposed to assemble to form a playground for the little monkey.
When I got this out for my kids (age 4 and 6; the recommended age is 3+) they were very excited to dive in.
Within 10 minutes, however, they were complaining that it was too hard.
I noticed that they had simply inserted all the pegs into the board in rows and all the other pieces were lying scattered about.
I was thinking it was a failure of creativity on their part, so I was all set to show them how it was done.
Except that I couldn't do it either.I had a great deal of difficulty getting the pieces to fit into each other, even using my adult strength.
I have no idea how kids are suppsed to do that.
Even once I got some pieces together, they didn't stay together very well.
For instance, I managed to get the swing together, but the first time they used it, it just toppled over.
I never did get the slide assembled.
I suppose over time and with a good deal of use, the pieces will loosen up and fit together better, but it's too frustrating (for the kids and me) to play with it enough to get to that point.Even if and when you get the pieces to stay together, the seeming creativity is rather deceptive too.
There are fairly limited numbers of pieces included - pretty much exactly what you need to create exactly what's shown on the box.
Because of the length and angle of the slide, there's only so many ways it can go in.
And from there, there's only so many ways the other pieces can go in around it.
There are some variations, but just minor ones on a theme.
If your kids like building toys like legos they will love this one, and if they like curious George will love it more, the monkeys are nice and the colors of this toy are pretty, is well made and the kids have lots of fun.
This kit aspires to be a playground of creativity but unlike things like Legos, Tinkertoys, etc this set is too limiting.
You really only have a couple options for putting it together so you run out of ideas pretty quickly.
The slide is cool but it basically only goes together two or three ways.
It's not all bad, but this toy set doesn't deliver on it's goals.
My kids (3 and 5) have loved playing with this kit.
They've been building trees, swinging monkeys from the vine, pulling up baskets and pushing the monkeys down the slide in the cart.
They need a little help to build a strong structure, but for the most part they can put the pieces together and direct where things should go.
Once the play set is built they play with it a lot longer than I thought they would, considering there are no branded characters, no basis in books or TV shows, just pure fun imagination.
The only thing that I wish as different was that they put dovetails in the play mat so you could connect more mats together, either included or sold separately.
As it is, the mat isn't big enough to hold the start and the end of the slide on it.
Overall I'd give it 4 and 1/2 stars if I could, it really is fun for them and easy to put away in it's box... it would've been a home run if they just made the mat expandable.
This toy was given to an almost-four year old, and he was entranced.
He loved putting the parts together and came up with some very creative ways to do so.
I thought it was a bit difficult to get the toy to look exactly like the picture on the box, but that did not matter in the least to Brandon.
He played with it for quite a long time.
I like the fact that the child can be creative with this toy.
The little ones were enjoying playing with this toy when my husband decided he would join in.
He had as much fun as they did!
I must say, though, that I don't think it is appropriate for a 3 year-old and a 4-year old might have trouble with it, too.
There are small parts, as other reviewers have noted, and it would be tough for a 3-year-old to put some of the pieces together.
They might get frustrated.Overall, it's a colorful, fun toy.
It is plastic, however, and plastic can crack and break eventually.
But that's not different from most other toys.
"Lego fans need to try the Tall Stacker Monkey Playset!
It comes with 32 tall stack pegs, 4 Mighty Monkey Pegs, 2 Monkeys, 2 Coconut trees, a slide, a wheeled cart, a tree house, a tree house, a basket ""elevator"" and a peg board to build a monkey playground on.
If your child loves Legos or building toys, this is a little different and a lot of fun.
There are a lot of different ways to build the monkeys their playground and it's so cute to have the monkeys to play on the playground when they are done.
There is an idea sheet included to give you some ideas to get started, once they get the hang of it though one of the best things is what they come up with themselves.
I do think the recommended age is a little young.
The pieces don't go together easily enough and that can cause frustration.
Also there are a lot of little pieces that really don't make it great for a three year old.
I would say ideally this is best for little builders that are almost five to about eight.
Other than that though, fun toy at a pretty good price."
This Mighty Monkey Tall Stacker Playset is really a unique toy.
If a child likes to build things then they will especially like this playset.
After they build the playset, which can be built in a different way every time they use it, they can roll little monkeys down a slide in a wagon, have the monkeys swing by their tail off a rope, or go up on a wheel barrel basket.
It comes with two monkeys, a four piece slide, thirty two pegs, trees and coconuts, s tree house, and elevator basket, a wheel cart, a swinging rope, a pegboard, and an activity guide.
This toy is the perfect combination of simple building and using your imagination to play and pretend.
It is great for young children ages three and up, particularly boys who love building and monkeys!
It can be used by more than one child at a time but can also entertain a single child.
I got this for my little boy who just turned four.
This is a great toy; he's pretty engaged when I bring it out.
It's a building toy but it's more.
For example with Duplo blocks my son would make something but once he's done, he'll take it apart and put it away.
The fun is in the making.
With this toy, the fun is in the making but once it is done, he plays with it and uses his imagination to move the little monkeys around.
They can swing, slide, hang out in the little tree house, go up and down the elevator, he's done so many things with them.Some other pros: The toy is bright and colorful.
It's well made, open ended with different configurations possible.The only downside I encountered was my son had difficulty putting some of the pieces together.
Often, you have to really push them together and he doesn't have the hand strength for it, but I'm thinking with repeated use, his hands will get stronger or the pieces will wear down and fit better.Still, the toy has a lot to offer with lots of replay value.
This was a hit with the kids one afternoon during a play date.
My daughter who is not quite 3 liked it but was a bit frustrated trying to get it set up.
The 4.5 year old LOVED it and helped my daughter play.
It is very cute and compatible with the other peg toys my daughter had, so they had a lot of pegs to choose from.
It is nice that it is good for girls and boys too.
This toy is interesting and colorful.
It does not have much in the way of innovation on the stacking games that are already on the market.
It reminds me of the mousetrap game, which I liked immensely as a kid.
But the number and types of structures one can build with this is too limited to sustain long interest.
Overall, nice idea, good colors, durable.
Not fantastic.
I've never seen anything quite like this - it's unique.
My three-year old loves to try to put it together, but it has many small parts, so he definitely needs some help.
As long as there's an adult close by to supervise and coach, this is a huge hit with my boys, ages 3 and 1 1/2.
They both love monkeys and they love being able to send the tiny monkeys down the slide and swing them in a swing.A minor complain is that the monkeys don't neatly fit into the cart that they use to go down the slide.
Another complaint is that many of the parts are small, so it's definitely important to closely supervise any little one who might put the parts in his/her mouth.The size of the parts also makes it a little challenging for small hands with developing fine motor skills to manipulate; however, I look at this to mean that this is a toy that my boys will continue to grow into for the next few years.Unfortunately, the toy isn't particularly durable - one of the tiny monkeys fell apart into many pieces.
This was with normal play, too - no rough housing.
Given that it has so many small parts, it would be great if it came with some sort of storage container that kept the parts in one place.
When my product arrived, the tiny pieces were all contained within a box that was sealed with just one piece of tape.Overall, I think this toy encourages creativitiy and imagination, and could be improved with better storage and sturdier monkeys.
Overall I have to say this is a nice little playset...  though I have to agree with some other reviewers that it probably should have been ages 5+ rather than the 3+.
There are just too many small  parts that a 3 or 4 year old could probably swallow and I'm thinking that durability would be a pretty big issue at that age as well.
That given if your child is pretty good about not putting things in their mouth and doesn't tend to be rough on their toys, I'd be fairly confident that they will enjoy this playset.
If you buy it I hope your child enjoys it and thanks for taking the time to read my review.
That's my thought on this product.
My four year old enjoyed, but he had trouble setting it up by himself.
The pieces go into a soft foam board, and as you might have guessed it isn't very stable, that frustrated our four year old son.
And while I wouldn't call the pieces flimsy, they aren't made of the most durable plastic.On the other hand, our 8 year old son was bored very quickly with this set.
He loves legos, so putting together a little playground for his younger brother amused him for all of five minutes, it's just not something I can see older kids playing with.This is our first Lauri product, and I do think it is a fairly well made product.
However for the price I would much rather buy a tub of Legos for my boys.The pieces you get with this set make set up rather limited, especially if you want to use the slide, and what kid wouldn't want to set up a slide?!
And I am not sure if it was just our set, but no matter how we set the slide up it was never flush with the treehouse platform or the ground.It's hard to recommend this product as there is nothing fundamentally wrong with it, it simply wasn't our cup of tea and for the price there are many other options out there.
