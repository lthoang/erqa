Reviews:
"We have lots of game nights with other families and thought this would be a good addition to our inventory of games.
It was moderately entertaining but it just did not have ""staying power"" like many of our other games.
This is not a huge problem as we just switch to another game.
You have game options with this.
The timer/revealer is really, really cheap and it detracts from that particular game.
With the prices of games these days, I don't understand why parts are so cheap.
If you are really into brand names, this would probably be a good game for you."
I am a very tough critic when it comes to games, and it is very hard to impress me.
I like the old tried and true games: Clue, Monopoly (classic), Sorry, Trouble, etc...
But, I have to admit this game was a lot of fun!
My son is a walking advertisement for television commercials and billboards.
It is amazing how easily ads really absorb into a child's brain, so he is better at the game than I thought he would be.
We tweaked gameplay a little because there are only 3 of us in the family that are able to play (our 2 month old was just really happy to be there).
My 8 year old was animated and excited throughout the whole game.
Actually, he sat and played the game by himself and our 2 month old for awhile just acting out, describing, and drawing the LOGOs from the cards.There are 180 action cards and you must either Do It, Draw It, or Describe It as you move your pawn around the color-coded board.
There are also 120 Reveal It cards that you use with the special LOGO timer.
We do not have the original LOGO board game, so I'm not sure how that compares.
Overall, if you are keen to spot brand name LOGOs, then this is definitely the game for you.
I would highly recommend this game and I would purchase again or for a gift.
"""Logo Party"" gives players the chance to guess famous logos in a variety of ways.
Depending on what type of card you draw, you will try to have other players guess the logo by drawing the clues (like Pictionary), acting out the item (as in Charades), or describing the brand (like the old game show ""Pyramid"".)
Players have twenty seconds to guess the brand from the clues provided.
Each team has a token to move around the board and try to get to the end first by guessing more brands than the other team.
The game includes a tablet for the drawing clues and a box to hold the cards during play and for storage.
Unfortunately, the box is too small and the cards don't fit well.The game is designed for four or more players divided into two teams.
The recommended ages are listed as eight and up, but most eight-year-olds would be unfamiliar with many of the brands featured in the game.
In fact, even older teens and adults won't know some of these brands.
Also, I would call some of the items products and not brands.
For example, one of the ""brands"" is Chicken McNuggets (as opposed to McDonald's.
)The game is somewhat fun, but would be much better with a large group of people.
My family found it almost impossible to act out most of the brands, but it was funny to see people try to act things out like ""Tupperware"".
With more people, I'm sure it would be even funnier.Throughout the boards, there are spaces called, ""Reveal It"".
When landing on this space, players from both teams try to guess a brand by looking at the logo.
This is also how the winner is ultimately determined when teams reach the end of the game board.
The timer that comes with the game doubles as a holder for these cards.
"Logo party is for folks who are consummate consumers...there I said it.If you don't do much shopping or you aren't a couch potato watching television all the time, then this game will be lost on you.However, I am both, so playing this game is a bit of a hoot.The object is to identify the logos to the brand.It can be a lot of fun - but watch out if you don't have a full contingent of people who are ""aware"" it tends to alienate and bore folks."
Obviously this game is intended to be played with a large group (hence the name party) but we didn't have that so we tried it with two small teams.
It was not the best family experience we ever had with a game, but I do think it might have worked out better with more people.The major problem was that the directions could have been better.
We immediately ran into trouble with the draw it cards.
It seems as if the timer does not give enough time for drawing and guessing.
It put way too much pressure on the drawer and caused confusion because the directions didn't explain if there was a difference between how the different card categories were timed.
It didn't seem fair to our players that you had to draw and guess in the same amount of time that you could use words or actions to get your team to guess correctly.Also, the timer was a bit difficult to get working and was almost more trouble than it was worth adding to the frustration.
Our kids ended up in a fight as a result of the sort of open to interpretation rules for play.Not our favorite family game but we will try again when we get a larger group together.
Perhaps the next game will be lots of fun now that we've got a better hold on how to best enjoy it.
Looking forward to the big group game!
We have the Logo Game and like it a lot.
We often play it in teams just because there are so many of us.
When we saw this one we got pretty excited to try it out.
It is lots of fun, just challenging enough, and family friendly.
We would recommend to a friend.
This is a fun game if you're up on logos and advertising.
Our group was familiar with most of the logos, but there were a few that we didn't know, as they are not local to us.
It was tricky to try to describe, draw, or act out the brand names.
I gave this game to my teenage nephew, who played it with several family members and friends.
They found the instructions not really hard, but very long and involved, and it took awhile for them to figure out how to play the game.
They tried to follow the rules, but ended up playing the game according to their own &#34;house rules.&#34;The game comes with a timer, which makes a very loud noise.
They eventually stopped using the timer because the noise was so annoying.
One player even thought that the timer might have been broken.
The timer went off completely on its own, making that obnoxious noise.
Another player, an adult woman, did not enjoy the game at all, but the teens enjoyed the aspect of the game that required you to draw or to describe a product or the logo or symbol for a product.
The game seems to be a combination of Pictionary and Charades and Trivial Pursuit.
The kids thought this was a good, creative game, with a combination of old and new products.
This aspect of the game made it good for mixed age groups.
As other reviewers have said, this game is best played in teams.
I have the feeling that this experiment may have gone better if at least one player had really understood how to play the game so that so much time would not have been consumed in trying to understand the rules.The teens are willing to give this game another try.
I am going to edit this review after they do to see if they enjoyed the game more.
I have a feeling they will, especially as they become more familiar with it.
I am a huge board games fan, from Guesstures and Taboo to Scattergories and Life.
Logo Party is similar to me to Cranium in that you use different forms of play in order to get your team to get the answer.
A mix of Pictionary, Guesstures, and Trivial Pursuit.
The last game because you have to know and  recognize logos that are prevalent in our culture.
Present day logos and logos from long ago.
My seven year old son was able to play well and my three year old daughter like the energy and excitement we shared.
All in all, a fun party game.
We played this game for the first time with our Thanksgiving guests.
It was a hit!
The game is played in two teams.
There is a game board with two playing pieces that make their way around the board until they reach the Logo Party space where the team arriving there first has to solve a &#34;reveal it&#34; to win.
As you go around the board teams take turns pulling a card and doing what it says based on the color of the space you are on and the instructions on the board.
There are 4 different playing options on each card and the color of the space you are on determines which one you use.
There is Reveal it, do it, describe it and draw it.
Do it is like charades.
Describe it is telling people about it without naming it.
Draw it is like one of the popular drawing games.
Reveal it is when you put a special logo card in the little timer and it is revealed slowly.
The first person to recognize it shouts it out and the point goes to their team.The little timer is somewhat of a concern because I'm not sure how long it will last and it is used for each play.
The other minor concern / annoyance is that the action cards and the reveal cards are stuffed so tightly in a little box that they are hard to pull out as you play.
That does not affect the enjoyment of the game however.
This game has elements of several popular party games and the combining of them into one game was a very smart move on the author's part.
This is an interesting concept for a board game and there are four different ways to play.
Basically, you need to be on top of your brands and logos.There's a card revealer that slowly displays the image of a logo and players need to guess the logo.
You can also draw a picture about the brand or you can describe the brand verbally or act out the brand in order to get the other players to guess the logo.
My kids had the most fun with the card revealer.There are some brands that were difficult to guess, but there is a great variety which makes it fun for all ages.
I brought out the Logo Party game while entertaining a group of friends and it contributed to our fun evening.
Most of us have business backgrounds so we enjoyed working with commercial company graphics.
Plus, since various actions are required to play the game, acting out, drawing, etc., players are using different skill sets.
No one was bored.The timer device is annoying &#8211; both the noise and the basic functionality which explains a four star instead of five star rating.
That one flaw aside, it is a terrific game.
I recently busted out the Logo Party Game during a house party and the results are in: this game is extremely entertaining to play in groups and was one of the highlights of a really great party.
Everyone loves logos and brand marketing, and putting people to the test on their knowledge of logo identification in such a creative way really leads to a fun time.
The four different ways to play make the game extremely entertaining and help keep it from getting boring or stale.
We played for over three hours and I can guarantee that people will be asking me to bring it along for the next house party.
My daughter and I often play a phone app where you have to name a pictured logo.
It is frustrating sometimes because you may be close on spelling or something and still can't get it.
I worried that this game might be simply the same thing (&#34;Name this Logo!&#34;), but it is different!!
!Yes, it is based on corporate logos (hence the name!!
ha ha!!)
but it isn't a simple game of flashcards.
You may have to DRAW the logo yourself, OR you may have to describe it, or even act it out (the funniest!)
The logos aren't just new ones, so the younger people don't have too much edge over older folks.
like me!
:) I have a small (like 12x15) dry erase board that we use for the drawing segment...it isn't necessary (you can use paper) but we like the board better.I often play games with a group of middle and high school kids and they LOVE this one.
There aren't many that they will play and even less that they actually request.
This is one of them!
We prefer the original version of this Spinmaster game.
The addition of different activities such as draw it / do it, do not add enjoyment to the game (in fact it can be quite the opposite).None of our family members want to play this game again.
We all prefer Logo Board Game.Here's my review of Logo Board Game...I recommend purchasing it instead:This review is from: Logo Board Game (Toy)I was looking for a game to add to our rotation of family games and happened upon The Logo Board Game.
We all enjoy the Logo Quiz Ap, so I thought this would be worth a try.There are a few questions that ask you to identify a Logo, but that's not what this game is really about.
It's really a trivia game.
You may have questions on a card that are centered around a theme such as &#34;candy&#34; or &#34;xbox&#34;, but you may draw a &#34;pot luck&#34; card where the questions are more random.The rules are easy to learn and you can easily unbox this game, read the rules and be playing in 5 minutes.The game is rated ages 12 and up.
It does not contain anything inappropriate for younger children.
However, their consumer knowledge is relatively limited, so they are at a great disadvantage with this game.
Even 12 year olds will have a hard time competing with older consumers who might know the &#34;Calgon, take me away&#34; ad campaign from years ago.
I think this is best played in teams if you are playing with kids.
A parent or grandparent paired with a tween or younger teen would make a great choice.
This game is fun, I hope you have some drawing skills.
Draw it, they guess it, reveal it, and have a blast winning.
This is fun especially for those who have never heard of some of these brands!
We are a family who use a lot of generic brands, so this game can be challenging for some of us.
The old saying, you learn something new every day!
This is a fun game, especially for family gatherings, or friends visiting.
So many different brands out there, famous brands, new brands, and some silly brands too.
have a crack at this game, and see if you can recognize some of these brands.
I play this with graphic designers, you see.
They love this game and the other Logo Party.
I would play it with them, not so much with kids.
I wouldn't want kids to learn brands early in life and think that is what life is about.
But designers are another thing.
We have over 50 current board games so there is always a lot to choose from when friends and family visit.
One of the things we found out was while some people were excited about the concept, there was also about as many people that thought they would do poorly so they didn't want to play.Once you get over that hurdle, generally everyone enjoyed their time playing.
The feedback was normally that it was entertaining but not their favorite game and they were NOT likely to purchase it themselves.Out of the people who had played the original Logo game, 75% preferred that one to the more complex game play/rules on this one.The actual game play has been covered so many times that I feel this type of feedback is more useful.The sad thing is that it feels like it could be more fun but something is missing that I haven't been able to figure out yet.
If you are looking for 1-4 board games, this should not be on your list.
If you are looking to add this to a collection of 10+ games, then if it interests you, I say go for it.
It is certainly a different concept that stands out from other games.
Just know you may have force some people to play before they realize it actually is fun.
:)
