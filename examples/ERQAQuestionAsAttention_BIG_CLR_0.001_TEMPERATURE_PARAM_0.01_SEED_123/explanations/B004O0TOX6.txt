Top sentence(s):
When the puzzle arrived, my two daughters (6 and 8 years old) helped me put the puzzle together.
Easy enough for a 6 year-old and challenging enough for an adult.
I wasn't so sure.
If your child is just getting into puzzles, this may be the puzzle for you.
I was really impressed with that.

Reviews:
I got this puzzle for my five year old son who loves putting puzzles together.
He loved the colorful graphics and enjoyed picking up the durable puzzle pieces.
I have to say that this is one of the nicer puzzles I've seen for kids in this age range.
The 3D aspect of the puzzle also caught the attention of my son and he enjoyed using the glasses to look at it.Pros:* Very colorful* Large durable pieces* 3D graphicsCons:* 100 piece puzzle may be too difficult for some five year old childrenI highly recommend this puzzle for young children.
This is a bright, colorful puzzle just like in the picture.
The pieces are thick and flat so they fit together nicely.
And the 3-D actually works.
The glasses are just paperboard, but someone old enough to put together a 100-pc puzzle could generally be trusted to handle them gently.
Another great quality product from Ravensburger.Bright colors, perfect fitting pieces, durable and high quality.The puzzle itself has an interesting bonus with the 3D paper glasses (included) and the fish really leap out at you, makes it a little tricky as there's only one pair for others assisting, but still fun.Overall, it was a little easy, at only 100 pieces I didn't expect hours of fun, but it was completed pretty quickly, and I think any 6 year old or older (as recommended) will have no problems.Costs a little more than cheaper puzzles, but the quality alone makes it worth it.Fun for kids and adults assisting.
My kids loved putting this puzzle together.
The colors are vibrant and the fish are cute in a cartoon-y way.
The pieces are like all of the Ravensburger puzzles we've seen - sturdy, compressed cardboard.
They snap together well and don't seem flimsy, but will bend if you're rough with them.
Apart from Melissa and Doug, I think Ravensburger is about the best manufacturer of kids' puzzles.This is 100 pieces and says 6+, but if your kids enjoy puzzles, I think it would be OK for the younger crowd as well.
My 5 and almost 4-year old had a blast with this and had it assembled in about 20 minutes with minimal help.The 3-D glasses seemed like kind of an afterthought.
Ours arrived out of the box looking a little filmy on the lenses.
A few passes back and forth between kids, and the edges bent.
They're little cardboard glasses, so I expected that.
My kids had some 3-D glasses left over from some sidewalk chalk, and those worked great.
The 3-D effect is neat, but as other reviewers have said, the puzzle is plenty cute without them (especially if you only have the glasses that come with the puzzle, as these most likely will not stand up to use).
I also liked that it came with a little mini-poster, a picture of what the puzzle looks like when complete.
One child got the box lid and one the poster to help them put together the puzzle.Overall, it's a pretty cool puzzle.
Two thumbs up from the kiddos, and 4.5 stars from mom just because of the flimsy glasses issue.
I have always liked Ravensburger puzzles for my kids.
When I saw this one, I asked my daughter if she thought it would be fun to do.
At first, she didn't want to do it.
What changed her mind was the 3D glasses.
When the puzzle arrived, my two daughters (6 and 8 years old) helped me put the puzzle together.
We enjoyed our time together--the best part of putting together a puzzle!
The pieces were great and the puzzle came together easily.
It isn't a difficult design for children their age to do--but it was challenging enough.
There aren't too many pieces with just plain blue that would make the puzzle frustrating for them.
As for the glasses--they sort of worked.
The girls liked them better than I did and most importantly they felt that they did something.
I wasn't so sure.
But, that's okay.Is it a fun fish puzzle?
Yes.
Durable?
Yes.If your kids like fish, they'll like this puzzle.
This is a really nice puzzle.
The bright, colorful pieces are thick and stay together.
Although it is recommended for kids 6 to 10, some kids as young as 4 are able to put this together.
The kids thought the 3D glasses were fun.
They said the 3D effect was cool although I couldn't see it, maybe because of my glasses.
My daughter loves jigsaw puzzles, but she loves to do them with me.
Well, about 5 minutes on the floor and I'm ready for the chiropractor.
Yes, I know, you can do the puzzle on a table, but somehow it's more fun spreading the pieces out on the floor.Fortunately, this puzzle only has 100 big pieces and is fairly easy to get together.
When it's done, pop on the included 3D glasses for a surprise.
It's 3D!
Oh, you guessed that?
Haha, you're a smart one.
But yes, the 3D is very cool.
The puzzle looks right with or without the glasses.
How they did that is a mystery to me.All in all a good jigsaw puzzle.
"My 12 year old son loves puzzles.
This one was just easy enough for him to finish in an hour or so but hard enough that he had to work for it.
He loved the glasses and having a ""prize"" at the end to be able to see something other than a finished puzzle.He did it one afternoon when he was sick home from school and was ""bored"".
It was perfect.
Took just long enough that it distracted him from his flu, but he was able to finish it one sitting.
His sister later put it together too."
Six year olds might find this one hundred piece eye stretcher a bit of a reach, but perhaps the early pre-teen and the elder adult who are not previously and irreparably addicted to the 'net or tv, etc., might fnd this temporarily diverting, especially on those blessed chilly winter evenings of no power and no phone.
My six year old, who loves puzzles, was very happy this one.
It took her about a half an hour to complete.
The puzzles pieces are made from a substantial cardboard and have a nice smooth feel to them.
They are larger pieces, and I'd say they're just about right for the 5-8 age group.
The box the puzzle comes in is very sturdy, so it should hold up well for years.
The 3-D glasses are flimsy, though, so I don't anticipate them lasting long unless they are treated very gently.
"This puzzle is for ages 6+ but my 8 year old found it pretty easy to assemble.
It is not as challenging as other Ravensburger puzzles, but the crystal clear and vibrant full color pieces makes a lovely finished scene.
The underwater creatures are friendly and varied, each with details enough to keep young kids interested.
The 3D glasses make the whole picture come alive.
Pieces are about 2"" long and matte coated to make them durable.
A nice way to pass a rainy day."
"My 6 and 9 year-olds thoroughly enjoyed putting this puzzle together and found it to be neither too difficult nor too easy.
It comes with one pair of clear cromadepth glasses, which they fought over, and when you look through them, there is a slight illusion of depth.
It was nothing to wow me, but my kids thought it was cool.
The puzzle has a satiny finish, and if you should lose the glasses, as inevitably we will, the experience of putting the puzzle together won't be diminished.
It is a bright, colorful underwater scene, with enough realism that you do a double-take when you realize that a few of the fish seem to be smiling and looking at you--a surreal ""gotcha!"""
I got this for my Pre K class.
I always have a few who can do the harder puzzles.
We had to share the glasses (which is not a bad thing) the children couldn't wait to get the puzzle together so there was a lot of team work involved.
The bright colors made it easier for them to put the puzzle together.
We have put it together and taken it apart many times now and it is holding up well.
We leave out the puzzle during the day so others can use the glasses and then break it down for the next day.
I have other classes wanting to borrow it.
It is a big hit with the 5 year old crowd.
"Pros: This Underwater World 100 Piece puzzle is as vibrant as pictured.
The cardboard pieces are large-sized and sturdy.
The puzzle goes together quickly when the whole family (with a variety of ages) works on it together.
The fish are different enough to allow kids to pick out their pieces and put them together but some are also similar enough to make this task fun and a bit challenging.
Also, younger kids who don't have the patience to find the outline pieces first, can work on the individual fish pieces.Other Notes: The puzzle contains a color photograph (also in 3D) of the final product, so you have this copy and the cover of the box as reference materials for the kids while they assemple the puzzle.
The 3D aspect works on both the finished puzzle and enclosed picture, but does not have as much ""pop"" value as the kids expected.
This could be in part because they worked to make the picture still look okay in 2D without the glasses.The product is fun for assembling and the novelty of the 3D aspect but does not have much educational value or likely reassemble value.
I'd buy this and when finished glue it together to hang in the kid's room; which you can do as the 2D aspects of the picture still look fine without the 3D glasses."
I got this puzzle for my kids.
My son is 7 and my daughter is 4.
They were excited to do this puzzle because of the 3D aspect of it.
I expected it might take them at least an hour to put it together.
Sadly, all of us did not get exactly what we wanted.
My kids finished the puzzle in less than 15 minutes and the 3D effect only excited them for a couple of minutes longer and they haven't thought about it since.I rated this puzzle 3 stars overall because it is a pretty puzzle and it is somewhat unique in that it does the 3D but that is about the extent of the good.Please, if you are looking for a challenging puzzle for children that like to do puzzles, look at something else.
If your child is just getting into puzzles, this may be the puzzle for you.
My 4.5 year old enjoyed putting together this puzzle with an adult.
The scene is nice and may remind kids of Nemo.
But the 3D effect is very minimal.
My child couldn't note any effect at all.
When I tried, a couple of the fish had a slight dimensionality to them that wasn't there without the glasses, but really not enough to make it seem like the scene was 3D, or to get excited about.As a puzzle, this product is good, especially for kids who like fish or underwater scenes.
But the 3D effet is not what we expected.
As usual, this Ravensburger puzzle is well-made and of high quality.
The pieces are sturdy and fit together well.
The marine subject is bright and colorful.
The puzzle arrives clean with no cardboard dust in the box or covering the pieces.While I thought the 3d feature (with included glasses) was something of a gimmick and not very impressive, my kids (7 and 3) enjoyed it and got a kick out of wearing the glasses.
My kids put it together multiple times the first day and have gotten it out several times since then.
If your kids enjoy puzzles, I recommended it.
"My puzzle-loving 5 and 7-year-olds couldn't wait to put this puzzle together.
We wondered how the Cromadepth 3-D effect would work and if it would make the puzzle look fuzzy without the glasses.
Once the puzzle is completed, the 3-D is a nice effect, but it's really just a gimmick.
The completed picture with its vivid colors is beautiful and enjoyable by itself: you don't need the glasses (which are flimsy and won't last long).This is a high quality puzzle with no ""puzzle dust"" and pieces that fit together nicely.
The pieces feel strong and durable and should last a long time without fading or peeling.
The puzzle pieces are large enough for my preschooler to manipulate without frustration and there are enough pieces to make the puzzle fun for my 7-year-old.
I also enjoyed putting this together--and had to hold myself back so that the kids could play.This 100-piece puzzle would make a great gift for a 5-8 year old or for a primary grade teacher to use in the classroom.
It might be a little too simple for older kids."
We put this together with a 3 yr old and she is quite good at puzzles.
We gave her some help but she was doing quite well.
The puzzle pieces are sturdy and large for small hands.
There is a full color print included in the box to help in the putting together, it also goes 3D with the glasses.
The glasses are cardboard and will fit adults and children, they have clear lenses not the old time red and green.It truly looks 3D with the glasses on, myself not a 3D person felt a bit dizzy but everyone else thought it was cool.
Will be great to have around when children visit.High quality product and the fish are beautiful.
I gave this puzzle to my five-year-old son as soon as I got it.
The box says 6+ so if your child has already been building puzzles, this should be no problem for them.
I helped him a few times, but all in all, I think it's a great puzzle for that age range, especially kids who love fish/sea life.The pieces are very nice and sturdy.
No cheapo cardboard.
I was really impressed with that.
The pieces are very nicely cut and fit together great.
And there didn't seem to be any confusion where the wrong piece was forced into a spot it looked like it should fit.
It comes with a sheet of what the puzzle should look like (which is also 3D).
Flimsy glasses and the 3D is nothing too great, but it's a cute added feature.
The picture looks great without the glasses, you certainly don't need them to enjoy this puzzle again and again.Highly recommended for young kids who love puzzles.
My 7-year old and I loved putting this puzzle together.
The pieces are very durable and strong, the pieces fit together perfectly and fortunately, no pieces were missing.My son and I liked the 3D effect as the colors to this puzzle are very vibrant.
I would highly recommend this one for kids!
The brightly colored cardboard box contains dozens of colorful puzzle pieces as well as a pair of 3D glasses.
My grandchildren and I worked on it for most of the afternoon as the 4 year-old kept trying to tear the piece apart.
When we finally finished it, we added the glasses and what do you know?
A 3D puzzle appeared.
I highly recommend this as fun family entertainment.
Easy enough for a 6 year-old and challenging enough for an adult.
As with all Ravensburger's puzzles and games - this is a high quality, well-made product.
Thick card-board puzzle pieces fasten together easily but firmly and stay connected.
My 4-year old and I enjoyed putting this puzzle together in about 15 minutes - the puzzle pieces are fairly simple and standard, easy for anyone to do.The fish are bright and vivid - super colorful compared to the dark background, so that when you use the 3D glasses to view the finished masterpiece the fish 'pop' into view and seem to be swimming towards you.Only 1 pair of 3D glasses is included and they are flimsy paper ones, so you do need to take care to store them properly in the box when not being used.
My grandsons, 5 and 7, love puzzles.
We enjoyed working on this one together.
The puzzle is well made; the pieces are sturdy.
The picture is eye-catching, bright and colorful.While the puzzle product is great, the 3D is not.
The kids took a quick look with the glasses and weren't impressed.
There was only a slight 3D effect.
They could do without it.
The puzzle stands on its own.
"I have two children, a boy who just turned 5 and a girl who is 3 and 1/2 years old.
They both love jigsaw puzzles and we are constantly looking for fun puzzles that are age appropriate and fun and challenging for them both.
We've had some very good luck with ""underwater puzzles"" so we decided to give this a try...As a puzzle, this is a great puzzle for the kids and they loved this puzzle and enjoyed trying to figure out the various fish and undersea plant life.
They particularly enjoyed the clown fish and thought he was Nemo.The pieces were well-made and fit together well.
This is obviously important as you want the puzzle to last and you want the puzzle to go together easily so the kids won't get frustrated.
In many cases it is already tough enough for them to figure out the pieces and the last thing you want is for them to be frustrated with pieces that don't go together well EVEN WHEN they are lined up correctly.
This puzzle scores well in both of these categories.HOWEVER, there is one problem.
It really isn't very 3D.
To start off, the 3D glasses are flimsy and while they ARE gray (not the old red and blue style glasses) they aren't made very well.
They were torn and bent before we were done with the puzzle for the first time.
Even worse, they effect just isn't very good.
The fish don't POP off the screen and if you are buying for the 3D effect, you will be disappointed.Other than the flimsy 3D glasses and the mediocre 3D effect, this is a nice under-sea puzzle that entertained my 3 and 5 year olds very well."
This is a great puzzle and my kids loved it.
The only complaint is that 100 pieces is just not all that many for my 7 year old who has moved on from that a long time ago.
Other than a small disagreement on the suggested age, it's a great product and good fun.
I'm not really an avid jigsaw puzzle enthusiast, so this easier children's puzzle was more my speed, and one that can be done in a couple sittings--it could have been done in one.
Once the edge pieces are found, it goes together relatively quickly.
Since there are so many details with different colors, it's easy to figure out the puzzle by looking at the picture.The fish have a fun, slightly anthropomorphic look, complete with smiles!
The seahorse, and distant shark and whale look a lot more realistic.The 3D effect is good, especially at the bottom of the puzzle, where the graphic appears to have a few different levels of depth.
Maybe because of the jigsaw cuts, it's slightly challenging to see the 3D effect, but there's also an included insert showing the design of the puzzle that can be looked at for a clearer view.It's a fun puzzle to do, and a nice size!
I did this puzzle with my 4 year-old and my 6 year-old kids and they both liked it--it wasn't too hard or too easy for either of them.
The pieces fit together snugly and accurately.
The material is thick enough to resist a fair amount of abuse.
The end product is 3D with the included glasses and it actually worked much better than I had thought it would.
I would easily recommend this to anyone who wants a puzzle that you can put together in about 10-15 minutes (your mileage may vary depending on your puzzling skills and how many little hands are involved).
