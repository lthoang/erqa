Reviews:
This is the perfect game for my daughter.
She's five and she loves to build things and this is the perfect amount of challenge in order to keep her thinking throughout.
She has fun playing with us, but she also enjoys playing with this by herself, trying to match up the picture on the card and build her own designs as well.I will say, the challenge level is perfect for her, but I can't see how this would entertain her as she gets much older.
The age range on the box (5-15) doesn't seem accurate.
I cannot see a 15 year old being interested in this at all.
My wife thought it was too easy and found no interest in it at all.
My youngest daughter just throws the pieces around, so we play this when she goes down for a nap.
Like I said, my eldest loves it.
It is perfect for her age.There are enough cards to offer plenty of different buildings to build, and I love that it challenges her to really think about what she's doing and how she places her blocks in order to keep her building up.
It may not teach her a lot of things, but she is learning to `think' about what she does, which is important.
It has a limit to the amount of usage you'll get out of it, but for a toy that will keep my five year old interested and engaged, this works really well.
I've heard that the Lego variation of the same concept is more advanced and offers different levels of challenge, so maybe that would be ideal for families with older kids, but for us this works just fine for the time being.
Based on my observations, kids aged mature-4 to 6 seem to enjoy this the most.
The game is a simpler version of the adult version without the timer.
In the days of electronic games, this is a refreshing break.
Also, instead of being limited to a 2-dimensional boardgames, I like that this game makes kids practice spacial reasoning.
"Sort of...more like knocking down ;)Who doesn't love building things and then trying to destroy them?
Nobody!
This is the starting point of the ""god game"" god game for the little ones who may eventually crack open a session of Populous and the like.
Durable and simple diversion that you can't go wrong.
Oh and it's not just for kids.
:p"
"The premise of this game is simple: you look at a picture on the card and position your blocks to match the picture.
There are two sets of cards, so you can choose the easier version (and they're REALLY easy, perfect for a 4-year-old), or a slightly more complex version (which even young kids can do after they've gotten the hang of it).
I appreciated its suggestions for different types of gameplay, like:* Race to see who finishes first* A non-competitive ""everyone build it!""
approach* You can give the younger child the easier set of cards, while the older child (or parent) uses the more difficult set* The older child or parent can create the same object, but is restricted to building with only one handIt was fun and challenging, and my kids played it for days.
They haven't sought it out lately (it's been a couple of months), but as a parent I'm inclined to find it so I can encourage them to play it again, because they do enjoy it,and it develops their spacial skills."
Its a very cute game and my 4.5 year old loves it.
You pick a card and each player has to build the block formation shown on it.
The cards have a side using 3 blocks or the other more advanced side using 5 to 6 blocks.
Since the rules of the game state that the first person done wins the coin (cardboard coins come with the game), we modified the rules.
The modification is because my daughter can't always build the shapes so we say if each player can build the shape, they get a coin.
I know many would think this is a cop out but when an adult is playing with their child or there is one child in the group who has great motor and mechanical skills, the others get frustrated and give up given the time pressure.
"My husband and I had an awesome time playing this without our kids.
It is much better than the regular version.
You and however many people you're playing with try to build the structure on the card and grab the block in the middle first (like spoons).
Some of the structures are relatively complicated and if you knock your structure over on your way to grab the block then you have to start over.
It's fast paced and really entertaining.
The scoring is simple, there are no timers to mess with, and the components are great quality.
We really enjoyed it.Having said that, I know it's a junior version but having to set up a row of blocks isn't much of a structure (which is on some of the cards), so that was kind of disappointing.
I also wish there were more cards because you start repeating the structures really quickly.The other weird thing is that it says 2 to 5 players, but if you have 5 ""players' one is supposed to be the game master.
That kind of make sense because the person flipping has a disadvantage, but that's not really someone who's actually playing.
So really it's 2-4 people that can actually play.Honestly, there's no reason this should be junior.
They should replace the adult version with this game and just sell one - it's awesome."
We have three board game playing kids in the house.
13, 12, and 11.
When we go to restaurants and they get 'bored' they build things out of sugar packets, jelly packets, creamers you name it.
We also have the Lego game that presents a card and requires you to collect the pieces necessary to build the object pictured.
This game is similar, except there are no directions on how to build the item and the blocks don't interlock, you must create the stability of the structure and you must figure out the engineering of the structure on the card.This game is a lot of fun.
We have probable whizzer through it at least 12 times since we've had it.
The kids like to pull it out and build the designs in the pictures without playing the game when they are waiting for someone else to come and play.
We are going to get the adult version.
(the kids are 2 boys and 1 girl).
It's fun for both sexes and all the ages in our house.
Dad isn't a fan, but he's not as into board games as the kids and I are.
Make N Break Jr is a unique game unlike any I've seen.
Each player receives a set of 6 wooden blocks at the beginning of the game.
Next, a card is drawn from a deck which shows various illustrations of uniquely shaped structures.
Players compete to re-create the structure shown on the card by building it with their blocks.
Fast players are awarded points whereas those completing the build the slowest are not.
First player to reach 10 points wins.
It is a very simple premise, but one that proves to be quite fun.
Gameplay is simple enough for anyone to understand, even young kids.
Games themselves move very quickly, lasting about 20 minutes for our family of 4.
The only downside is that because the game relies on motor skills and spatial recognition, younger players who understand the game just fine will find if more difficult to match the building speeds of older players.
Though the game is recommended for 5 years & up, playing with mixed ages can still be problematic.
This can be rectified a bit by having younger players compete to build an easier structure at the same time that older players compete to build a more complex structure, asthe cards are two-sided, with a simpler structure on one side and a more complicated one on the other.
But even with this equalizing gameplay tweak, we still find that mom & dad can win out most of the time over our 7 year old son.
Though it frustrates him, he still enjoys the game along with the rest of the family, especially when we pull back a bit on the competitive spirit and let him stay in the game.All in all this is a creative and fun game that is simple, accessible, and rewarding.
Definitely recommended!
I have a three year old which is young according to the age range of 5-15 listed on the box, however he has loved playing with it.
As a parent I love that he has to look at a picture and find the corresponding pieces to create the same picture.
Although he does ask for help, he can do a good portion by himself.
Plus, like any boy, he also enjoys the knockdown:).
As he gets a little older, we will be able to really play it like a timed game, but for now it is a wonderful tool that allows him to work on several skills while at play.My biggest critic is that the age range sounds much too broad.
I do not see kids 12-15 wanting to play this game, however they may enjoy making it more competitive.
My son is four.
He has enjoyed trying to build all the sames and without the need for speed can build most of the games.
Fine motor skills are used in this game and I do feel that the recommended age of 5-15 is a bit old.
Personally I think this would be more 4-10.
There are two levels of cards.
These cards could be bend by over excited children.
The blocks are bright and wooden and I would say durable.
This game does provide a level of competition but I would say that for children who have fine motor skills issues this is a nice exercise to improve those skills.
Overall it is a nice game but for the younger child rather than the older.
Make N Break Junior is a simple game that can be fun for the whole family.
As other reviewers have pointed out, it all depends on the age and building capabilities of your children.
The game is really straightforward so you can be up and running in now time.
I like that it improves building and spatial abilities in my kids while fostering healthy competition.
This new addition to the popular Ravensburger games and toys can keep your  kids 5-99 busy !
The Ravensburger toys have proven to be very popular over the years.
They are interesting, colorful, durable and enjoyed by kids (and parents, too.)
This current one is the junior version of the already popular games.
Playing the game can be quite a challenger for the youngsters, but the more they play, the more they'll enjoy it.
There is no time limit that is set, but the winner gets the reward with a chip, and the task of Master Builder is passed on.
This game will keep the kids busy !
My son who is 5 1/2 really likes this game.
It can be played solo--pull a card and build what's on it.
It can be played against an adult--one hand only or use non-dominant hand.
There are two levels of cards, and already the first level was too easy for him.
Make N Break is a good prequel to Trucky if your child likes this type of game (and to Tetris for that matter).
Trucky is more challenging but is not a two player game.
My 6-year-old enjoys playing games, but we find that a lot of games that are designed for her age level are just overly simplistic and become boring after a while.
They also require her to understand and care about the rules of the game before they even get started.
What we liked about this game is that it's simple to play, the rules are simple to explain, and we could teach her to play in just one round.Play is pretty simple: A deck of cards shows prebuilt structures that players compete to build fastest.
The first player who builds the structure (or the first two or three, depending on how many players in the game) earns a coin.
The game winner is the first player to reach ten coins.My daughter is not at all competitive, and she doesn't generally like to follow game rules, but the play in this game is very quick-paced, so it's actually great for helping to build concentration and a sense of urgency.
We had to adapt a bit to play with her so that she could win (or lose) fairly, but we followed the suggestion in the box to play one-handed against her.
I could see how this would be much more fun for her to play with other kids her age, but it was still a fun family game.
I also liked that a game could be played relatively quickly before I got bored.This seems a very minor consideration, but since the game will be handled by children, I feel it important to mention that the game comes in a very sturdy box that is clearly a higher quality than what you find in typical board games.
The box, as well as the plastic inserts that hold the game cards and pieces, are very sturdy and nice looking.
They make it worth spending a few dollars extra to know that everything will stay together.
In fact, even the game blocks come in a reusable, re-sealable bag.This isn't a game that will be played every day, but it is one that will be played often.
My children (ages 6, 5, 3, and almost 2) love playing this game.
They've made up their own rules, because they didn't particularly like the original ones completely.
(And the 2 year old's permanent position is the breaker of the buildings.)
They look at the cards and build what they see.The block quality surprised me.
They are wooden blocks, not plastic.
(Big bonus!)
They are also more stained than painted.
(You can see the wood grain through the color.)
I think the higher quality attributes a lot to how much they enjoy playing.
Building with sturdy wooden blocks in much easier than building with lighter plastic blocks.
"I have purchased several Ravensburger games and have never been disappointed.
Make N Break Junior doesn't disappoint either.
Shuffle the cards, place them in the plastic card tray.
Take the top card and place it in the card holder for all players to see, and start building.
The first person to build the same design as is on the card, grabs the block designated as the ""done"" block (similiar to grabbing the spoon during the Spoon game) and if their structure matches the card, they get a chip.
At the end, the player with the most chips is declared the winner.
The game comes with wooden blocks (a nice touch), and yellow or red cards.
The yellow cards are easy structures and the red cards are a little harder.
The game states it is for 5-15 year olds, but I think anyone over the age of 7 would have more fun playing the regular Make N Break game.
The game is fun and addictive and you can change the rules for the older players(ex: have them build with their left hand).
I recommend this game."
"This is my kind of game...good quality, real wood blocks (I love wood versus plastic for my children), and it is a game that lets children entertain themselves instead of them ""being entertained"" by it.
None of this would matter if my children didn't like playing it...but they do.
My children have asked several times to play this since receiving it and they stay interested in it for a considerable amount of time.
I usually have to tell them it's time to stop playing or they'll just keep going.Quality...the blocks stack well, are nicely painted, smooth, and a nice size even for my 3 year old.
The cards are two-sided and laminated, the pictures are very clear, and the card holder/stand is a very well thought out addition to the game.
The card with the picture to be built is placed standing up in a slot that lets everyone see it at once.
The box is also very nice.
I hate boxes that I have to tape back together after a few uses.
This one is sturdy with the same nice coating as Ravensburger's puzzles.This game is nice for fine tuning visual-spatial and motor skills too...especially when played by the rules where the players are racing against each other.
The patterns to build remind me a lot of the neuro-psych/IQ tests I used to administer...the game would be a useful assessment tool for occupational/rec/child therapy if one knew what to look for.
I think the game would also be good to help keep an aging brain sharp.
This is a game I'd have sought out and bought if I'd known about it.The only down side I've run across is that without some supervision my children tend to spread out and potentially lose pieces...so it could be annoying to track down all of the cards and blocks and chips to keep the game intact.
I'm not always willing to do this and just get rid of ""sets"" and games with tons of small pieces.
I think this one's worth a little effort."
From the minute it arrived, the 4-yr old was excited about this game.
I think it was the building blocks that got him excited, but he also loved that it had simple rules and is pretty much a race (he loves to race).
Plus you get to knock things over.
It would probably be more fun for kids of similar age to play together.
As it is, I tend to try and limit myself to two fingers for building to make it a little more even match between us.
He thinks it's quite a bit of fun and I love watching his cognitive processes and motor skills improve as we play.
Great game for kids!
Basically you build with the blocks to try to be the first to complete the structure.
It takes fine motor skills, hand eye coordination and concentration to balance the blocks - all important skills.
My 2 1/2 year old trys her best to do it as does my special needs son who is 12 - who has motor issue and enjoys playing this game as its not to hard for him yet it does fully challenge him.When not playing the game, he looks at the game cards and tries to make each structure, which is great practice for him.
Great game for young kids and special needs kids.
"My test kidlets (ages 4 and 7) have been guinea pigs for me for a number of different games so far, but I can say that hands-down this one is their favorite game.
They didn't want to stop playing it, and were laughing and enjoying themselves the entire time they played it.
The 4 year old called dibs on it and said that it was his ""builder"" game.The game is simple: each player gets six blocks of one color and has to try to build the shape indicated on a card before the other players.
The deck of cards is printed with an easier shape on one side and a harder shape on the other, which is good for different age groups.
The easy side was great for the 4 year old, and the harder side was better for the 7 year old.
The first person to complete their shape has to grab a neutral-colored block that is placed upright in the middle of the playing field.
If they happen to knock down their tower when reaching for the block, they have to rebuild it before they can grab the neutral block again.
The person who wins the round gets a token with a cartoon builder's picture on it.My 7 year old niece tended to win most of the rounds, but in order not to make her little brother (who loves anything to do with building) feel bad, she decided that if they were both close to grabbing the neutral block at the same time, that it would be considered a tie and they would both get a token.
So we wound up the game with each of them having an equal amount of tokens and everyone was happy.
Her rules might be useful for others where there is an age disparity between the dexterity levels of the kids.
;-)The game is simply but sturdily made.
The blocks are made out of wood and nicely painted in basic colors.
There is a tray provided to store the tokens and the card deck, and it is designed so that the card in play can be displayed.
The tokens are made of a sturdy cardboard and there are a lot of them, so if a few go missing along the way (as usually happens with games) the game is still playable (you could probably use poker chips as a replacement if needed).I foresee many, many hours of fun with this game for them.
I recommend this game highly.
I see that Ravensburger also makes this game in other versions for older children, which I will definitely keep in mind for a future gift for the kids."
"I just can't take Candyland anymore.
Or Chutes and Ladders.
Or Hi Ho Cherry O!
We have had these games for 8 years and I just can't play them again with child #2.My now 5 year old has just discovered board games and now that we have passed the tantrum-throwing-when-not-winning stage, we are looking for a few new games that we can all play without wishing a meteor would crash into the house and put us out of our misery.
Enter in the Make N Break Jr game.All four of us, myself, husband, 5 and 9 yr olds gathered around the kitchen table and unloaded the game.
I was so pleased to see an insert in the box that holds the pieces all in their own compartments.
The cards, tokens the blocks, all stay organized.
This excited me (I'm a mom and I'll take the little things).My son immediately had the hang of it.
We all did a practice round, choosing between the easier yellow cards (which use 3-4 blocks) and the harder red cards (which use 5-6 blocks).
By the second round, we were all happily using the red cards to play the game.
The hardest part was not building the structure, but not knocking it over as you grab the ""DONE"" block that signals you are the first and winner.We found my son later, at the table playing on his own, copying the cards one by one.
Then, his imagination took over and he spent another 15 minutes building and rebuilding things on his own.
BONUS!The nice thing about this game is that it is just as easy to play with 4 people as it is with 2 people.
This version is basic and I can see my now 5 year old growing out of it within the year.
We might have to try the full game after this!"
I thought our 2, 3, and 5 year old kids might have fun with this and I was right!
I also think it's good for building hand-eye coordination and following visual directions.They do have fun, but they don't like doing it competitively.
We flip a card and build it.
Then when everyone's done, we flip another.
The two year old sometimes needs extra help, but they do all have fun.I thought that the 6 blocks each wouldn't keep their interest, but it really is their favorite game.
Without the competitive rush, they just really like that they can build the things.So when you're tired of Candyland, Memory, etc, give this a try!
I can only handle so much Memory, Candyland, Chutes and Ladders, and Hi-Ho Cherry-O.
My kids - ages 3 and 5 - liked those four best... that is, before we got this.
Make N Break Junior saved me from the monotony of those favorites!The simplicity of the rules makes it easy to play - even without help from us.
You built the picture on the card using your blocks, and whoever builds it first gets a token.
The kids sometimes play it on the own, often not keeping score but just building one card's picture at a time.
Our youngest is only 14 months old now, so she isn't playing yet, but I think this game will be helpful for her fine motor skills as she gets bigger.
(She has cerebral palsy and has weekly occupational therapy to use her hands better, and it's nice to have potential therapy items as she gets bigger so she can enjoy it without feeling like it's work!
)I expect this to be a favorite for many years to come, thank goodness!
"We've had this game for all of two days and we've already played it 6 times.
My daughter is 4 and she is absolutely crazy about this game.
The idea is fairly simple.
Everyone gets a card and builds the little design of blocks depicted on the card.
When you're finished, you quickly snatch up the ""done"" block before anyone else does.
If your building looks good, you get a token for that round.There are two levels of block building (yellow cards and red cards).
My daughter uses the more simple yellow cards, while us adults have the red cards and also a one-handed handicap.
With that system, out of the 6 games we've played, my daughter has won 3 so we're just about even playing that way.Some people have said it's too simple for kids over 5.
I can see that, however, it's sort of fun to try to build crazy fast and then snatch the ""done"" block from the center of the table without knocking over your stuff.
But really, yes, I would say that this is more of a preschool age game - perhaps 6 years at the upper limit.
But that's okay, because there's a version of this game targeted at older kids, too.
Just pick upRavensburger Make 'N' Break - Family Game.As for me, I'm happy to have some variation on the same old same old rolling the dice and moving a specified number of spaces game.
This is a really neat concept and a fun way for me and my preschooler to spend an evening."
I have been really happy with Ravensburg products.
I own a lot ranging from floor puzzles to many 3D models.
This is the first game from the company that we tried.Each player chooses color blocks to build the model on the picture.
It is great for children to increase their spatial reasoning skills.
We enjoy playing this game as a family since it is simple to play and fun.
I picked up this game when our son was still too young for it (1.5 yrs old, but loves to build stuff), but have since brought it out when we had house guests with 5-6 yr olds.
The older kids enjoyed this game for about an hour, then became bored with it.
