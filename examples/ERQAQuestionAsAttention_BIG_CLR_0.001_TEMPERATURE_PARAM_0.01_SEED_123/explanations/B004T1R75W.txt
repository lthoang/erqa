Top sentence(s):
""Mini-book"" gives it way too much credit in my opinion.
They carry theirs around(each has a different one), sit it at their table, do the web thing, interact and play with each other.
It seems that eventually they will become a cute decoration piece on a shelf.
The difference with this one is with the accessories and the fact that you have to go online for a particular feature.
(Maybe I would just need to spend more time seeing what is available there.)

Reviews:
"This is one of a collection of dolls with large heads.
They remind me of those Japanese cartoons.
There's almost no body at all!
My granddaughter decided that she makes a great 'toy' for her larger doll.I had not heard of Crib Life, so it was interesting to see what it's all about.
Apparently they have several little dolls with different personalities, activities, and appearance.
There's a web site that the doll owners can visit.
It requires Windows/PC: Internet Explorer 7+, Firefox 3.5, or Chrome, or if you use a Mac: Safari 3+, Firefox 3.5+, or Chrome (Mac OS X 10.5 or later).
If you don't have Adobe Flash 10.x, you will be prompted to download it.
High-speed internet is recommended.
The instructions say to ""Always check online for latest minimum requirements.The doll is ""Made In China"" and ""Distributed in Australia by Hasbro Australia Ltd.""It is intended for ages 5+.The doll owner is invited to visit their ""crib"" and get acquainted with their ""Crib Life Cuties"" little friends, which of course they will supposedly also want to buy: Sydney Cutie, Sarina Cutie, Lily Sweet, Lulu Lake, Hailey Hula, Ella Song, and of course the one I have, Makayla Song, who ""LIKES: Making a difference, singing & playing guitar.
Makayla  is quoted as saying, ""Let's play nice 2gether and help take care of the planet!
Peace!
""The carton includes ""doll, outfit, charm, online code, and mini book.""
""Mini-book"" gives it way too much credit in my opinion.
It isn't much of a book, but then maybe it isn't intended to be.Makayla is a plastic/rubberish doll with a big head.
The head turns.
This is a great toy for my little 2-year-old granddaughter.
She loves it.The box is marked with a recommended age of 5+ years, and I'm not sure why that is.
Two thoughts occur to me.
The first is that there's a very small pair of shoes for the doll included, and maybe this is viewed as a choking hazard.
If your munchkin still shoves things in her mouth indiscriminately, you'd want to keep an eye on this.
And, in reality, I can see those tiny shoes disappearing in pretty short order.The other reason may be that this toy's evidently designed to be part of an on-line community, and very young kids really don't know how to go on-line.Anyway, that aside, the doll's really cute, kind of moppet-like, with the huge eyes and head.
It looks like it'll stand up to a lot of abuse, a good feature in toys aimed at the tot market.I guess the bottom line is that my munchkin loves it, and that's all that really matters.
I think this doll is adorable and love that it is plastic.
It seems like it will be quite durable and last through everyday playing.
It does say ages 5 and up but really if you just give your child the doll, she can probably start playing with it around 2 years old.
There are small shoes which are a choking hazard and this doll is geared towards playing on an online website called criblife.
On Criblife you can play games, watch a video and get to know the girls.
Each doll is different and has her own personality; MaKayla loves music and the guitar.
She also comes with a charm and a mini book, as well as the outfit she is wearing with headband.
The doll is also a good size for smaller kids who are too young or pre-Barbie dolls.
"I have seen Baby Alive in the stores (but never owned one).
I got this for my 5 year old because I thought she might like it.
The doll itself is very small (like 6"" tall) with a ginormous head!
The doll is in a pose like she can crawl but her head is so big and heavy it makes her tip over.
My daughter doesn't seem to mind she takes her with her when she takes a bath and has been carrying her around with her (her small size makes it easy for her small hands).
The website is cute and colorful with a few things you can print out and a couple of games.
It also has some ""shows"" starring the animated doll.
You can't gain access to all the doll shows and games unless you purchase more than one doll to get the codes.
I am a bit surprised that my 5 year old daughter is playing with her as much as she is but she seems to be enjoying herself."
This doll, Makayla Song was a gift to my 6 year old granddaughter.
She loved her at first sight.
The doll itself is small enough for her hands and fits perfectly into her Jr. size backpack.
She is plastic with molded hair and features.
Her outfit is removable and additional ones are available for purchase.
Always an advantage for little girls!
However, the dolls do hold their position, so Makayla will pretty much always be crawling.I was unsure about purchasing any toy that markets itself with an online tie-in.
It just seemed a little, I don't know, too cyber for a young child.
So, I decided that we would get online together and check it out.The online crib site is adorable!
So, so cute!
You can make a variety of dolls and hear their stories.
They each have their own cribs.
(too funny)She enjoys going back to the online site over and over and seems to never tire of hearing the same story.As a grandmother of many years, I offer some advice.
It's the same story as getting a little girl a Barbie.
Take the shoes!
They are very small, easily lost, and tears will flow!Overall, this is a sweet, adorable little doll that will bring hours of fun to a little girl with some computer skills, or a loving adult with time, who will play online with her.
My daughter has been playing with her Baby Alive Crib Life Dolls for the past week and having a lot of fun with them.
She's been building them accessories with her Legos.
I honestly didn't think she'd care too much about these dolls because she's not a huge baby doll playing girl but she's shown a liking to them and that makes me happy.Each doll arrived in great condition from Amazon.com.
I found the packing very easy to open and that's a plus for parents who have excited kids jumping up and down trying to get you to open a brand new toy.
Honestly with some things you almost have to take wire cutters to a box to free a toy, which seems over the top ridiculous in most cases.We have both Ella Song & Makayla Song!
How fun to have gotten sister dolls!
Each dolls comes with an accessory, a key chain charm, special online code, mini profile book, and an outfit.The dolls clothes can be removed easily so if your child wants to play with them in the pool or tub they can easily do that.
You don't have to worry about their hair getting ruined because they are all plastic.We checked out the crib life website together because I always supervise my child online.
We found the site cute, colorful, and easy to navigate.
Your child can play games, watch videos of their doll, and print activities out.My daughter loves the included charm key chain.
And was pretty excited that she could attach it to her backpack!
I found the charm to be made well and quite durable.The mini profile book has where your child can write down when she got her doll, her own birth date, favorite color, and other bio details.
Included as well is a list of accessories parents can purchase for their child's doll.There are a few other crib life friends to collect as well as fashion accessories.
Overall I personally love the size of the doll and like that it doesn't need batteries.
It seems to be made extremely well and I think it's perfect for any little girl that loves baby dolls.
'The Baby Alive Makayla Song Doll is a very cute and detailed doll.
I found that most of the young girls in the family immediately showed interest in the doll.
Unfortunately the doll does not articulate in any significant way.
The clothes are removable as are the shoes but it does not look as if they are interchangeable among the dolls.
The online content is a plus and it does keep the kids busy but why do the kids need to go online to view their dolls playing when they should be playing with the dolls themselves?
While there is some playtime that most children will get from these dolls, they will eventually get bored since there is no hair to brush, arms to move, etc.
It seems that eventually they will become a cute decoration piece on a shelf.
I have 2 daughters which too old and too young for this toy so this was given to my 5-year old niece.
The Baby Alive Crib Life Fashion Play Doll - Makayla Song is actually one of 3 other Baby Alive dolls that she owns.
The difference with this one is with the accessories and the fact that you have to go online for a particular feature.
This doll instills an impression for a young kid such as my niece to care and nurture a sibling which she has one.
The minute she received it, she was full of smiles and she wouldn't part with it.
Even stays beside her during bed time which is really so fun and touching to watch a little girl developing the art of caring.
I highly recommend this doll for its intended age range of 5 years and up.
I love the fact that it gives a positive impact on little girls.
"I think this doll is really cute to look at.
HeR face is cute and her outfit and feathers are colorful.
However, she has strange proportions (big head and very small body).
Our daughter (4) played with her for about 30 minutes the day she got it (about 2 months ago)  and hasn't played with it since.
I think the problem is that she doesn't have hair that can be brushed, outfits to change, or ""food"" to feed her.
She is too small for other baby stuff and isnt very cuddly.
What is there to do?"
We gave this doll to our 3 year old daughter.
She loves dolls, but most especially loves Princess Dolls.
She hasn't shown much interest in this doll, and has only played with it occasionally.
The doll is somewhat cute, with big blue eyes and an overly large head (which is about the same size as the rest of her entire body.)
She is not a soft cuddly doll, but has a hard body and head, including the hair.
The doll comes with an online code to do activities on the web.
But after plugging in the code, I couldn't find that there was much to do as far as games or other things.
(Maybe I would just need to spend more time seeing what is available there.)
The doll is recommended for ages 5 and up, and since my daughter is only 3, this could be why she is not very interested.
Overall, it's an ok doll, but probably best suited for an older child.
OK, it's a smallish, hard doll with a big head that tends to topple over.
It has a little charm and code that allows access to it's particular website.
Well, that's something anyway, I guess.I'm not that impressed with it.
I know I'm a daddy, but you can't move it's arms or legs a whole lot.
It's, of course, cute with it's little removable shoes and big eyes and colorful outfit.
I'd give a generous 3 stars.On the other hand, my little ones(2 girls: ages 5 & 7) love them.
They carry theirs around(each has a different one), sit it at their table, do the web thing, interact and play with each other.
My girls, in general, are not big into dolls or Barbies; they like watching the movies but are not into doll dress up and doll houses and so forth, but they love these, and would be upset with me if I gave it anything but 5 stars.Price is reasonable.
For the right child this is a cute doll that seems very well made.
However, my then 6 year old didn't maintain interest in it at all, despite being comfortable playing games online.
This is a real cute doll.
She is sturdy and will stand up to the test of a five year old.
I brought some of the other fashions and one other doll.
I think this doll is perfect for kids with little hands.
I let her go to the website with me and she loves to make a story and play with Makalays other friends online.
I think this is a great doll to play with and also go online with.
This doll is small, but it goes everywhere with my daughter.Overall a must have for any little girl.
"My kids were really excited when I ordered these dolls (2 different ones).
When they arrived, we opened them quickly (thankfully) and the girls really enjoyed dressing and undressing them and playing with the charms.
That lasted less than a week.PROS:They are pretty well constructed, so they can take a little abuse.They are a good size.
A small child can hold the doll's body in one hand, so they're easy to carry around.They have a connected on-line game and virutal world where your child can play (may NOT be a pro).Lots of avilable accessories and things at your local department store for play.Much more portable than larger dolls.Paint seems to hold up well.CONS:The doll is VERY top heavy and will not sit up for any length of time.The accessories are very small, which is a nightmare with younger siblings in the home.It doesn't DO anything.
It's just a doll.The hands do not grip well.
She cannot hold her own ""keychain"".The shoes fall off too easily.The clothes are so tiny that they are easily lost once removed.Because the doll has very few features and we didn't invest in a lot of toys/accessories, these didn't keep my kids' interest for more than a week.I'm not a big fan of on-line gaming for small children.
The reasons for my aversion are personal, so I won't get into it here.
So the gaming features was not a plus for me.
I just see it as another on-line activity that has to be monitored.Overall, I'm not really excited about the dolls and I'm really glad we didn't invest in them.
Definitely wouldn't buy again."
My six year old adores these mini dolls.
I don't quite understand the attraction, but I feel like it has something to do with the fact that they come with a webkinz type code that you can use to access the Crib Life website.
The code seems to really up the cool factor for little girls.That being said, the Crib Life website leaves much to be desired.
Beyond dressing up an online version of your doll and listening to their theme song, there really isn't much to do.Overall, the website is less important to my daughter than having a cute mini baby doll to carry in her backpack...plus, I found these dolls at Ross for really cheap so the that the website is kind of lame doesn't bother me much.
