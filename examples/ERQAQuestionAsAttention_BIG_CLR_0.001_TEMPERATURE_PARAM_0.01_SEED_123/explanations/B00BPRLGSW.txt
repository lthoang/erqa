Reviews:
While it is certainly a good thing to recycle, this toy is still made out of plastic.
And in most cases it probably will land in a landfill after a while, when your toddler grows up and this simplistic toy gets boring.
And simplistic it is - no lights, no sounds, no nothing.
Just a plain rocket with a detachable capsule, two compartments with hinged doors, and two rather crudely modeled Astronauts.
Would this toy be out of metal, I'd say it would have a quirky 1950's charm to it.
Would it be out of wood, I'd say hand it down to the next generation.
But plastic ... well, it is washable and it floats in the bathtub, and thankfully it does not contain all those nasty and unhealthy byproducts like BPA or PVC.
"We have a few other toys from this company, including the sea plane and the tug boat, both of which are used quite often in both the pool and the bath tub.Compared to those, I would put this rocket slightly ahead in terms of enjoyment factor for our 3 YO, primarily because it's a little more interactive, with two astronauts and a detachable module.I'm personally less interested in the green aspect of these toys (although it's a factor), than I am the idea that in play, sometimes ""less is more"", which seems to be lost on the current generation of teens and younger.
Specifically, the toys this company makes are great BECAUSE they fly in the face of most modern toys:- they don't have electronics or run on batteries,- they don't make noise or have stickers- they aren't packaged in ridiculously gaudy boxes with Fort Knox level security ties.Is it too minimalist?
I personally don't think so, and in fact I think kids NEED these kinds of ""slow"" toys these days in the face of Playstations, iPad minis, and robotic animals.
Just good fuel for the imagination, not to mention these will seemingly last forever, they are so sturdily and simply made.Really enjoy everything we have from this company, and looking forward to more offerings (although they already have a pretty extensive catalog).Highly recommended."
This is one of those simple toys that the kids love!
Both the 5 y.o.
and almost 2 y.o.
grandsons are crazy about this.
It doesn't take one battery so it can make noise!
the kids furnish the noise with their imagination.
It has the astronaunts, one blue and one red that come with it but the boys have found several more little toys to put inside it so it can shake and rattle as it blasts off lol They were also using it with their Thomas the train crane and track.
It just can be played with so many things or nothing.Box said the rocket and astronaunts are made from milk cartons and it's a very simple box too!
The top red piece does come off tooI say it's probably the best toy the boys have gotten all year!
this toy is so awesome.. the kids in the house 3-8 will all play with it.. it comes with 2 little space men that are light  weight.
The top of the rocket comes off so you can have space adventures.
this toy will make all moms and dads happy as the whole toy can go in the dishwasher for a full deep squeaky clean.
We adore the Green Toys line!
A few years ago, we added the Garbage Truck into our home, and it has remained one of the most played with toys!
Last year we added the airplane, and this year we've got to add the tractor, a boat, and this rocket.These are wonderful, DURABLE toys, and money well spent when it comes to toys.
My children LOVE playing with them.
They use their imagination and the only noise made is from them.
They require no batteries, and my brain doesn't feel like it's going to explode from hearing loud &#34;toy noise&#34;.Another great feature is the fact that they are made from recycled material!As far as what we've experienced from the Green Toys line so far, these are wonderful, CLASSIC toys!
Highly recommended!!!
!
This is basically the best rocket toy you will find for the age range specified.
The entire toy & box are 100% recycled so you can feel extra good about yourself.
The thing is built like a brick house and will withstand aly level of destruction you child may inflict on it.
It comes with 2 rocket men.
They are moulded from one piece of plastic and are large enough to not present a choking hazard.
The top section of the rocket detaches so that your child can have an actual second stage orbit experience--a must for any rocket toy that wants to be a contender.
There are 2 hatches, on in each section, and they can be opened and closed to place the astronauts and other toys inside.
There are no downsides to this toy.
The boy we gave it to will become an actual astronaut one day and make this toy famous.
We love Green Toys.
Of the 4 or 5 we own, it seems like we like this one the best.
As soon as our 3.5 year old saw it she loved it.
It seems like its always being carried around the house and played with in whatever room she is in.
She also likes to use her other figurines to play in it as well, and she starts playing with it all over again whenever there is a spaceship on TV.It is super well made and we LOVE that its made in the USA.
It has no sharp corners and can handle banging around and we feel totally comfortable letting our 1 year old play with it as well.
It doesn't have a ton of moving parts if that's what you're looking for, but seems to get a lot more play than the cars, dump truck and submarine in our house.This rocket is the same scale as the cars, trucks and other vehicles from the line.
I cant say enough good things about this brand and their knack for making simple, safe, good toys for kids.
When I first got this toy, I was not very impressed.
It looked so plain with it's rather plain, brown cardboard packaging.
Only having two colors made it look less exciting.
I gave it to my 13 month old grandson and he immediately began playing with it.
He was more interested than I thought he would be.
When he let go of it for a bit, my 4 year old grandson and his friend started playing with it in a more creative way.
They were actually flying it all over.
They would open and close the two doors, taking the two &#34;astronauts&#34; in and out of the sections.
I thought they would get bored quickly.
But, the rocket traveled from room to room around the house via kid power.
I wasn't expecting much from this product - it looked plain to me, right down to the packaging.
But from the minute a young relative picked it up, it's been a huge hit.The toy is basically a rocket with two astronauts, but the limits for play are really limited only by the child's imagination.
The toy is made of sturdy plastic, and the top of the ship is removable to allow access to the inside.
No elaborate pieces, no buttons, and no sound effects, and this is part of the charm.An excellent product for those looking to give a toy that allows for imaginative play, instead of something with bells and whistles.
It's a nice change in a toy world dominated by electronics and technology.
So, this is a pretty simple toy with no bells, but actually some hidden whistles (check the rocket boosters out).
The kids have fun taking it apart and playing with the guys, but overall it is pretty simple.
Why does everyone like it?
It is eco-friendly.
That is the only reason.
This is a durable, eco-friendly Rocket that my grandson adores!
It is sturdy and the pieces aren't too small, but it's just so plainly designed that I have a hard time giving it five stars.
It's a cool rocket with two little astronauts, but it's not really exciting to look at.
This toy rocket doesn't light up, make noises, or teach your child music or Mandarin.
And that's a feature, not a bug.
No batteries are required for your child to have hours of imaginary - and perhaps quiet - fun.This sturdy plastic toy is made from recycled plastics which can ease your conscience about bringing one more plastic doo-dad into your home.
The two included astronaut figures are likewise sturdy and recycled, as well as being just the right size and heft for your average toddler/preschool hands.This toy isn't part of a TV show, nor is there an accompanying script.
The flight module separates from the rocket boosters and the doors on the flight module open and close.
The rest of the action will have to come from your child's imagination.
And that's a good thing.My kids (ages almost 5 and almost 7) are somewhat out of the target age for this toy, but they still enjoy flying it around the room and making up adventures for their mini astronauts.
My older daughter is learning about space in school, so it's been interesting to see that knowledge reflected in her play.
The younger one doesn't know what she's talking about - to her it's just pretend play like any other.Recommended for parents who are tired of the beeping and blipping, creativity-killing scripted toys and changing batteries.
Simple, basic, easily recyclable.This is a simple plastic rocket, top capsule pulls apart, two spacemen fit inside either one (both have doors).
Our children (1 and 3) both love putting the spacemen in and out of the capsules, and separating/attaching them.
No blinking lights, no stickers, just some good quality toys.Box was great as well, simple, recyclable and frustration free getting at the toys.
Powered by your child's imagination, blast off away from the world of fancy, battery-powered noise making toys and travel through space to a simpler time.
My kids love this thing and since it comes with 2 astronauts and the rocket can split into two, it makes sharing easy.
I really like how it helps them get their imaginations working.
I don't really care that the plastic is recycled but if that's something that matters to you, that's just one more plus.
My son really loved getting this little rocket set with doors that open and two little astronauts included.
He played with it for about ten minutes before going to get his Toy Story action figures to stuff inside as well.
Unfortunately, he is partial to Disney and Pixar (as are many kids) and could not leave Buzz Lightyear on the ground while two plain, non-brand name toys rocketed into the sky.That being said, this rocket is of high quality and doesn't seem like it will break soon.
It even looks and feels like it will stand up to strong toddler hands.
My son had just as much fun playing with this toy as he would any other rocket as soon as Buzz and Woody were on board.
This rocket has enough room for so many toys, the whole crew could fit in.
He stuffed 4-5 handfuls of toys inside the bottom compartment and the two non-Toy Story astronauts into the top.
Apparently they were the pilots.So, yes, this toy is fun and will provide hours of play for a kid not concerned by name brands.
If the name brand toys were made with this much durability, they might have some competition, but this rocket is so strong, it seems it will outlive all the Disney stuff.
For those of you worried about paint and labels for a kid who likes to put things in his mouth, this item has none and is very easy to clean inside and out.
Also perfect for a playschool or daycare where you might have to scrub it down more frequently.
"Okay, let's get it out there right away: This IS a ""green"" toy; made from recycled materials etc.
That said, it's like the 1970's attempt at generic foods (remember the white labels with black print on the cans and boxes?)
While it's admirable, the generic ""green"" approach is polarizing.
The rocket is dual colored: blue and red.
Awesome!
So are the two little astronauts - blue and red.
There are no stickers, no identifications and only two operable doors.The good: It is sturdy and appears durable for a two year old (for whom this one was purchased).
there are no tiny parts for the kid to choke on.
It looks like it can take a licking (and was during the time I was present).
This is a toy that kids have to use their imagination with.The bad: There's very little detail to the rocket - I can appreciate that there are no stickers, etc.
that the kids can choke on etc.
but some more modeling on the body of the rocket would be nice.
There is no ""landscape"" or ""backdrop"" associated with this toy - nothing that lets the kid do indoor imagining (yeah, I'm going to eat my words on this one, because when we were kids they didn't have those either - it was imagination that built the play areas).Overall, I think this is a fine toy and one that kids will enjoy - it's a shame that time and technology have even jaded me to the point where I have expectations that exceed using one's imagination.My opinion: Young kids will have a lot of fun with this, especially in the sandbox (do they still have those?)
or in the back yard."
Yet another Green Toys gem!
We love Green Toys!
I have a big collection of them now for my three year old nephew and he loves them.
Green Toys come very simply packaged.
There is no crazy plastic to wrestle, no zip ties.. just a toy and a box.
I love that!
This rocket is very sturdy and what I like to call an &#34;old school&#34; toy.
The rocket is not covered in crazy buttons and whistles.
It does not need batteries.
It's not noisy.
But kids still love it!
It's purely run on kids' imaginations, which is the way it should be.
We can't get enough of Green Toys!
First of all, the green packaging was easy to remove and dispose of - a real plus when dealing with toys.
No wires to cut or get stuck.
Opened in seconds.
The toy itself was VERY happily received by the 7 year old in the house and he played with it for hours.
The top module comes off easily with a twist when one needs a re-entry vehicle.
Both small men have a mod look to them and added to the play.
I recommend this as a birthday or Xmas present for children of both sexes and various ages.
No choking or lots of little parts to get lost.
Bright and eco-friendly!
Such a basic toy, but with room for a lot of imaginative fun.
Preschoolers will especially enjoy having this toy paired with a book likeOn the Moon.
Forget for a moment this toy is made in the USA of recycled plastic and uses no batteries, instead focus on its 100% reliance on the child to make it 'work' as intended.
Rocket sounds, narrative play, the works.
They may need a little helpful modeling from you to really know its potential, but, hey, that's quality interaction you can't put a price on.
"The way kids toss things around , durability is crucial.
However , it must be difficult to design a toy that is durable , while still being fun.The green toys rocket is such a toy.
While incredibly sturdy , it packs alot of fun into the design.
A removable top promotes eye-hand coordination and dexterity , and the addition of the ""passengers"" make the tool that much more fun.With a vivid mind , any surface can become the moon , and airspace becomes deep space , and the child is enthralled for hours."
My kids were really excited when this toy arrived.
It is made from recycled plastic and has a nice shape.
The open door and the ability to put the astronauts into the lower or upper chambers is fun.
There is only so much that kids can do with this though.
I think if we had left it in the playroom, interest would have waned.
So we moved it to the bathroom and use it as a bathtub toy and that has worked well.
While the decoration and the model is simple, the upside is that little kids won't break it.
Kids up to 6 could enjoy this, but it's ideal for a 2-3 year-old.
My 3-year-old son received this rocket for Christmas has been exploring the universe ever since.
The rocket is made of a good, solid plastic and the colors are nice and bold.
The openings (the stairwell on the bottom and the door on top) are easy to flip open and shut while also staying firmly in the position a child chooses.
The top screws off, so kids get the use of the inside of the rocket, too.My son (and his seven year-old sister) like to fly the rocket from Planet Our House to Planet Car to Planet School (where it doesn't land) and around our little &#34;universe.&#34; I love that there are astronauts included because it adds to my son's ability to enjoy playing with them (and getting someone else in the house to join him).My son has several Green Toy vehicles now, and we've found all of them to be high quality toys.
"Though I do recycle some items, I'm by no means a rabid environmentalist.
That said, this is the second Green Toys toy I've requested.
Why?
Because they are extremely solid and simple toys.
They have a bit of a throwback feel, reminiscent of the sort of toys I played with as a kid--before everything was flashing, making noise, or texting your accountant.
And they seem like they'll be around for my grandkids to play with.Plus my 3-year-old loves `em.
Sure, he would rather play with my tablet if given the chance, but when he first noticed this rocket ship he went right to it and started playing.
It warmed my heart to see him waving it in the air and making ""whooshing"" noises.
That's what childhood is all about!The packaging on these toys is second to none.
It is completely made from cardboard and is very easy to remove from the toy.
Not a strap or band to wrestle with.
Clearly a lot of thought went into every aspect of the toy, and I admire that.Get your youngster a Green Toys toy.
You won't regret it."
We are huge fans of Green Toys for toddlers and preschoolers and this toy is no exception.
It is simple but the two little astronauts and their rocket and landing capsule are quite enough for to engage any kid.
If it gets dirty or germy, it's reassuring that it's dishwasher safe.
It's made of 100% recycled plastic that is kid-safe, from a reputable company.
What more can you ask for?
The Green Toys Rocket with 2 Astronauts Play-set is well constructed with a good heft to stand up to boisterous playtime.
The overview says it's appropriate for ages 2 to 8 but I'd say the mid-range of 4 to 6 would be the most suitable age bracket.There is no set-up required; it ready to play right out of the box.
No batteries or fat instruction book needed - just your child's imagination.The data on this toy says:* Includes two astronauts* Sturdy design features detachable top capsule and flip-down doors* Encourages development of gross and fine motor skills* Made in the USA from 100 percent recycled milk jugs* Phthalate and BPA free* US supply chain reduces greenhouse gas and saves energy* Easy to clean--can even go in the dishwasherA good thing is that Green toys, made from recycled milk jugs, saves energy equal to:3000 AAA batteries.Power a TV set for 3 weeksKeep a lap running for a monthThe best part is that it's fun.
One of my kids is getting into space stuff and I thought I'd try it.
It doesn't light up or sing or even require batteries, yet he played with it for hours.
Comes with two astronauts, the door drops down, has a little vehicle set, and the top is removable.
Stores pieces in the ship.
The simplicity of this toy is amazing, yet fun.
This appears extremely durable so far.
Some of the pieces, like the astronaut, are small, but not small enough to have me worried about my two-and-a-half-year-old playing with.
I love, love, that this is made from 100% recyclable materials.
The price isn't bad for what you get either.
Recommended.
Can't go wrong with Green Toys.
This is just the latest of many Green Toys products that we own.
Although this toy hasn't been as popular with my two year old twins as some of the others, (such as the Green Toys tractor or Green Toys dumptruck) it still sees frequent play.
Like all Green Toys, this is made from recycled milk jugs, is dishwasher safe, and comes in an easy to open, recyclable box with no annoying screws, ties, etc.
The only thing that kept this toy from being a &#34;5 star&#34; toy is that when my twins put the included astronauts into the rocket, they had some difficulty getting them back out again.In conclusions, as I say in all of my Green Toys reviews, it is great finding a company that produces quality, American made toys that do not rely on &#34;bells and whistles&#34; to keep the attention of children.
My kids use their imagination when playing with these toys, and that, in my opinion, makes Green Toys worth every penny.
So the other Green Toys are great, simple car designs with fun features that are equally simple but work well with the car theme.
What I found with this toy is that the simple design doesn't  transfer so well to a theme that is decidedly high tech.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that space exploration as a theme comes pretty pre-loaded with ideas of more complex features in a toy.
It would have been nice to have a bit more detail and additional colors, heck, the Green Toys trucks and cars we have DO have more detail and colors than this toy does.It is nice to not have to worry about bad plastic or breakage, I think I could back my car over this and it would probably pop my tire.It is ok, but I would not pay retail price for this.
Wait until it is on sale if you want to give it a try ;)
My daughter and I have some difficulty getting the astronauts in and out of the ship, but other than that, this product is great.
Well constructed, sturdy, and fun.
Green toys are wonderful.
We now have a variety of cars and trucks and things that go.
The rocket is by far the most sophisticated toy of theirs.
Our toddler loves to put the astronauts in and out.
There is a lot of creative play possibilities with other toys (like Calico Critters, etc.)
Basic imaginative toy that is sturdy and made well.
Remember adventure people by fisher price?
This begins to remind me of those, though obviously less sophisticated.
Be sure to check it out!
"My 4-year old grandson plays Minecraft on his own Kindle Fire.
So when this bright red and blue rocket in a cardboard box arrived, I wasn't so sure he would be interested.
No batteries.
No remote control.
No bells and whistles.Boy was I wrong!
He loves it!First of all he could take it out of the plain, recyclable cardboard box by himself.
The durable 2-stage rocket has 2 doors that snap open and closed.
And it comes with 2 astronauts which really adds to the fun for some reason.
This is such a simple toy but it definitely sparks a child's imagination.I like the safe, recycled plastic, energy-saving toy construction.
But frankly my grandson doesn't really care that much about that.
He said, ""This is the most awesome rocket in the history of ever!""
And he's been playing with it for hours.
He will be getting more Green Toys for Christmas."
My 3 year old had been talking about he wants a rocket ship.
He loves to play with his cute little Blue and Red rocket.
The Green Toys Rocket comes with 2 astronauts.
I am scared my 3 year old won't be able to find them at some point.
He loves to play with them, but sometimes will take them and play with them with other toys.
This rocket is small enough that he can carry it around and it keeps him playing.
