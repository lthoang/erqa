Totally engaging for higher thought.
I highly recommend ANY Ravensburger puzzle.
Did I mention that it's hard?I worked on this for about 4 hours without realizing that there was a template.

Reviews:
First, in general: Ravensburger puzzles are awesome.
High quality, precision cut, nicely printed; they're a far sight better than the cheap puzzles you buy in box stores.
Puzzle enthusiasts should love Ravensburger.This puzzle specifically, thr Krypt, is not for the casual puzzle fan.
A deliberately blank puzzle, cut into a unique spiral piece pattern ... it's a times frustrating, at times mindnumbing, at times really fun.
But it's always really, really hard.
As I write this, I STILL haven't finished it, and I don't know that I ever will.
I just don't have the kind of stamina and will to complete it that some others do!
Ravensburger, to me, is top-of-the-line when it comes to the quality of their puzzles and other games.
This puzzle will last for years.
It is sturdy and there is no wondering if a piece fits or not--Each piece is cut with precision.As so many others have stated before me, this is an extremely challenging puzzle.
Obviously, if you are considering the purchase, you are looking for a challenge.
This is it!
The puzzle pieces are made of a sturdy cardboard, are fully interlocking and have a glossy silver surface.
I am pointing this out first because the pieces need to be (1) sturdy, often tried in many locations and (2) glossy, wipe off easy with a dry rag.I am going to start by saying I love puzzles.
Ok, with that said WoW...this is a challenge.
I started this puzzle 2-weeks ago and it is still unfinished ~ granted I don't work on it constantly, usually when I am cooking (hence ~ the reason I know the pieces can be wiped off with a dry rag).
I have everything outside the spiral completed (with a piece missing here and there) and about 3.5 rows of the spiral completed.My plan ~ ever evolving ~ I built the frame, and then froze...WHAT TO WORK ON NEXT?
I started sorting pieces with the help of my hubby; this occurred multiple times.
We finally decided that sorting them by the numbers of tabs and blanks was our best option.This puzzle is an on-going project; it will be concurred.
If you like puzzles join me...in my fight to complete this very challenging, often frustrating, adventure.This is a great family project (HINT: Heed the CHOKING HAZARD -- Small parts.
Not for children under 3 yrs.)
My family and I love doing puzzles and have never tired one that does not have a picture on it.
My 17 year old son wanted to tackle getting the edges together and it took him about 2 hours to do it.
You definitely have to rely solely on the shapes of the pieces to put it together.
We are till working on it a bit each day.
It is a lot of fun, and we enjoy that it is different from any other puzzle we have put together.
This has to be on of the best puzzles I've done in a really long time.
I started at the center and worked my way out.
There is a cheater sheet inside an envelope in the box (I DID NOT OPEN THIS).
I think the puzzle is more fun without knowing what shapes you are looking for.
This puzzle took weeks to finish but was worth it.
Great quality and interesting.
"---------------------------------------------------------------------Krypt Silver 654 Piece Blank Puzzle Challenge(Ravensburger)---------------------------------------------------------------------Wow - this is one difficult puzzle!
The Ravensburger ""Krypt"" jigsaw puzzle has only one color -- a matte, metallic silver-gray -- and thus there are no visual cues to help you solve the puzzle other than the shape of each individual piece.
This includes the pattern of the puzzle, which begins with a central whirlpool design, radiating outwards to the edges, which have many elongated edge pieces.
Towards the center, many pieces have curled, arcing shapes, but gradually this circular pattern evens out, although along the way many ""normal"" jigsaw shapes are incorporated into the central region.
Also along the way, many new, unusual shapes are introduced which may throw veteran puzzlers for a loop.There are two ways to tackle this puzzle - the first is to simply try muscling your way through (after meticulously sorting all 654 pieces by shape, of course) Just start somewhere and try out pieces one by one.
Or, you can ""cheat"" and use the small, xeroxed map of the completed puzzle's pattern, which shows the outline of each piece, and how they fit together.
I recommend cheating: unless you're a crazy genius savant, just going in blind and trying to do the Krypt like any other puzzle can be very, very frustrating.
Even looking at the key, you will learn a lot about doing puzzles and enjoy yourself... and still be quite challenged.
This one will really kick your butt.
(DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's media reviews)"
I thought this puzzle might be a fun thing to try on a cold or rainy day inside.
It looked like a challenge.
That part certainly turned out to be true.
I spent some time on it with my wife and we were able to put many of the pieces together.
We could have finished it, but it was too tedious for our taste.
There's no picture to it -- you have to put the pieces together based on their shape alone.
I can see how some people might enjoy it, but it just didn't turn out to be much fun for us.
"For years I had heard of people working jigsaw puzzles of one solid color, etc., but had never actually seen one until Vine offered this one for selection and review.I was immediately intrigued with this one and ordered it asap.
The moment it arrived, I opened it up and said something like ""Oh my (Gosh?)""
....er, no, that wasn't it!
Then I thought, ""Well, it's only 650 pieces.
""Well, here it is into day 3, and I have only 40-some pieces assembled so far.
Now, I have not worked absolutely steady on it, but many hours, indeed!
And, not for nothing, I see this as great progress after reading other's comments.
When others here have said that it is very difficult, take it to heart, puzzle-lover, and then buy yourself one anyway!
It's fun!
It is challenging, but it is also rewarding when you run onto a string of 5 or 6 pieces in a row and go ""Wow"" and smile!I will finish this puzzle.
I have incredible ""tunnel vision"" so can stay focused for hours at a time.
OCD, also, while a bane sometimes, helps with a task like this one (for me)!
Also, I have a very sharp visual orientation to my brain, and where directions or words do not always click in for me, visually I can always find my way through anything.
When this puzzle is done, I will mount it, mat it, and frame it...perhaps as a ""Trophy"", certainly as a conversation piece!Some hints for prospective assemblers....Work this puzzle on its own table, in an area where you are not distracted by anyone or anything...otherwise it becomes nearly impossible, and you may give up on it and never finish it, which would be sad.Sort your pieces...there is sort of a difference in color or reflectiveness on one side as you get away from the center.
Also, look sharp and you will see very helpful design elements that will become a guide for you!
Every piece will fit easily together WITHOUT any forcing.
I love puzzles but had never heard of this type of puzzle before.
The single color makes it very difficult to assemble, but gives a modern feel to a more traditional type project.
The puzzle is very challenging, even if you decide to use the included puzzle piece guide.
This puzzle is definitely not for someone who wants to sit down and finish it in a few hours on a weekend.
I started working on mine about a week ago, spending about an hour a day on it, and I have barely made a dent.
I love this puzzle, and I think it will look really cool when it's finally done (in a few months!
).
"I always have a jigsaw puzzle in the works and couldn't wait to finish the previous Ravensburger puzzle I was assembling so that I could start theKrypt Silver 654 Piece Blank Puzzle Challenge.
First of all, I am crazy about the metallic silver and appreciated not needing a high powered additional directed light to study a visual pattern other than the shape of the individual pieces.
On the second day of working on this one, I discovered a blueprint enclosed in an envelope but I refolded it and replaced it into the envelope and returned it to the box.
It was reassuring to know that it was included, but I personally chose to assemble the jigsaw puzzle on my own.
Some people like shiny puzzles and by shiny, I mean glossy.
I prefer the metallic appearance of this one and found it soothing to touch.
I had no problem connecting the pieces of the outer border, especially after realizing there is a shape pattern, with only two pieces joined incorrectly.
Once I looked very closely and made that identification, the border was done.
I then tackled the inner spiral and watched Alfred Hitchock's, ""Marnie.""
Maybe it was the movie, but I found this puzzle to flow together without many roadblocks.
As with other Ravensburger puzzles, the quality is excellent and they stand behind their products.
I recently had a puzzle that was missing a piece and the customer service representative was responsive."
Wow, what was I thinking?
Who in their right mind would choose to assemble a blank puzzle.
Me and many others!The nice thing is that this is only 654 pieces.
If it was a lot more, it would be easily discouraging.The edges were easy enough and since the puzzle has concentric circles for the middle, it makes it easier since pieces are different and odd shapes in certain areas.So the edges, the middle and some of the other pieces are in so far, about one third.
I'm finding it easier to place the oddities first since when it gets down to the standard puzzle piece in a standard size, I'm going to be easily frustrated!
[UPDATE] It took about four evenings to finish.
The kids helped from time to time and it was so cool to keep filling in areas.
It went faster the more I did because (obviously) there were less pieces to choose from.I have used the picture sheet which shows where each piece goes.
I don't feel like it is cheating because it's no different than looking at the photo that accompanies other puzzles.
The fact is that even though you can look at the shape of a piece, it doesn't mean that that piece is obvious.
There are plenty of choices that are similar in shape and appearance so it's trial and error.
I made a copy of the picture sheet so I could tick off the pieces that are placed to help me keep track of what's done and what's not.Instead of sorting these pieces by color or content, I sort by size and shape.
Which makes going through a set of similar pieces easier than continually sorting through them all.There has to be a method or you won't make progress.
And believe me, you need some piece placement to encourage you to continue!I did a puzzle a long time ago that was a black cat.
All you could discern were the eyes, nose and whiskers.
That had a higher piece count, 1,000 pieces, and as I remember, was harder than this.
This might sound like a silly thing to lead with, but let me tell you about the box!
It's the sturdiest puzzle box I've ever seen.
You know how most puzzles come in this flimsy cardboard that has paper tape on the edges that breaks the day you first open the box?
Well, this is not like that.
The entire package is made to last.
Impressive..Now the puzzle itself is really for people who have a lot of time, like puzzles, and have good visual and spatial skills.
The box looks like there is shading, but the entire puzzle is one sold color- silver.
Did I mention that it's hard?I worked on this for about 4 hours without realizing that there was a template.
Duh!
Use that.
It makes it immensely easier.
The first night I had most of the edges done and had a good start on the spiral in the center.
What makes the puzzle doable is that spiral.
Do that first.
You can tell which piece belong in the center because they are curved.
Sometimes the curve is slight, but there is a curve.
Top-notch quality.
Just one color.....what?
Must put this together with SHAPE alone.
Such a radical concept.
Totally engaging for higher thought.
I highly recommend ANY Ravensburger puzzle.
These puzzles are the gold standard of puzzles.
Have fun as a family.
Enjoy.
My grandmother's house has always had the community puzzle on the dining room table.
I think this one takes the cake.
If...and that is a big if..it gets finished anytime soon I will post a pic of the finished product.
It is one of the harder puzzles I have seen out there.
