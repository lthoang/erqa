It's a little unnerving that the back could eventually crack or break.
My son's favorite way to use the puzzle right now is for animal recognition, which is great!I really like that the puzzle is made of wood, and, more specifically, from a renewable resource.
We gave this to a friend's 18 month old.
As an adult, this puzzle was challenging to put together the first few times, but now that I can recognize how the pieces fit together, it's a lot easier.
This puzzle will last a long time and will continue to be interesting and fun as my son grows.

Adorable!
We gave this to a friend's 18 month old.
He loves it!!
So does his 5 year old sister.
The box and puzzle pieces are both made out of high quality wood and are quite durable.
They look great, feel great, has a smooth surface with no splinters to stick out!The two children love puzzles, animals, colors and learning.
They're learning their letters while putting the puzzle together as well as learning about animals.
I highly recommend it for parents, teachers and children!
My son is younger than the recommended age for this puzzle, and I think it would be too hard for most 4-year-olds, which it the lower end of the age range.
I figured I'd be able to put it together with him and he would eventually be able to put it together on his own.
As an adult, this puzzle was challenging to put together the first few times, but now that I can recognize how the pieces fit together, it's a lot easier.
My son's favorite way to use the puzzle right now is for animal recognition, which is great!I really like that the puzzle is made of wood, and, more specifically, from a renewable resource.

The puzzle is quite different from your everyday jigsaw puzzle and kids may need to be assisted the first few times to get the concept of the puzzle.
The less patient kids might not enjoy playing with this but most do.The educational value really comes from the kids guessing the animal names and using their imagination to figure out how the pieces click togetherNOTE: Contrary to what the Amazon description says, the manufacturer's recommended age is 5+ and not 4+.
4 year olds will find this overly complicated and frustrating.
"This puzzle is amazing!
To come up with an animal for each letter is creative to begin with (though they did stretch it with the X, it's not surprising that they had to), but having the pieces interlock and yet still look like animals is even more of a feat.The animals have painted details on front and back.
For example, the zebra has stripes on both sides.
An extra little touch on the octopus is that the ""O"" was made to look like his mouth.
The side that's facing down in the package has lower case letters.
Most of the animals will face to the right when on that side; to the left when reading upper case.
When assembled in lower case, the alphabet reads backwards.The animals, with just a few exceptions, can even stand on their own, so the puzzle doubles as an animal play set.
The only animals that won't stay up in a natural standing position are the dolphin, jellyfish, kangaroo, monkey, nightingale, quail, and vulture.The only thing I'm not 100% thrilled with is the wood case/frame.
The back piece is thin wood, and on the one I received it isn't attached to one shorter edge.
It's a little unnerving that the back could eventually crack or break.
The sides of the frame are nice and even have dovetail joints--it's just the wood back piece that's thin.
Thankfully, this isn't an integral part of the toy, but is the reason I docked a star on the durability rating.The whole case is unfinished wood, which could potentially get grubby pretty fast.
I put a coat of nontoxic black craft paint on it (a nice contrast to the bright animals--other than the gorilla, monkey, and vulture) to help seal it.
There was also a strong stain/paint and/or glue odor on the whole toy, but this aired out really quickly.Anyone who sees this puzzle just loves it.
I've already been asked a couple times how much it costs."
We love this puzzle.
Each puzzle piece is well made and adorable, with a lowercase letter on one side and an uppercase letter on the other side.
In order to complete the puzzle you have to match up the interlocking pieces in the correct alphabetical order and make sure the letters are all in lower or upper case.
My 3-year-old has been doing 36-60 piece puzzles on his own for a while now and the interlocking wooden animals - plus the added element of matching letter cases - provided just enough of a challenge to make him really interested in solving this puzzle set.
Unlike traditional cardboard puzzles there is also the added element of each puzzle piece being a stand alone animal toy as well.
If your child doesn't feel like doing the puzzle they can just play with the animals like they would any other wooden toy.
Overall a great set.
"Pros:- Sturdy- Non-toxic paint- Storage box comes with the puzzle- Very good design- Feature for more advanced kids: reversible design, with capital alphabet letters on one side, lower case on the otherCons:- Puzzle pieces come apart easily, you need to assemble it in the box- High priceThis is our second puzzle of this basic type -- a wooden animal puzzle with an alphabet theme.
Our other one resemblesthis Noah's Ark Puzzle.Our son is two and a half and absolutely loves both of them.
He can put them together by himself, but with this puzzle he can only do one side -- not the ""backwards"" version with the lower case letters.The advantage of the other puzzle is that the pieces fit together in a tight lock, so the assembled puzzle stays together without the box.
Other that than, this one inspires more confidence in the quality of the toy.
Pricey, but good."
