Reviews:
We have many LeapPad games and this was a great addition, if I dare say  - the favorite of all the games.
I asked my 4 and 6 year old how many stars they would give it (out of 5) they both gave it 10, lol.
This game is fun to play, albeit not very educational - it does offer some reasoning and problem solving skills.
Gameplay includes: monster matching, scaring, creating new monsters, and the kids get very excited when they find a 'scare card' which unlocks a new monster.
I admit, I played for a tad and it's kinda fun.
Give it a try!
"My daughter loves this game.
I will warn you, that it is a bit irritating at times, since one of the game choices involves a screaming child that the monster you build is ""scaring"".
I don't know that it is the most educational game Ive seen, but it is a lot of fun and I see her developing a lot of hand eye coordination and small motor skills using the stylus.
Overall, I would recommend to any Monsters Inc fans."
"This is the second Explorer game I've gotten for my 3-year-old munchkin to play with on her LeapFrog 2, and I have to say, it's yet another great game, and we simply love the whole LeapFrog system.She already has theLeapFrog Explorer Learning Game: Disney Minnie's Bow-tique Super Surprise Party, which she uses all the time, and loves.
She's also a BIG fan of the Monsters Inc movie and toys, and this software is yet another hit.There are several game options.
The one she most regularly uses (at this time, at least) is the maze.
The characters have to go through a simple (for adults) maze, snagging prizes along the way which they can use to add ""mementos"" to their ""collection"" back at the Monster U frat house.She's actually a bit young for these games, according to the age ""suggestion"", but she finds them really entertaining, and she is definitely learning from them, too.
She IS advanced for her age (EXTREMELY intelligent), but I think most kids her age will enjoy these games, and as they get older and more able to absorb the educational aspects I think they'll continue to use and enjoy them, making them a great value for the money."
"The premise of this game is very cute.
You alternate between playing as Mike & Sully to navigate through three sections with eight levels in each section.
The game is cute, but it's just kind of short.
Even if you collect every item to ""perfect"" each board, this game takes less than 2 hours to finish.
There are two mini games.
One is a matching game and one if a guess the monster game.
They are fun the first 10 times you play them, but they get old quickly.Every time you exit the game, you are forced to run the tutorials when you start up again.
Also, you collect coins in the game, but there doesn't seem to be any way to spend them.
There are two levels of difficulty, but you can only play the harder level once you have beaten the easy level.
Also, you only get ""rewards"" once.
Which is fine, except there is some kind of glitch in the game that shows you finding them on your second, third, fourth play-though.The game is really cute and pretty fun, but it feels more like a ninety-nine cents app than a full game.
Prices fluctuate, and Amazon says we are not supposed to take price into account when writing a review, but it's hard not to."
My boys love Monsters Inc. and they love their LeapPad so we of course had to get this game.
I was worried my 6.5 year old would feel it was too babyish and he hesitated at first, but then he asked for it later.
The game is full of lots of monster-filled activities.
From matching to a maze to creating your own monster, it kept my boys busy.
This game is a little different than other LeapPad games as it is a whole maze that you have to keep working through the different levels and challenges.
It is actually a little harder than other games, which is perfect for older kids.The game teaches problem solving, matching and cause and effect - perfect to keep kids on their toes.
This is the perfect game for any Monsters fans or just an older (6-7 year old) LeapFrog fan.
"With the movie coming out this summer, kids will enjoy this Monsters, Inc. game focused on Monsters University.
This is different in that there is no story book, which I wish there would have been, but the learning games are fun.There are three main sections: Games, Badges and micromods.The game section was the most interesting to my kids.
The game section has four sub-sections.1.
The fraternity house is where you can see the rewards you have collecting and the scare cards you have found.2.
The Monster Maker is cute.
You can change his appearance and even add a photo of your kid.
You can use prerecorded roars or your child can make up one himself and play it back.
My kids especially had fun with that!3.
Games that teach pairing, reasoning and problem solving.4.
Scare games with levels.
The first level is in the library of Monsters University.The badge section shows what you have earned and there are things you can get from connecting to your computer.The Micromods are bonuses that also require connecting to your computer.This game is for roughly pre-k through first grade (ages 4-7).
My three-year-old daughter seems to do pretty well at it.
It is not quite as ""educational"" as some of the other ones we have, but it is fun and easy to navigate.I think both boys and girls will enjoy this game.
Who doesn't love Sully and Mike?"
This is a great game for the Leappad system.
We have several games and most are too complicated for my son to figure out on his own or he gets frustrated with them and stops playing.
This is the first that he was able to pick up and figure out all of the games on his own and he loves them.
The is a game where you make your own monster, a game that is a maze like game, and a matching type of game which is really two games in one.
He loves all three and, as I said, able to figure all three out on his own.My only problem with the game, and this is a problem I have with a.l of the Leappad games, is that you must listen to the instructions every time you play and there is no way to skip that part.
This is another aspect that can get very frustrating, especially for a preschooler.
He keeps tapping and tapping to get to the part to play and the system makes him listen to everything.However, that aside this is definitely one of the better Leappad games and I definitely recommend it for any child that loves Mike and Sulley.
This was our first experience with a Leappad, but in the past we've owned various Leap Frog toys, the L-max system and the Tag reading system.
Overall, we've had a good experience with Leap Frog so I had high hopes for this game.
Unfortunately, it seemed like they were more interested in getting a Monsters University branded game onto the market than developing this game.
The three games, while fun, aren't really challenging or educational.
After the initial introduction, you pretty much do the same thing over and over, there's not much building upon concepts that were previously introduced.
I could see a 4, maybe 3 year old enjoying the simplicity and repetition but I can't imagine a child above 5 or so really loving this game.
We have two of the olderLeapFrog Leapster 2 Learning Game System - Greenand 11 of the various cartridge games.
I can honestly say we love each and every one of them.
I had high expectations for the Monster's U game on the LeapPad, and unfortunately I am disappointed.
The game has two problem areas for me.1) It is extremely repetitive.
The main part of the game is a series of easy mazes with obstacles and monsters to avoid and things to collect and use.
One particular level might have 3 things to teach you (tools, strategies, etc.)
but not only will it make you go through ten extremely similar mazes, and you don't ever HAVE to use any of the strategies or tools AT ALL.2) It is not educational.
The mazes are totally not challenging, even to my 3 year old.
You don't need to use any of the strategies or tools the game suggests, so why bother?
One of the small side games is a version of the classic gameGuess Who.
We love guess who and play it all the time.
The Monster's U version takes all the thinking out of it.
For example, one clue might be that the monster in question is blue.
Great, so your kid learns process of elimination by turning over the other colors.
Unfortunately the game immediately TELLS YOU to turn over the other monsters.
Your kid does not have to turn on their brain and THINK at all.
"Monsters University is another winning game title from LeapFrog.
I love the positive messages it gives throughout the game, ""I believe in you, Buddy!""
and ""Well done!
""Multiple levels of play:  the easiest levels start with things like mazes to work through - very simple mazes that will give the child some practice using the stylus, some positive reinforcement, and some success while they are going through the levels.
Even when you forget to do the task, it just reminds you to do it next time.
And of course, it lets you pick up loot along the way, an all-important part of game play.It also keeps it interesting by inserting mini games like matching cards to reveal keys and finding spitwad balls to put out candles.
Sneaking past monsters is also another fun play.This is a good game that works on reasoning skills and following directions.
Reading is a benefit, not a requirement.The LeapPad is one of those rare items that entertains everyone in the house.
It is a durable toy that takes a lot of knocking around and just keeps on ticking."
First of all let me say that the LeapPad2 is a great toy/tablet.
The Monsters University Learning Game holds the attention of my 7yo son.
That, in and of itself, earns this game 5 stars.
Most learning games don't hold the attention of their intended audience.
This game does.
It is mainly puzzles, which stimulates those wonderful brain cells and enhances problem solving.
This game is so much fun.
It is guaranteed to provide your little one with hours of fun.
You will like it just as much.
Monsters inc is a legendary movie and this game carries on the legacy!
"My kids love their Leap pads, and particularly love Monsters, Inc.
When this game came along, we knew we had to pick it up.The game essentially contains four sections.
They are:1.
Scare Games - The scare games are the main portion of the game.
This part shows an overhead view of a room (i.e.
library) and your kids have to use the stylus to create a path to obtain pennants throughout the room.
There are also additional items that can be collected.
After collecting the pennants, they need to direct the character back out the door.
These games alternate between Mike and Sulley as the characters.
It's a pretty basic game which lots of levels.
Kids can also choose between easy and difficult levels.
There are 24 levels total for this portion of the game with three areas: library, scare simulator, and the eko house.2.
Midgame Mixers - Here are two additional activities.
Monster match, which is essentially a simple card matching game.
As you obtain matches, you uncover items (such as a hat) that you can obtain and store in the Fraternity house (more on that later).
This game does have a time limit.The second activity is ""Guess the Monster.""
My 3 year-old daughter didn't really understand the game, but my six year-old son loves it.
It's recommended for ages 4-7, so I'd say that recommendation is right on.
The game consists of a number of different activities, with different levels of difficulty.
The most difficult setting is greyed out, either based on my son's age that we input, or on his experience the game, I can't tell yet.
Either way, I like that he can't accidentally choose a level that's too difficult.
He likes that when he gets bored with one activity, he can switch to another.The activities have voice prompts to help learn the game, which were very useful.
It is neither too hard nor too easy, hitting the sweet spot of playability.
There was one activity where you build your own monster, then test its scream collection ability.
It was unclear what factors go into getting more scream, but my son didn't seem to mind at all.
He keeps asking to play it, which is high praise for a kid with such a short attention span.
I will definitely be looking for similar titles in the future.
I was surprised to find out that an actual Leap Pad came with the video game.
I was more excited than my six year old was though.
He already has the Leapster GS and Explorer and I appreciated that this game can be used in either of the game systems.Unfortunately, our Leap Pad is dysfunctional.
The screen is off in its calibrations.
When you touch a place on the screen it responds in another place.
It is very frustrating and kills all desire to play the games because you have to figure out where to press.I hope I can return it for one that works.
I'll update my review at that time.
"We are pretty new to the Leap pad product, but I have to say, I'm not that impressed so far.
We've been using the Kindle Fire and pick up a lot of free apps for the Kindle and a few .99 ones for the kids and they love them.
They are very educational and easy to pick up on.
This leap pad however, seemed difficult to navigate, even for adults.
It doesn't come with much of anything, especially for 3 year olds.
There is the camera and the photo-shop, but it's pretty hard to navigate.
Anyway, this game seemed relatively easy for my 3 year old to use even though it says for 4-7 years old.
Now, an older kid would probably get a lot more out of it, but she liked navigating the halls for about 10 minutes and then suddenly wanted to stop.
I don't know if she got bored or was scared -- we've never done much ""monster"" stuff before, but we put it on the shelf and she hasn't asked to use it for 3 days now.
I checked online for the other games and prices seem to start at $10 and up... it just doesn't seem worth it.
Maybe I'll change my mind after we've used it for a for months or got a more appropriate game for a preschooler, but this doesn't seem to be a winner in our household."
We have quite a few LeapFrog games that are considered educational and 'learning' games, and I think this one sits at the bottom of the list as far as the most fun/interesting of the bunch.
My 5-year old quickly became bored with it - as did I when I gave it a try.
Sully and Mike have to work their way through a maze and pick up certain items and not get caught, and there are a few opportunities to play 'mini games' while going through the maze.
The maze does get progressively harder (slowly), but not by much - the concepts never change.
There are only 2 mini games, and they are not hard and they don't change (as far as I can tell - we've gone up to level 12 and it hasn't changed).
One of the mini games is a matching game, the other is a 'guess who' type of game where you use process of elimination to guess the monster.
You can collect little gifts during game play to decorate your room, and that's pretty much the extent of the game - it's not exciting at all.My daughter much prefers games like Mr. Pencil and I Spy that offer a lot more variety and learning - unfortunately this Monsters University game from LeapFrog does not offer much.
"I have had a lot of fun playing this with my kids, we always spend the first time playing together so I can see how to play the games and help them if they need it.
This game actually has many games on the cartridge, my two year old plays a game that is a lot like ""guess who"" with monsters.
This game lets you pick questions to ask like does this monster have one eye, or is he furry.
After eliminating monsters you get down to the last one.My four year old likes to play the longer game in which you play though levels of monster university scare games.
You have to lead your monster around the campus to pick up collections of items and coins to beat the other team.
This game can take a while so my kids sometimes quit and come back to it later.
It is lots of fun and pretty easy to pick up and play with little direction."
"I was hoping for something ""scarier"" and more engaging but instead got a bunch of mazes that are not very challenging as most of the tougher parts are optional.
My kids found the puzzles in the ""Roller Ball"" section of the ""Phineas and Ferb"" game more entertaining than this.
My 8 year old was done with it in no time.
My three year old still plays with it once in a while but not as much as with other LeapPad games."
"My daughter loves her Leap Pad and we were excited to get this game, and while she does like it, it gets old fast and she doesn't play with it for too long before moving on to something else.
There are several different games on this cartridge but they are very repetitive and there really isn't any educational value to them.The Scare games are basically mazes in which you have to collect coins (though there's no where in the game to spend them) and get through some obstacles and past a few monsters to advance.
My daughter gets bored because the mazes are exactly the same layout each time so it's extremely easy to navigate through them.
The ""Monster Maker"" is pretty boring because you don't have many options to customize the monster other than changing its growl, face, arms, and color.
She doesn't really play this one because there's no challenge to it.
The one neat thing about the ""Monster Maker"" is that you can use the Leap Pad camera to put your child's face on the monster.
That she was impressed with.The matching game is too easy for the age this game suggests of 4-7 years old.
All you have to do is tap the two pictures that match.
I think it would've been better and more challenging and really getting into the critical thinking/memory skills if they had made it a memory match game instead where the child has to flip over the cards and remember where the matches are.
The game we enjoyed the most was the ""Guess the Monster"" game because it is just like the ""Guess Who"" board game in which you are given clues and then you have to determine the one monster who fits all the clues.Overall, my daughter does like some of the games and had fun with it, but I found it to be a disappointment because I don't feel the games work much on memory skills, logic, or cause and effect skills like the product box claims so your child will be entertained but won't really learn anything from this game."
This learning game is very educational and entertaining.
I highly recommend it for ages 4-7 years old.
The LeapFrog Explorer Disney Pixar Monsters University Learning Games teaches logic skills, memory skills, cause & effect skills, and critical thinking.
If problem solving skills are high on your agenda for your kids...this is for you!
This is a generally enjoyable kids game that my little ones loved!The Monster Maker is cute for a moment when you use the LeapPad to take a picture of your child's face to put in the Monster's mouth.The main meat of the game, however, leaves Mike and Sully sneaking through the library avoiding other Monsters, blowing out candles with spitballs and collecting pennants along the way.
The main educational component comes through mini-games required to open certain doors.
The games are simple memory match, and a logic game where you pick Guess Who?-style clues to narrow down choices between several monsters (is the monster blue?
is the monster wearing glasses?
).It's a good buy, especially if your kiddos are Pixar fans!
My 7 year old loves this game!
She enjoys the mazes, decorating her own room in the frat house and most of all, designing her own monster.
Any child who likes the Monster Inc. movies will LOVE this game.
"There's not much different about this game than other games in the same category.
The same types of puzzles, challenges, graphics, etc.
The themes and activities just vary from game to game.
But there are 3 things that make this one unique and kept my 5 and 7 year old entertained for hours on a car trip.Create your own monster.
You can choose features for your own character in the games and change them later if you want to.
This was a well loved feature with my kids.
They loved being able to change their monster from day to day.Record your own monster scream.
This was probably the most fun feature.
I would say that before they started playing the game, the kids spent the first couple of days recording their own screams to hear them back on the game.
They laughed hysterically while I tried to muffle the sounds.
Do NOT give this game to your kids on a car trip if they've never played it before.Finally, I love the concept that these ""monsters"" are friends.
No more stories from my kids about something under the bed or in the closet.
They now think of these monsters as play mates."
"Although this game is rated for 4-7, I believe it is more appropriate for a slightly younger set.
My neighbor's 2.5 year old son enjoys the matching game a lot when he comes to visit - and it's totally age appropriate for him.
I would never think to offer this game to my 7 year old nephew though.
He's been playing games on his Wii since he was 5-6.
This is way too simple.
And I think that's true for most kids his age.If you keep the revised age rage in mind, this is a 5 star product.
The games are simple and fun with appropriate levels of positive feedback to keep the child engaged.
I disagree with some other reviewers who say that it's not educational.
Even just using the maze teaches problem solving.Think of this as a step up from all the various apps where babies just tap on things to make things happen.
What do you get when your toddler is old enough to know what ""same"" and ""different"" mean ..... ?
This game is perfect for that stage."
My 3 year old daughter is younger than the suggested minimum age of 4 years old for this game.
Nevertheless, after me playing it with her the first couple of times, she has now caught on to it and only occasionally asks for help.
I like that this game challenges her to use her critical reasoning and problem solving skills.
She had never watched the Monsters, Inc movie until just a few days ago.
After watching that, she is even more interested in this particular game now.
I admit, neither my 4-year-old nor I have played any LeapFrog games before this one.
I played plenty of video games in my youth, and spend perhaps too much time playing games on my phone these days, so i at least am not naive to the world of gaming.A good game teaches you how to play, building up the pieces one at a time, then sets you loose.
This game teaches you how to play, but builds up the pieces far too quickly.There are a couple different components of this game.
There's a collect-the-widgets part, where the characters are lead through very simple mazes to collect all of the pennants.
This is a pretty simple concept, but builds slowly into greater complexity - you have to avoid being seen by the bad guys, you can find bonus prizes, and so on.
There are also locked doors, and to get the key you have to play a card game, like a memory game (matching cards in pairs) or a rule-out games (rule out cards based on features, like number of eyes or color of fur).Here's the problem, though: the concept of lead-the-character-through-the-maze has only just been introduced when the match-the-cards-to-get-the-key part comes in.
Especially for younger children, this is too much, too fast.
If the game taught the maze part, then had a few simple mazes to practice, THEN brought in the memory game, it might work.
This design, with all the game modes piled on top of each other, is just confusing.
In addition, new functions are taught in the middle of the game.
When spitballs are introduced to blow out candles, there's not a mini-tutorial before the game.
No, instead the player will be halfway through a maze, land on a spitball, and the game will STOP for an explanation.
This game was not designed with any sense of flow.The flow of the game breaks all the time.
If the character finds one of the monster cards, it stops the maze game for a splash screen of the card, reminding the gamer to go look at their card collection some time.
Not now, of course, you're in the middle of a maze, so finish the maze, then... yeah.There's a subgame of building your own monster then testings its ability to scare a child.
This has nothing to do with the maze/memory game, except that you need to collect the cards from the mazes to make the scary monsters.Worst yet, there are bugs in the game.
My son just turned four years old and he loves his Leappad and the large game library he has for it.
This game, however, is not one of his favorites.
The few times he does play it, he repeatedly asks my husband and I to help him with it.
The majority of his other games are also for ages 4-7, but he doesn't need near as much help with those.
When I have helped him play it, I can see how it could be difficult for him as higher levels have you running through mazes being chased by monsters.
I found the game itself to be fun and I think it will be something he will enjoy more as he gets a bit older.
Just a heads up though if your child is four; this might be more suitable for the upper age ranges.
Let me start by stating that the 6-year old that received this game was instantly hooked on it.
It is great to see the loveable monsters from Monsters Inc. in a new game based on the sequel.
While this was inevitable, not all licensed properties live up to one's expectations.
Thankfully, that was not the case here.
The game play is just the right level of difficulty for the recommended age range.
The levels are challenging but not overly frustrating for the little ones.
The best aspect about games such as these is that kids are learning without even knowing it.
To them, they are having fun playing with some of their favorite characters in fairly easy to understand and fun activities.
The graphics are not overly impressive but again, since the game is fun, it hardly makes a difference.
The only quibble is the need to connect to the internet to download additional features of the game.
This is a re-occurring theme with LeapFrog and even Innotab games that simply is unnecessary.
It is just an excuse to get users to create an account with the company website where one will be enticed into making additional purchases.
A shameless marketing ploy that undermines the value of the games, in this reviewer's opinion.
Overall, this is a fun game that should keep the little ones entertained for quite some time.
"This is actually a fun and fairly well-made game for kids.
If your child or children liked the Monsters Inc. Pixar movie, they'll probably be into this.
My only recommendation would be hop on YouTube and watch a gameplay video there (just search for the product name) to make sure it's the right age range for your child.
Leapfrog bills this as 4-7 years old, which is a HUGE range in terms of development already, and that doesn't take into account the individual child's style and ability.
My child is almost 6 and played with it for quite a while, but he has a lot of experience with other educational games and decided this one was too easy and ""boring"" after a short while compared to some of the iPad games he's used to.
I've seen parents complain this is way too easy for their 7 year old and others that it was confusing for their 4 year old.
It all depends on your child's age and personality, so peek at a video before you commit.
If you think it may be too hard now, it's a good way to introduce your child to something that can grow with them, but if you even suspect it might be too easy already, it probably will turn out to be a waste of money."
While yes, I am an adult, I did totally try playing this game and found it to be very easy, albeit very interesting.
I do have almost eight years of experience working with children so I feel very confident saying that most kids who are 5 and up will enjoy this game.
While LeapFrog says this game is for kids as young as 4 or in PreK, they might find the game a bit challenging.
Not to say that they won't like it, but they could be asking you for help a lot and if you're giving this game to your child to play to keep them out of your hair for a while this might not be the ticket unless they're a little older or a little bit more experienced at gaming.I do love, love, LOVE that this game really does incorporate a lot of critical thinking skills.
As a tutor it's definitely an area that many kids are lacking in as it's not something specifically taught in many schools.If your kid enjoys the LeapPad2 and is looking for a new game this is definitely worth checking out.
I love Monsters Inc. and with the new movie coming out this summer I can totally see a lot of kids clamoring to get this game :)
