Reviews:
I let my cousin's three kids play with this toy when they come over, and they all really enjoy it.
The entire design is highly interactive,  You can choose from eight instruments, and kids aren't just learning different styles of music, but also numbers and colors.
All the while, the balls that pop up when each button is pushed keeps kids engaged and entertained.
I give LeapFrog high marks for this one.
Nearly the perfect balance of fun to educational value.
"My 19 month old child has not stopped playing with this toy since we received it from Amazon (Vine).
He has a few other LeapFrog items, but he has never taken to one like he has this.
He really enjoys music, and has been learning his colors, so this seemed like an easy choice.There are 4 basic modes:Number: Press a key, number ""sung"" (1-8, in the tone of a scale)Color:  The color of the key ""sung""Free Play: Each key becomes a different instrumentSong: The piano plays a song; kids can choose to accompany by pressing other keysWhat my child loves: watching the balls go up.
He likes the songs and has had a lot of fun just playing random keys.
The switch to move from counting to colors to free play is easy for him to manipulate.What I like: the tonality is pretty good for a kids' toy.
And because it follows the scale, you can play some actual songs on it.
I also like that it doesn't have anything to break off or keep stored with it, as many of the child xylophones do.However, I find it a little loud.
It comes with a volume switch, but even the ""low"" setting is loud.
I also wish that it counted higher than 8 (he can already count to 8).That limits its educational value.
It does start to get annoying when they push the same button over and over, especially in counting mode.
""Eeeeiiiight!
Eeeeiiiight!
Eeeeeeight!
Eeeeeeight!
Eeeeeeight!""
etc.Remember the 90's Sampsonite commercial where they have a gorilla in a room with a suitcase?
This Poppin Play Piano is pretty cute!
It has 4 modes of play.
In the first mode your child presses the keys and learns the numbers 1-8.
The second mode teaches the colors of the keys, and the third mode allows your child to choose an instrument and each key makes a note like that instrument.
Finally the last mode plays songs, one song for each key pressed.The big appeal of this toy, I think, is that when each key is pressed, the corresponding colored ball pops up in the back of the toy.
It's compelling for little ones to watch.The only negative thing I can say is that you have to press pretty hard to get the ball to pop up to the top.
So timid little ones without a lot of finger strength will have difficulty getting it to pop up.
But if your little guy loves to pound on things this would work perfectly!!
Recommended toy.
:)**I came back to edit this review and add that this toy broke after only a couple of months of average use.
It's disappointing because my daughter really loved it.
**
We have found with our 2 year old that less is more and also in many ways older is better.
We are becoming much more selective on electronic toys and are gravitating much more to 'imaginative toys': wooden toys, dolls, blocks, puzzles.
But music is very important to our daughter.
She gets a lot of joy from it and it can be very educational.
I am highly recommending this product as a great value, very educational, and for something to put high on your holiday shopping list.
Here is why.It does have a large age range.
I do think our daughter would have enjoyed this around 12 months.
She would have liked to use the keys and see the balls rise.
She would have liked the sounds.
And at almost 26 months now she enjoys it now.
Why?
Well still for the sounds and the balls but the Play Piano does so much more.
There is a numbers mode that she responds to and enjoys counting along.
There is also a colors mode.
I didn't know this but colors are actually a challenge at this age.
We have been pointing them out for a long time, but they aren't really sticking yet.
"LeepFrog has done it again with this toy recommended for ages 12 months to 36 months.
As there are no small detachable parts that are choking hazards, I would let my 9 month old push some buttons too.Like I said, it's sturdy and safe.
This thing would take a hammer to break and you'd have to try really hard.
It's drool proff as well, covered in plastic.
The keys are big enough that they won't get jammed either.The balls are a big hit.
What baby doesn't love pushing a button that sends a ball up and down?
My baby is truly fascinated with this power he has at his fingertips.
What delight!Good news is, he'll tinker with it for a good half hour before moving on, giving me enough time to clean up the playroom or catch up with my DVR showing of ""The Middle.""
Just have to listen to my show above the noise of the toy:)Speaking of - it's pretty loud.
There are two settings: Loud and louder.
BUT that's what babies like so I'm okay with it.
You can always put it up in the closet if you don't want to listen to it that day.
What you will hear are things like, ""4.
Let's count to four.

I've been a big fan of Leapfrog toys for a while now.
I love that they are not only fun, colorful and interactive, but they also teach things in a way that kids love...they learn without even realizing it through play.This little toy gives you a lot of bang for the buck in my opinion, and it's relatively small which is a big bonus since I live in a small space that is already overrun with toys.Things that I like about it:*It has several different learning modes and two volume levels (though there isn't a huge difference between them)It's easy to clean.
* I like that the child can press the keys soft, or hard and the balls will elevate accordingly teaching cause/effect* The songs are fun*It will help reinforce teaching numbers, colors and has not only piano sounds but also other instrumental and silly soundsI've learned to trust the Oppenheim Toy Gold Award toys.
I've never been disappointed in their picks.
I would buy this with confidence and I think it is worth every penny of the SRP of $24.99.
My daughter loves this toy, especially the zany sounds.
The counting and color features are great for kids under 3 who are learning all those basics.
She hasn't quite mastered the position of the switch and keys to get to exactly where she wants, sound-wise, but this is good memory building practice I suppose.
The part where she gets frustrated is also frustrating for parents.The little color balls are a neat idea but don't pop like I was hoping.
Also the plastic feels kind of flimsy and scuffs easily.
The overall quality of the toy feels a little cheap, but what would you expect for under twenty bucks?
What I love most about this toy is the fact that the piano sounds more realistic that any other baby piano toy I have encountered.
My daughter also has the Baby Einstein Count and Compose Piano and she used to love it.
However, not only is the sound more realistic in the LeapFrog version, but she prefers this one hands down now.
She doesn't play with the Baby Einstein anymore.
Maybe it's the fact that the LeapFrog is more interesting, with the colorful balls moving every time a key is hit, or maybe it's just the fact that she has been using the Baby Einstein piano longer and has become bored with it.
I personally prefer the sound of the LeapFrog because it sounds a lot like our real piano and I think my baby recognizes that.
There are many colors, not just primary colors that many baby toys exhibit and that become very boring after a while.
This is one of my daughter's favorite toys right now (12 months old), along with the Rocktivity Music Skool Table and her  Sesame Street Talking Abby Cadabby.
I love that it keeps her preoccupied, which parents need every once in a while.
This is a great toy for the younger children, as soon as they are able to control the movement of their hands until about 4 years old.
The younger kids like to listen and watch the balls move when they hit a key.
The older kids are able to learn colors and numbers while they play.
LeapFrog makes good products that help kids learn even when they don't realize it.
I have yet to find one of their products I don't like, or that the kids don't like.
This little gizmo is so cool...my husband and I have enjoyed playing with my 9 month old neice and this toy...I like how the parent has so many settings to give the child different challenges...really cool
We got this piano for my 6 month old son.
He loves to press the keys and watch the balls pop.
You can learn colors and numbers depending on the mode you select.
My 3 year old daughter enjoys the music mode where you can play along with a tune.
And the nice thing for us adults is that it's not particularly annoying, as musical instruments could be.
We definitely recommend this and it's a nice complement to the LeapFrog Maracas and Drum that we already have.
We'll have our own little band soon :)
This is a great toy for kids to build their motor skills, be educated in numbers and music, as well as visual stimulation.
There are a variety of educational modes such as counting drills.
Motor skills are developed through a match the key/color exercise.
There are many songs and sounds to keep kids engaged for hours upon hours.
Awesome product.
The thing I love about leapfrog toys is how long lasting they are in durability and in interest level for kids as they grow.
This toy would be as fun for a 6 month old as it is for a 3 year old.
A baby would enjoy hitting the buttons, watching the balls bounce and hearing the music.
An older child would enjoy composing their own songs with this little piano.
As usual in a leapfrog toy the opportunities for learning are endless.
There are music, colors, numbers and song settings providing many opportunities for learning.
While this toy is listed at 1 and up I would absolutely give this to a 6 month old.
They would have fun hitting the keys and it will be a long lasting toy.
We love this toy in our house!
The Leap Frog Poppin' Play Piano is something that every 12 to 36 month old child will enjoy.
Even our older kids like to play with it.
Not only is it educational, but it's great fun too.
The well made toy is easy and fun to play with.
It's very colorful and and also durable.
It helps develop user skills.
It's reasonably priced, and kids of all ages will like it.
We found it very useful for teaching children how to count, learning motor skills and sounds.
It's a winner.
"This toy is a hit in our house.
We have children ranging from teenagers to toddlers and everyone, I mean everyone, plays with this toy.
It is somewhat comical.
The keys are nice and bright and easy to press.
It makes a great sound and the balls pop up with every note.
We are very happy with this little piano and would highly recommend it.
We are not usually fans of ""electronic"" gadget toys, but this one has us hooked."
This is a solid toy with lots of options to spur your child's musical interest, and to assist in his or her learning of colors and numbers.For me it was a bit of a disappointment, though.
I was hoping it would be something that my two-year-old would take to, especially during those times when I'm working with his older siblings (ages seven and six) on their actual piano.Didn't work out that way, though.In fact, I think the older two have spent more time with it--mostly in exploring the different songs it will play.
Part of the two-year-old's indifference might be because we already have other piano-like toys in the house, and the Poppin' Play Piano isn't different enough to make it interesting.This piano is the smallest and feature-rich of the lot, though.
Easy for a little person to tote around.So, if this is your first piano toy to buy, it is doubtless a winner.
But if you have other such toys in the house, I'd stick with what you have.Each child is different, of course.
Your results may vary.
"This is the cutest toy ""piano"" yet!
When you push the keys a little ball pops up in a tube on the top.
The keys are all different colors and each have a different number on them (1-8).
The balls are the same color as the corresponding key.
You can set the toy to Low or High according to your preference and leave it on.
The sound stops after a minute of inactivity but can be reactivated by pressing any button on the keyboard.
There are 4 different modes:  Numbers/Counting, Music, Creativity and Colors.
This is a great way to learn numbers and colors and also to learn some fun preschool songs.
Our littlest one loves this.
She doesn't have enough language to learn the songs or colors or numbers yet but she loves the ""action"" and the sounds.
Our older preschooler is able to repeat the learning elements and purely loves the songs.
This is a great toy for learning and just plain enjoyment!."
"This is good musical toy for young kids.
It has numbers, songs, instruments and popping balls.My 22 months old son seems to like it.
He likes to switch different modes and watch what happens.The toy has 2 volume settings and max one is a bit too loud for me.
Also It would be better if the numbers would be to 10 instead of 8.The is a kids voice that sings the numbers, and I think it would be cool if he could also perform the major scale ""do re mi fa so la si do""- so kids could learn even more.But overall good musical toy, looks durable and is fun and educational in one."
"The piano is of decent quality, and will probably last through child use/play.The colors are white and the keys are clearly marked by their vibrant colors.Depends on how hard the child strikes the keys the little ball will ""pop"" hence the name ""poppin' play piano"".It seems like the child would have to strike the keys hard to get them all the way to the top.It has several different settings (colors, numbers, songs) to ""teach"" the kid.Given its bright colors it does call to their attention, but as is common with these toys, sometimes the sound output is below par, and makes it hard to understand some things.Given the variety of setting, the decent quality and the potential to help learn colors, I would probably recommend it.
Though more for ages 18+ or closer to 2 years old than those just turning 1."
I've come to realize there's not many Leapfrog products I won't try.
The kids love them, they're durable, usually easy to clean, and they learn something.I found the benefit to this toy in particular was actally seeing the ball move when the keys are pushed, not just a sound or voice.
There's 4 basic settings.
Push the number, it sings in the tone scale, sings the color, free play with a number of instrument sounds, or have it play for you with key pushing accompany.
Easy to clean and so far very durable.Downside: cost is a bit high, and it is loud.
The Leap Frog Poppin Play piano has been a huge hit with a curious 7 month old around here.Although the product is targeted for the (12) to (36) month age group honestly, I think a child older than (18) months might grow tired of this one, but don't get me wrong it's a terrific product, and here's why:*(4) different play modes which teaches the very youngest things like: counting from 1-8 (not sure why it wasn't to 10 though?
another mode teaches colors when pressing the keys, another mode teaches different instrument sounds, and the last mode plays a different song when each key is pressed*The toy is very well made and very safe - no need to worry about tiny fingers getting stuck or small part coming lose either.
*There are (2) different volume settings; I am noise sensitive and think the second setting is plenty loud.
The first setting to me was piercing - we avoid that setting.
The keys are easy for even the 7 month old to press, although it take a harder push to get the balls to pop to the topOverall, as with just about all LeapFrog products this toy is stimulating and a great value at $20.00
It was a bit too juvenile for our 3 and a half year old.
He grew bored with it quickly, after all he can already count to twenty on his own.
It's colorful, durable, and has multiple musical settings.
Being a good cousin our child  gave it to a younger relative who enjoys it immensely.
This Piano is classic in function (every baby needs a little piano), indestructible, fun, bright colors, easy to carry around, easy to figure out, and has enough going on to maintain interest.
It has enough to keep a 6 month old happy without being too babyish for a 5 year old.
It sneaks in some learning (colors, numbers) without it being too heavy handed.
Overall, I can't think of a single thing wrong with this toy.
I love it for my daughter and she loves it.
She lays on her boppy (tummy time) and plays with this, and that keeps her entertained for a good 15 minutes.Yes, the balls pop up, and that delights babies (including my 5 month old daughter), but not in an obnoxious way that a 5 year old will think is babyish.
And the settings that make it appropriate for an older child are in the background for a baby.
So it really will grow with your child.
The LeapFrog Poppin' Play Piano is a fresh take on the children's play piano.
Recommended for children ages 12 months (1yr) and up.
The Poppin' Play Piano Features all revolve around the number 8.
There are 8 preschool songs, 8 Different Instrument Choices.
It also helps teaches your child the numbers 1 through 8, as well as features 8 bright colors, with 8 cute little balls that pop up each time your child hits the keys.
I think Leapfrog have done a creative job reinventing the basic children's piano, my only dislike is I wish it was 1-10 instead of of 8 as that seams to be more common sense.
Other than that it's a fun toy and my 2yr old son adores it.
My youngest child as of 2012 is 2.
When I received this toy, I thought he would enjoy it at least.
He played with it for about 10 to 15 minutes and was done.
The toy is very basic.
It is a small keyboard with the various colors.
The color of the keys are matched with a small ball that goes up when the key is pressed.
The toy has four different settings for colors, numbers, and two settings for music.
My child does need to learn his colors better which is why I got the toy in the first place.Overall, this toy perhaps would be better for an even younger child than 2.
My little boy didn't play with the toy long and now the toy sits on top of the other toys in his toy room.
Our 16 month old loves this piano.
It is small enough to fit on a child's lap (or use in a car) yet is colorful and interactive enough to hold the child's attention for some time.
This piano counts, says the colors, and plays music and various sounds (powered by 3 AA batteries).
A little ball goes up when one of the 8 keys is pushed.
Most little kids might not understand all the options of the toy (i.e.
how to change the instrument sounds), but overall it is one of our child's favorite toys.
The Poppin' Play Piano won the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio 2012 gold medal winner for good reason.
The colorful balls, jumping to the push of a key delighted my pre-school niece the minute she laid hands on it.
It works by pressing a piano keys to make a  corresponding colored ball pop up.
This is a great way for children to learn about primary colors, music, and numbers (1-8).
The Poppin' Play Piano features 8 tunes (typical nursery rhymes such as Pop Goes the Weasel and A-Tisket, A-Tasktet), 4 learning modes (Music, Colors, Numbers and Songs) and more than 30 different fun interactions.
The Poppin' Play Piano with creative play and self-expression through music.
The action of pushing the colorful buttons helps to strengthen fine motor skills.
As children listen to the 8 included preschool tunes, they can count and sing along.
In Number mode, keys respond to touch by singing (and counting out) each key's number.
There is a particularly fun music mode that allows the child to experiment with popping keys to create their own brand of music.
This kept my niece occupied for a good while and she continues to come back to it everyday as a favorite toy.
The LeapFrog Poppin' Piano is another great LeapFrog product and the toy functions exactly as the description claims and the toy looks exactly as the picture shows.
There is a sliding bar wherein the user can decide whether to focus on colors, numbers, songs, or musical sounds.
Although the box for the product advertises that the toy is most appropriate forg ages 12-36 months, it can probably be enjoyed by kids up to 48 months since the music options are more advanced concepts.
Kids liked the variety of options, as it kept the toy from becoming boring after a few minutes.While the toy may be very fun and educational for the parents, it could be found a bit annoying by parents.
The toy makes many loud noises, which may be one reason why kids really like it.
But I found the noises to become very annoying after only a short while.
The toy's sound can be turned off, but it is doubtful that any child who knows how to use the toy will allow the parent to keep the sound off for very long.
Also, the learning part of the toy would be lost if the sound is muted.
The toddler who tested this product is satisfied, I can tell you that.
The educational value of this toy is hard to estimate at the moment, but the kid seems to enjoy all the toy's features: 1 to 8 count (why it stops at 8 though?
), 8 colors (again, why not just 7 rainbow colors?
), 8 songs and just general ability to bang on the key and produce sound and watch the balls go up and down.
The durability is still in question.
Overall, it keeps a child occupied and entertained.
