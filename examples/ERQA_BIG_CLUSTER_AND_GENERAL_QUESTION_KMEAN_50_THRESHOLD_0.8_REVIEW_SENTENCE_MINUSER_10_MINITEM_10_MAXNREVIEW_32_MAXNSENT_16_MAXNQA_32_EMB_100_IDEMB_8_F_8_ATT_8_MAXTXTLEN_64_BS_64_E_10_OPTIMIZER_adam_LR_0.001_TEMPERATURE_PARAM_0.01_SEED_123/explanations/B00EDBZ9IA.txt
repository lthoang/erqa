Reviews:
I have to admit that when I first read the back of the box and saw the sample cards shown, I had a feeling that this was going to be one of those flop games that proved to be a good idea poorly constructed, but this was a lot of fun!
The whole family enjoyed this, and that&#8217;s a rarity.
It&#8217;s a game that can skew young or old (as well as morally questionable) depending on the group you&#8217;re playing with, which makes this kind of universal.
We played this with my parents and it was acceptable and a lot of fun, and then played it with some friends where things were a tad&#8230;spicier.
Gameplay is easy enough, although we continued to forget about collecting points for NOT being pointed at, which caused the gameplay to last quite a while (no one was getting points!).
The foam fingers are funny, although they get uncomfortable after a while.
Overall, I&#8217;m really happy with this game and recommend you give it a shot.
This game takes a bit of set up time to make your truth meters.
I would have preferred they came already put together and not had to snap the little plastic fingers in.
Mainly because there were little pieces of plastic popping off which are choking hazards for little kids (not to play game, but live in the house).Once you are set up, three to six players can play at a time.
The box says for ages 12 and up, but I think a 9 or 10 year old would be able to play just fine.
There was nothing inappropriate in the game I thought for the you get ones, although they may not grasp the truth meeter concept.The cards and questions are the best part of the game for me.
They're two types of cards.
1 is the Have you Ever cards and 2 is the Would you Ever cards.
Each card has three options on it, so you get you bang for your buck out of each card.The questions are fun such as have you ever stolen shampoos off a maids cart in a hotel?
Have you ever ditched school to go shopping?
Would you go to a nude beach?My son (12 years old) thought the game was hilarious, but after a while we just played with the cards and talked instead of using the truth meters and keeping score.I do like the game and plan to use it in our social skills classes at work.
It has fun questions that the kids enjoy and it makes them think.
They'll like the foam finger pointers and yes they will poke each other and try to pick their noses with them, etc.
they're not necessary, but add to the games theme.
The spinners and strategy of the game will come second to the questions, but you may hold their attention for a while.
Probably through one game, but don't count on a second in one sitting.We will play again.
I will probably receive backlash for this review, and I will no doubt be thought extreme by some, but I'm afraid this game is going in the trash.Fun is fun, but a huge percentage of the questions in this game (both &#34;have you ever&#34; and &#34;would you ever&#34;) are simply disgusting.
Questions about farting in different places, things done while sitting on the toilet, things coming out of one's mouth or nose including snot or vomit...
I'm sorry but these are things I try to get my kids NOT to discuss, let alone playing a game that encourages this kind of conversation, or gives kids ideas about crude or even cruel things to do (for example, &#34;have you ever intentionally fed meat to a vegetarian?&#34;).Some of the questions are clever and/or offer food for thought and might spark interesting discussions, but I would have to weed out so many cards to make this game playable in my household that it's just not worth it.
We played this in a family group ages 8-67 a few weeks ago and NO ONE has asked to play it again.
The concept is fine, not really new, but the game play is slightly complicated for what should be a simple game.
I recommend using it as an icebreaker with no score keeping to keep it simpler.
Trying to figure out the scores kills the impetus of the game.That said, some of the questions are fun, but most border on the not-fun-silly and even banal.
They didn't really spark the conversation and fun revelations hoped for.
And the wording can complicate who you pick as the most likely culprit.
Parsing the question and what it really means doesn't seem like it would happen at first, but it does.
Many of the questions are better for an older crowd but the game itself would be more successful with younger kids if the questions were geared that direction.Also, be prepared to spend a good half hour putting the game pieces together before you play the first time.
There's a lot of cardboard and somewhat complicated assembly--I could have had help but once I figured out the process of assembling the meters, it was faster to do the rest than explain their assembly.
I had to pull apart the first one a few times to get it all right.
This game is a ton of fun.
It requires some initial set up, building the truth meters, the first time you play.
I also think that the age of 12 and up is a little off.
We played with my 10 year old daughter and she was able to play the game just fine.
Some of the questions wouldn't work, but we all knew that going into it, and each card has a choice of 3 questions, so you can always skip a question and select one of the others if it doesn't apply.We really enjoyed playing the game and had a blast, laughing, etc.
I would recommend this game.
If you have a large group of people who know each other pretty well, this is a really fun game to play.
If you have a small group or a group of people who don't know each other very well, this might not be as fun to play.
One person chooses a topic like, &#34;Have you ever caused the police or fire department to show up?&#34;.
Then, everyone else chooses the likelihood that they have done it and then points (with a big green finger) at who they think most likely has around the group.
If you have someone in your group that has done a lot of crazy stuff, it can get really funny.
Overall, it's a fun game to relax and have fun-not a lot of thinking involved!
This is a good game for getting to know your friends/family better.
And even getting to know what they think of you!
It's good for a few laughs and helps to lighten the mood -- adding a few drinks doesn't hurt ;-)Be sure to plan ahead of time before playing.
It takes a good twenty minutes or so to assemble the pieces.
You have to pop things out of cardboard and plastic inserts, then fold and snap them together.
Just keep in mind that if you want to play with more than six players, you'll need to purchase an additional set.p.s.
rated for players 12+
This game has 2 kinds of cards:  &#34;Did you ever?&#34; and &#34;Would you ever?&#34;  This is most fun with a group of 6 but can be played with less.
There are 6 foam fingers and truth meters etc.
in the box so you have to improvise to play with more.
When you draw a card there are 3 questions on it.
You pick the one you want and read it aloud.
For instance:  &#34;Would you ever pretend you were injured to get a better seat.&#34;  Everyone secretly sets their truth meter to their answer then points their foam finger at the person most likely to have answered &#34;Yes!
Always.&#34;  The person with the most fingers pointing at them reveal their answer first and then everyone else does.
Depending on what answer the person chose, the people pointing at them get a certain number of points.
These questions can generate a lot of funny stories.
All the pieces are well made and there are lots of great scenarios on the cards.
This is definitely a great game night game for a bunch of friends getting together to have fun.
The Pointing Fingers game is perfect for my kids.
They love pointing an accusing finger at each other, and now they can without being a narc.
Each game comes with six silly foam fingers, six truth meters, and one hundred cards with silly questions like &#34;Have you ever walked in your sleep&#34; or &#34;Did you ever talk your way out of trouble.&#34; Each person reads the question and decides just how often they've done this funny thing.
Then they answer truthfully on the meter, hiding the answer from the other players.
Once this is done, everyone guesses who they think may have done this thing the most, and points the foam finger at them for effect.
Whoever has the most correct guesses at the end of the game in the winner.Pointing Fingers is a fun game for the whole family that encourages you to spend time together and  get to know each other better.
I even learned a few things I didn't know about my husband.
The questions are all innocent and humorous.
My kids had a lot of fun playing it with us and are looking forward to trying it out with their friends as well.
The box states twelve and up, but my nine year old had no trouble playing this game.
Honestly, I think much older than twelve and kids will start to lose interest.
My thirteen year old played with us, but it was grudgingly.
The nine and eleven year old kids enjoyed it a lot more.
Pointing Fingers is a fun game for younger players in which you have several cards that ask &#8220;Have you ever .
.
.
?&#8221; or &#8220;Would you ever .
.
.
?&#8221;  I played this game with my adult son, two friends, my daughter-in-law, and my granddaughter.
We played three rounds of this game and had a good time sharing our stories and learning more about one another.
There was some laughter and silliness along with the revelations which is, no doubt, the goal of this game.It says it&#8217;s for ages 12+ but some of the questions, although never outright inappropriate for younger players, are not completely appropriate either.
For instance:  Have you ever napped at work?
Yes, each card comes with three choices so you don&#8217;t necessarily have to choose that particular one but this does limit the playing ability of this game.
Other questions parents may find inappropriate simply because acts of dishonesty or even theft are part of the have/would questions.
I&#8217;m not sure I would have wanted to ask my young children if they would pretend to find a bug in their lunch to score a free meal or take something from a &#8220;lost and found&#8221; that wasn&#8217;t theirs.
It would feel awkward.Also, the game would become predictable eventually, especially with the same group of people playing together.
Once everyone has shared how they would answer a specific question and shared their stories (the &#8220;have you ever&#8221; cards lend themselves to this) or explanations (and the &#8220;would you ever&#8221; cards definitely encourage this), it is inevitable that the same players would know who to point to maximize points and win the game more quickly.
For this reason, it won&#8217;t be a permanent fixture in your gameboard collection but it&#8217;s definitely fun while it lasts.
I'm getting a little worn out on trying new games.
They seem to sound fun, but end up being boring.
Or maybe I've just gotten too old for this.
I don't think so as the old board games are still fun.Anyway, I played this with kids aged 5, 7 and 9.
There was a lot of &#34;What are the rules again?&#34; moments, which is to be expected of a new game, but this seemed to just not ever get into a good flow.
It could have been more fun if the questions were better.
The kids ultimately started making up their own questions to things they either knew the answer to or that they'd done.
So, it was more like a tattle tale session.
The foam fingers were a good incentive to keep playing.
They liked pointing fingers at people.I am not sure how often this will get played as I don't see it being fun once you have answered the questions.
If you have a lot of games like we do, this is probably one to skip.
Pointing Fingers is an ask and answer style game that is recommended for 3-6 people.
It is definitely more fun with more than 3 people!What you get: 6 foam fingers6 &#34;truth meters&#34;about 100 question cards consisting of 2 categories &#34;have you ever&#34; and &#34;would you ever&#34;So game play goes like this;Everyone puts a finger on and promises to tell the truth.
One player draws a card and reads 1 question from a choice of 3.
After the question is read, all players choose an answer, either 0=never 1=once 2=sometimes or 3=always.
After everyone answers, the player who read the question counts to 3 and all players point to the person who they think answered with the highest number.
The person who has the most fingers pointed at them turns their &#34;truth meter&#34; first so all can see.
Then everyone turns the meters around, and if you are right and your finger pointed to the person with the highest number, you add that number to your score.
First player to 21 wins.Once everyone gets into the game, or if the players are over 21 and have a cocktail, it is a lot of fun and a neat way to get to know people a little better.
I feel it is best suited to people over 14, younger kids might not appreciate it.We had a lot of fun playing it with family, even those not really participating got a kick out of observing and putting their 2 cents in!
