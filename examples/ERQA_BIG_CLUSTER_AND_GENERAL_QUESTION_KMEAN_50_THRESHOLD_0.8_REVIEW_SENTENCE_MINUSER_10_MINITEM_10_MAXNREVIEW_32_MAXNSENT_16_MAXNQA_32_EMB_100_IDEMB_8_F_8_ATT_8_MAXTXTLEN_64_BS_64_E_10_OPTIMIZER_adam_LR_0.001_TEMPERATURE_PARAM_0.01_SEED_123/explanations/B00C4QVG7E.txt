The package comes with a card that you can slide into a slot near the handle of the sword.

Reviews:
This Power Rangers Ultra Dragon sword is the American version of the Gosei Tensword that's from the show, with the main differences being the dragon's head at the base of the sword (instead of a ball design) and the size and color of the blade.The Dragon Sword makes a couple sounds when you press the activation button, and you can make the dragon's head spin around and his eyes light up green.
The eyes are the only thing that does light up on this sword.This Ultra Dragon Sword comes with a Red Ultra Mega Fore Ranger Power Card.
If you have/buy thePower Rangers Megaforce Deluxe Gosei Morpher, the card that comes with this sword slides into it.
You can then attach the Gosei Morpher to this Dragon Sword and you get access to different sounds the sword can make.
However you don't need to have the Gosei Morpher to play with the Dragon Sword.The Megaforce Ultra Dragon Sword is a fun toy for kids or a nice collectors piece for Power Ranger fans.
My kids like anything Power Rangers, so there was no surprise they would like this Power Rangers Sword.
This sword only says probably three things over and over, which to an adult may get old pretty quickly but kids apparently don't mind too much (at least mine don't).
There are two trigger on the handle that makes the bottom part spin and makes sounds.
The package comes with a card that you can slide into a slot near the handle of the sword.
It seems that when you have the card in, the sounds that come out of the sword when you press the trigger are different.
This sword would be well suited for the young Power Rangers fan.
Our kids have played with similar toys for years and a lot of the time one of them will get hurt by it while they are playing.
Then they will get into an argument about it.
This sword has a soft rubber blade on one end which couldn't really hurt you.
On the other end there is a dragon head with a soft rubber part sticking out further than the nose of the dragon.
Yes kids will find a way to get hurt on anything but there is a lot less chance of getting hurt with this sword when compared to many other swords.
You can spin the dragon head and it lights up and makes noises.
The sword is really loud so the young ones will probably love it but it will likely annoy the parents in time.
It makes the same couple sounds over and over again.
It feels well balanced when you hold it and it should be pretty durable as well.
I grew up watching Power Rangers and I loved it.
This is an awesome Dragon Sword and any Power Ranger fan will love it.
You hit the button on the sword and the zord spins, and has lights and sounds.
This is the 20th anniversary of the Power Rangers in America, which is incredible.
This toy is more for kids around 5 years and older.
It is light and feels pretty durable.
There is not a lot of detail on the sword, but it is made for kids after all.
I admit though, this one is for me.
:-)
"The Power Rangers Deluxe Ultra Dragon Sword is an ultra-awesome role-playing toy for the real Power Rangers fan.
There are two different modes that are activated by trigger-like buttons.
One is the Standard Mode and the other is the Ultra.
If you hold down either one of the buttons for a few seconds you'll hear the Megaforce theme song.
""Me!-Ga!-Force!
Power Rangers Megaforce!
""When you press the button for the Ultra Mode, the Dragon Head (Zord) will spin around and it's eyes will light up.
Swish, swish!
You'll also hear those sword sounds.
When you are in the Standard Mode the Dragon Head (Zord) will not move, but it's eyes will light up and you'll hear other sounds.ThePower Rangers Megaforce Deluxe Gosei Morpher, that will give you more sounds is sold separately.
A Power Ranger's card is included that will slip into the slot to enable sound if you don't have the Morpher.
The sword is not an exact replica of the one in the show, but is still one that is definitely Power Rangers hot.POWER RANGERS TOYS AND ACCESSORIES:Power Ranger Training Set, Red Ranger SetPower Rangers Deluxe Megazord Samurai GigazordPower Rangers Megaforce Gosei Great MegazordPower Rangers Super Samurai, Black Box MorpherPower Rangers Megaforce Deluxe Gosei MorpherPower Ranger Samurai Megazord Action FigurePower Ranger Samurai Samurai Ranger Training GearPower Rangers Megaforce Sky Brothers Zord Vehicle and Red RangerPower Ranger Samurai ClawZord Action Figure"
It makes noise, it's Power Rangers and my boys love it.
At the touch of a button the Dragon Sword makes battles sounds etc, then another button causes the head to spin.
Not heavy but still a good size.
Only negative is that the Deluxe Gosei Morpher is not included - has to be purchased separately.
This is a great weapon for little kids to play around with!
Part of the blade is rubber so when you get stabbed, it doesn't hurt.
I am also happy that it makes sounds whenever you spin it, or push the button on the part closest to the blade.
If you hold the button closest to the blade and then spin the head, it will play a different song.
I sometimes wish that the handle is smaller so you can use it with only one hand while on the other hand, you can hold a shield or some other weapon.
They also sell a shield that slides onto the back of where the sound comes out.
That could be both good or bad.
I would recommend this to someone who has a child that is into Power Rangers and doesn't want anyone to be hurt.
Upon first glance this sword may look like it has a lot going on but once opened and ready to play the options are very limited.
It mainly makes noise...a lot of it... plus you can unlock other sounds and lights by inserting the card or connecting it to the deluxe Gosei Morpher which is sold separately and basically an extension to this toy.
The sword itself is not dangerous at all so kids will be safe playing with it plus the sword is very short so no need to worry about them knocking things over.
The sword is modeled after the same Ultra Dragon Sword in the Power Rangers Megaforce series, which I am not familiar with but my son is which explains why he was so fascinated and excited to receive this.
Loved by the kids  --  makes this grandma nervous.At least for grandma's house this is an &#34;outside / deck&#34; toy.But while it makes me nervous the kids absolutely LOVE it.transforms any little child (and even a grandpa) into a Power Ranger.
This sword is a decent size and durable.
I like that the blade is actually a softer plastic and not the hard clunky plastic that the handle is made of.
The softer blade means less chance of injury during play, if whacked with it.
You can buy Power Cards to insert, which enable more sounds.
Not too much action as far as lights - they are only on Zords eyes.
Zord also spins around when activated.
This sword would be a hit with any child who loves Power Rangers.
Both of my grandsons, 6 and 8, are big fans of the power rangers.
The sword is a good size for them.
It makes sounds and the head spins, and the boys were excited with it--at first.
The eight year old got bored with it pretty quick.
The six year old still stages pretend fights with it.
I gave it three stars because I thought it was overpriced for the amount of entertainment they got from it.
Now this is total awesome and brings about big smiles and a look of what can I get with that from an 8 year old boy.
My grandson's face lit up like a Christmas tree with this one.
Perfect size for him too as he's a bit smaller than most 8 year olds but it would work even for up to age 10 I would say.
It's a noise maker that's for sure and will give your child plenty of hours of real mind focusing entertainment as they try and think up imaginary foes to use it on.
That in itself should give it extra stars since they have to actually think instead of sitting in front of a game playing out what someone else already thought up.
This would be a great under the tree attraction getter on Christmas morning that's for sure.
This sword is nice and durable.
The spinning action at the one end is neat.
The only &#34;light&#34; action is the eyes that light up on this end of the sword.
I only hear one phrase over and over and one sound that plays over and over.
It's very repetitive.
There are evidently collectible cards that will unlock additional sounds but hearing the standard ones that come with the sword over and over gets old real quick.
The sound quality is a it on the poor side as well.
It's a bit loud too.Since there's not a whole lot to this sword I'd say it'd probably be geared more towards 4 or 5 year olds.
It's the perfect size for that age too.
It's not a very long sword compared to some of the others out there on the market.Overall this sword isn't bad, there's just not much to it.
If you have a 4 or 5 year old who's into Power Rangers than I'm sure they'll like this.
Otherwise I think I'd pass.
"My youngest son, an active four year old, loves Power Rangers.
He likes to imitate the Ninja moves and the other various actions the characters do on the show.
As an aside this also entertains my wife and I, as at his age, he looks more like the losing contestant from a Polka Party dance-off than a Ninja.
:-)  So when I saw this sword, the Power Rangers Deluxe Ultra Dragon Sword, I knew I had to order it for my son.The sword is a little over two feet long by about six inches wide.
On one end is a blade, while the other head has a dragon head.
The grip for your child is in roughly the middle of the sword, and it has two buttons, one at each end of the grip.
One button causes the sword to light up a bit and make sounds (including playing the Megaforce Power Ranger theme song), while the other button you squeeze down to make the dragon head at the bottom of the sword spin.
There is also a place on the outside of the grip where you can insert Power Cards, just like in the TV show.
The sword is made of a hard plastic, except for the tip of the sword and parts of the dragon's head, which are soft, pliable plastic (which helps prevent injuries during play).My boy was extremely excited when I gave him the sword, and loves to play with it.
The sword itself is modeled off of the ultra dragon sword from one of the episodes in the series, and he now loves to watch that one over and over while he plays with the sword.
We've had the sword for a few weeks now, and he hasn't gotten tired of it.
I suspect the length of time your child plays with this sword is dependent on how much he's ""into"" Power Rangers, but I suspect my little guy will be playing with this sword for weeks to come.Overall, this is a good choice for a young power ranger fan.
It has a few bells and whistles that help make it fun to play with.
While you should always supervise your children when playing with toys like this, it has some safety features that helps prevent your child from easily skewering their siblings.
Five stars."
If your kid is a big power ranger fan he'll love this toy.
If his hero du jour is sponge Bob Squarepants ,maybe not so much .
Personally I didn't find it all that exciting but I'm not seven years old.
I think it is a little over-priced, for what it is, but I think that about most toys lately.The seven-year old thought it was fun for about thirty minutes.
That comes out to about $1 a minute.
Maybe that's a weird way to judge a toy?
