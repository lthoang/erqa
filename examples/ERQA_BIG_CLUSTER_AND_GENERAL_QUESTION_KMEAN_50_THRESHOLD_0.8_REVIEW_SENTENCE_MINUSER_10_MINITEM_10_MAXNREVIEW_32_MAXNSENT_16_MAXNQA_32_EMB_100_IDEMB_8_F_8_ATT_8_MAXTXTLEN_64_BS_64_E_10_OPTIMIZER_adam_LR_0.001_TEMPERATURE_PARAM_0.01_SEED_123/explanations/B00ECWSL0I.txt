Reviews:
First off I do not have any background in this field.
I simply thought it would be fun for my son to learn with.
My son is really getting into anything science related so this kit was an excellent choice for him.
It is a starter kit so be aware that it won't come stocked with bells and whistles.
However, there is plenty to keep them busy.
My son has enjoyed learning about circuits and creating different projects with the starter kit.
He is also an internet person and has found a few sites while trying to &#34;fix&#34; something he made.
I would definitely look into getting some of the expansions and other kits from this company.
I did give it four stars because they are a little on the high side for pricing.
My son and I were very excited to try the little bit SelecTronics biscuit.
My son and I both have a reasonable amount of experience using systems like Elenco's Snap Circuits, though he is more electronics savvy when it comes to the inner workings of gadgets and I am more a maker of non-electronic stuff with an interest of adding some electronic functions to my creations.
LitttleBits is a fun & easily navigable way of providing the means  for children and adults to experiment with physical electronics components using simple instructions & giving the tinkerers near immediate results, which is definitely encouraging to those of us who are intimidated by such things.
Within 10 minutes of opening the kit, I made a motorized fishing line out of baker's twine, a paper lip, and a Swedish Fish.
I really liked that someone as non-tech savvy (compared to my 10 year old!)
as me could pick up the basic rules & run with it, focusing on the problem solving & creative aspects.
For my son, it was not as rewarding but I think that's because he is currently learning Arduino & he is really into the programming and wiring & littleBits removes that electronics nitty-gritty that he craves, and definitely is not as intensive &  involved in this set.
He can go play with his more technical stuff, but I'm going to keep playing with these littleBits!
My daughters and husband have tinkered around a bit with this and so far they've loved it.
A great educational toy, albeit pricey.
I really like what little bits has set out to do here.
They've made a very easy way for kids to tinker, without having to deal with poor connecting wires, and all the 'hard' parts.
Instead you have this very easy to setup kit that litterally snaps (magnetically!)
together.
The range of adapters here lets you do a lot of things, the manual is very well done, large, colorful, simple to understand.
The best part, is that when you get bored of these items, you can add on additional sensors.
They also offer some great modules, things like pressure sensors, motion triggers, all kinds of great things that will really spark the minds of kids and get them thinking.
I love this product and concept, the only downside is that I'll probably be hoarding sensors for the kids :)
The Littlebits Electronics Base Kit is a great educational toy to inspire kids to design and create their own electronic &#8220;gizmos.&#8221;  When my 8 year old son saw the box he immediately opened it and began tinkering with all the circuits.
Within a matter of 30 minutes he had made his first creation.
This was all before he even read the instructions.
Most toys that he gets receive a small amount of playtime before they are put away and forgotten.
Fortunately this kit has inspired him to create for days.
*** Positive Points: ***- Easy to use and not the least bit dangerous for most kids- Sturdy construction- Comes with everything you need to get started (including the battery)- Instructions are easy to follow- Online Site has videos which further inspire kids to create new inventions*** Negative Points: ***- Price is a bit high at $100- Does not provide a good explanation of individual pieces so kids may still seek parental helpOVERALL:  This is a great alternative to the mindless toys and electronics that eat up kids time without really teaching them anything.
This is a base kit for a kid's circuit builder toy.
It's well made and even though this base kit doesn't contain many components- you need to buy more parts to make the builds useful- it does give the child a few interesting functions.
So why the low rating from me?
The LED lights on one of the units in this kit are way too bright.
I don't think they are healthy for any child's eyes.
They are really bright.
I don't see a way to dim them down, hence the low rating.
"We had a blast playing with these modules!
Very easy to learn to use, with the helpful indication from the different colored pieces and the magnets polarity connecting them together the correct way only, it's a snap!
The possibilities are endless!
What a fabulous way to get anyone, imagining and creating!.
As you look at what the modules do you can envision future projects.
I am itching to get out the colored construction paper, string and glue and create a colorful powered mobile.
I can envision making some crazy interactive cat and parakeet toys with this set.
Possibly Pair it with Lego's or erector sets.
And I'm sure ""Barbie"" could get in on using a project or several...... maybe lighting up her own miniature Christmas tree with the very cool string light strand you can also build.
This set has major longevity for play.
The littlbits website had loads of idea's for projects, and you can video tape your creativity and post it up there for other's to try.
Also look for some great instructional video's on YouTube and Vimeo."
My 8-year-old got this set from Santa for Christmas along with two other similar sets and this one has gotten the most play time.
He also received a set of Snap Circuits which, in my opinion, is much more difficult to innovate with.
Right out of the box, before reading any directions, my kiddo was making things happen and he was delighted.
He also received the deluxe set of littleBits which includes even more parts to play with.The sets use a very basic color-coded system to show you how to use them.
Blue modules are power, pink are inputs (buttons, sound sensors, light sensors, etc), green are outputs (lights, fans, motors, etc) and orange are splitters that move or change the electrical current in some way.
This was so intuitive to him that within minutes he was imagining up projects.
His first idea was to use the orange wire modules to connect lights to his model cars to illuminate their headlights and give them undercarriage illuminations.
The motor comes with an attachment that connects to LEGO pieces, so that was his next step, and there was no stopping his inventions after that.This kit has ignited a passion for all things science and he is now begging me for more kits, chemistry sets, a microscope, telescope, you name it.
Being that my profession and schooling is based around science, it has given us something we can both enjoy and bond over.
My only gripe is the cost of this set.
You don't get very many pieces for the cost, but they are very high quality and so easy and fun to use.
There are cheaper sets that are very similar in theory but are not as intuitive or open-ended.
Overall, this has been his favorite gift for Christmas and I'm very pleased.
"For background before I begin my review, I am an electrical engineer who enjoys teaching his children about electronics.
I love educational toys and science toys, but I do tend to be critical of toys that I feel dumb down the science too much.
I had a friend who bemoaned that microprocessor development kits like Arduino teach thousands of kids to blink an LED with a million transistors, and yet they are left not knowing how to blink an LED with one transistor.
That being said, kits like Arduino has introduced many to the ""maker"" movement and engineering in general, so I have no problem with the concept of simplified tools for beginners.All of this introduction brings me to ""Little Bits"".
I gave this set to my 6 year old and 8 year old to play with, starting with the 8 year old.
He loves hisElenco Snap Circuits SC-750R Student Training Program, and makes all sorts of cool things, so I thought he would be the best to evaluate it.When you open the box, you are ready to go.
The high quality box has a magnetic flap for closure, and inside is a full color glossy manual and all of the ""little bits"".
Each of the little bits has only an input and and output, so no multiple connections or wires to make.
There are blue (for power), pink (for control), orange (wires), and green (for actions).You get a custom printed 9V battery (no searching for batteries - thank you!
), and a bunch of modules.
There is 1 power module.
This module has a plug for the 9V battery, a switch, and a red indicator LED.
For you engineers, the module has an ST LD1117 linear regulator on it.There are 3 pink control modules, a button, a light sensor, and a dimmer.
I really do wish they would use the technical term instead of the popular one on these modules.
For instance, the button module is a simple on-off button.
Why not call it a switch?
As an engineer and a homeschooling dad, I'm always looking for easy ways to teach my kids about electronics.
This kit fits the bill perfectly.
It has many versatile uses, but also is very easy to wire correctly.
My kids are below the recommended age, but even my four year-old enjoys using this kit with supervision, and understands most of the concepts, albeit at a more basic level.
It's something they can use as a toy with me now, and grow into using it for their own experiments.The kit itself has a number of pre-designed experiments you can do, and like any good building tool, you can put it together in your own unique combinations.
I'll update here if we have any longevity issues, but it seems solidly designed so far.
This is definitely becoming a regular part of our homeschool electronics curriculum.
my boys LOVE this setso much we need to order more for themat first they were really not so sure what to think of this &#34;toy&#34;once they played around a little and did some googling to really understand the possibilitiesthat also made them aware they wanted more for their kit lolthey have used it to make several interesting items i can not even keep trackof everything they have created they then will take video of what they have madeso they can go back and tweak it later when they want to make it againi personally really like this base kit because and how much it makes them think outside the boxand it gets my older kids especially off of their computer and interacting more with each otheras well as their friends when they ccome over they all love to get involved and see what they can makewe even have one separate small box from recyclables that we keep for them only in case they might need something
I thought the 8 year old would be interested in this littleBits Base Kit, but it turned out the 5 year old grabbed it and started playing with it.
It is beyond his age level to follow the various instructions to create the projects illustrated, but he enjoys connecting the various modules together to see what works with what, and how many things he can get the battery to power.
He has had no problem making the connections, because the magnetic attraction of the correct matching ends makes it very easy to line things up properly.
Unlike a lot of toys that disappear into the maw of the toy boxes and storage baskets, this toy has maintained pride of place on his bedside table.As an adult, I was very impressed by this toy.
It's easy to assemble, the instruction booklet is clear, and the box it comes in is great for storing the various small modules.
There are three trays that fit into the box, so each module has its own indentation in the trays, and there is apparently a magnet on the box flap so it seals tightly so the modules won't easily fall out of the box.
Since the modules can be assembled in a logical order, it's very easy for the child to understand the cause-and-effect of connecting the different modules together.
It's a very good introduction to electronics, and there is a sufficient number of modules so that the child won't get bored quickly - the combinations are endless on their own, and when additional craft materials are added, there's no limit to what their imaginations can design.The only reason why I didn't give this five stars is because the light wire module only worked once and then it stopped lighting.
Since it is one of the &#34;major&#34; modules and an obvious effect module, it's lack of operation eliminated some of the potential projects that the little guy would have been able to use it for.
I have a nephew who's really into science and a niece who enjoys craft projects.
This is the perfect educational toy for them to have hours of fun: together!
The projects are fun and really work, and the pieces are very durable.
If you are looking for a great learning toy for your children this holiday season, this is it!
If you want something educational and fun, it&#8217;s hard to go wrong with this.
I really like how this doesn&#8217;t look like a toy, or a dumbed-down kid version of electronic components.
These are the real thing and kids can go wild building with these.
My son is much younger than the recommended age.
He&#8217;s five but he&#8217;s still able to play with them with guidance.
He&#8217;s already built a windmill thingy.
(I&#8217;m not entirely sure what it is but it spins and he&#8217;s delighted by the fact that he made it.
)And that&#8217;s the other good thing about these - you really can&#8217;t break them.
He can tinker with them to his hearts desire and the polarity of the magnets ensures that they only come together the correct way.As for the price, I think they are expensive because these are not mainstream.
I&#8217;m sure the more popular they become, the price will get lower into a more accessible range.
In the mean time, if you&#8217;re able to get these at a good price, I would recommend you snatch them up!
This is for the builder in anyone.
Kids can have a lot of fun with this.
We built the flashlight and it came out great.
We followed the directions and it was working.
This is great to teach your kids for homeschooling as well.
This is indeed educational as well as fun.
We are going to try to build the windmill next but using legos.
I think that will be a blast for my kids to do as a family project.
This is also great to help your kids with that science project as well.
Fun and educational.
What an excellent building/learning set.
So small, but you can watch things happen with your very own creativity and engineering!
My only complaint, if you can call it that, is that it is expensive.
Like everything in life, you get what you pay for!
Well worth it!
This is like the circuit board kits of yesteryear, but most of the circuitry is done already.
That means what's left is a focus on the creativity of figuring out what to do with the circuits, and things can get moving right out of the box.I started off just by doing the one on the cover of the box, and also did all the starter circuits in the booklet.
It literally takes under a minute to complete one of the combinations, and then marvel at what each component is capable of.
That being said, a lot of time can be devoted to inventing (or creating) something more advanced to do with them.
Common household objects can be used, and they also strongly encourage using LEGO elements (such as an axle and wheel--more on this later) in your designs.
The projects included are a tickle machine, prank handshake, night rider (bicycle light), flashlight, art bot (it does freestyle drawings), doorbell, lil' breezy (a windmill/fan), and three wheeler.Aside from all the smaller projects, I attempted to make the art bot with various pieces and parts, including three different LEGO wheels (one wouldn't fit the axle, so maybe I should say two) and a different, homemade axle.
The various attempts didn't work.
My thought is perhaps they intend for the wheel to be a stationary one, but this isn't specified.
I wish they had been more specific about which LEGO wheels to use--as LEGO fans know, there are many styles and types.
This would have been my favorite project in the set, had it worked, but, because of that, the morning alarm (light sensitive) wins.The most frustrating thing for me when working with them is that the magnets that snap the circuit bits together aren't as strong as they probably should be.
The weight of the modules can separate the various parts if something else isn't supporting them, especially while you're working on creating your invention.
One little jar or nudge, and your line of littleBits can separate.So, I have a couple of negative things to say about the set.
But, that being said, I really like the concept of littleBits, the focus on creativity, and that they encourage people to be inventive and make things.
One last thing--if you like the concept, you might want to consider getting a larger set, so you'll have more things to choose from.
Lots of pieces to make all sorts of cool devices, gadgets and toys.
Best for 10 through teen or older - fun for adults too!
No tools or previous experience required.
No adult help needed either - though my children keep bringing new things to show me.
Younger kids can have fun with this too, but my younger teens find it the most interesting.The pieces include all sorts of sensors, timers, buttons, lights, buzzers, etc etc etc to make hundreds of different devices (there are 15 in the instructions, just enough to teach you to make your own inventions).My young teens love making all sorts of things - so far their favorite is wiring up a buzzer to a switch they hold in their palm which surprises people when they shake hands.
Some of the components can be adjusted - the LED color can be set using RGB adjustments, so of course my daughters made it bright pink when hooking it up.
It only takes a few minutes to assemble new things, and in almost no time my 13 year old daughter was inventing new things based on her understanding of how each piece works.While this won't give them a detailed low-level understanding of each electronics component, it does show how electronics parts work together and inspires children to think about possibilities and make them real.
I think this is a great way to introduce children to electrics - low enough level to understand while high enough level to have fun making things that are interesting and actually do something.
And no soldering, crimping, etc - just touch the pieces together and magnets hold them in place, freeing the children to invent without adult supervision.VERY fun and VERY educational - got my daughters fascinated with electronics, and I am amazed at how versatile it is, while being very easy to assemble.
While there are plenty of pieces included, we will be looking for expansion modules as this is one of the best educational toys we've ever seen!
This has a few key features and functions that make it fun to create the different projects provided and sprout other ideas.
The bits really do just pop together with magnets, so no soldering needed, but still shows the concept of electronics.
It has been fun to work on this with my son and then answer his questions about how other things work with electricity.
