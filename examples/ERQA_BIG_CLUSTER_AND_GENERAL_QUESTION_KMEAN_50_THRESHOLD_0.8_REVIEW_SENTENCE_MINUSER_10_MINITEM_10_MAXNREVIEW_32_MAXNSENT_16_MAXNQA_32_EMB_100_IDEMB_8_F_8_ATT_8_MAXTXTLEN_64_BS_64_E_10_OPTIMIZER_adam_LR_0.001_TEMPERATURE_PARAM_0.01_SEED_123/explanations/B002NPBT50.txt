Questions:
is this the first level game?
Would this be good for a 7 year old?
What age is this maze for?
Cheating? Want to cheat at Perplexus, the maze ball?  Get a strong magnet, wrap it in a bit of cloth or tissue so you won't scratch the outside of the ball. Pick up the ball with the magnet and maneuver it above your target spot. Pull the magnet from the ball and it drops into place.
what age is best for this toy?
are you able to smash it on the ground
My daughter loves it!  We are just wondering where the end of each maze is?  Or does it just go to a certain number for the end of each maze?
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
"We love Perplexus.
Admiteddly, my 7 year old gets frustrated sometimes trying to ""beat the puzzle"" but there are so many different mazes, critical thinking to get past different hurdles, and such that it is a great toy.
Watching her puzzle through how to get around different obstacles is cool.
She thinks about what it will take to prevent the ball from dropping off after she has already gotten really far.+'s+ all course work well in our latest Perplexus.
We have had no issues with the swing arm+ lots of great tactical thinking, and good motor skills challenge-'s- Still don't love the watermark, even if they have made it easier to see thru.
My daughter complains every time that she can't see thru it well.We love it!
Overall 5 stars!"
I really like the simple concept of this toy, especially the fact that it is self-contained.
No hunting down a lost piece.
And it's kind of fun.
I've spent a little time sliding the marble around myself.
The flaw is that most of the numbers are molded onto the plastic track rather than printed in a different color.
This makes those numbers nearly impossible to see from certain angles.
Now you're holding the ball so the marble stays precariously on the track and it's not the same angle you need to see the number to which you were trying to take that marble.
How's that for annoying?
This is a great gift for kids since there aren't a lot of parts to it that can be misplaced.
I bought one of these for a 7 year old as a birthday gift and it was one of the few gifts at the party that could be unboxed and played with by all the kids because pieces wouldn't go missing.I also bought one for my kids, and after we all played with it for some time, found that it's definitely a challenge for both kids and adults.The whole toy is about the size of a small volleyball.
It's not huge, but not so small you can't see it to play it either.
Brightly colored and well made, it definitely looks as fun as it is to play.
My strongest recommendation is to have good lighting because it is hard to see some of the numbers deeper inside the maze.
It is especially challenging when you start losing your near eyesight (hello over 45-year olds!
)It is a lot of fun seeing how far you can move the marble along the maze with a group of friends.
The stand is a nice touch too, because you can pause play to do something else.Attention to detail required, and this might not make a good toy for kids that require constant mental stimulation.
The first time I picked this toy up I was definitely perplexed.
It took a younger person to explain it to me.
The numbers are almost impossible to see, but this is a good toy to keep kids occupied.
It does not require batteries.
How durable it is, remains to be seen, most of it is just plastic.
I have read some of the other reviewer's complaints about the arm not swining and the cloudy logo on the ball.
This doesn't seem to be a problem with our ball.This is a very addictive game.
The comments other reviewers made about family members fighting to use this are true.This is a three-d maze.
You start the ball in the one slot and then you follow the numbers.
It sounds simple but it's not.If you are like me and want a toy that engages the mind, encourages exploration of the world, does more than have a button you push, does more than make noise, doesn't include a screen- this is an excellent one.
It is something young children can do and older children and adults can do.
Not only can they do it, but they will do it for hours.WE have had ours for a while and haven't completely conquered it.
We are getting better though.
So while you can buy a double pack, you probably won't need to do that.Enjoy.
"I had been checking out and eyeing this toy for the past couple of years for Christmas.
I love puzzle types of games as do my children and nephews/nieces.
When I saw this was up for Vine review, I did not hesitate to grab it.
It was not exactly what I thought it would be, though I am not completely sure what I was expecting, lol.
However, I think it is a very fun maze game that makes the user really concentrate while they try to steer the small metal ball through the different mazes.This maze game is very simple, yet can be maddening, lol.
There are 3 separate maze tracks within the enclosed larger ball.
You must begin at either ""1"", ""2"" or ""3"" and try to wind, twist and turn the little metal ball through the track.
Now, this is no easy feat considering you have to really pay attention to which way you have to turn the maze ball to get the metal ball to stay on track.
One wrong move or jerk of your hand and the metal ball will fall of the track and you will have to begin again!I think it is fun and a great way to learn focus and concentration.
My 10-year-old daughter says that the maze game is incredibly addicting and she loves to grab is and spend a few minutes playing it.
The colorful tracks are very pleasing to the eye and the clinking of the metal ball as it runs through the tracks are fairly soothing.This is a great little game to play to unwind or pass a bit of time.
It also comes with a little plastic dome that you can sit the ball on when not playing.
We just leave this out on the table and is there for anyone who would like to give it a go.
It is colorful, fun and a great little piece to have out for family and friends when they are sitting around chatting or visiting.
Great for kids and people of all ages!"
"This maze game comes in a couple of different levels, this one being the ""easiest"".
But it's not easy, by any means.
It's challenging, but that's what makes it's so addicting!We had originally allowed our child to keep this in his room, but so many people wanted to play with it it was relocated to a more central location.
It has a stand so it doesn't roll around (small plastic thing, does the trick) and can be placed on a shelf.
The purpose is to go from one level to the next, in order by number, and end at the finish.
It sounds easier than you think.My one issue:  not a quiet game.
So if the sound of a small metal ball hitting the side of plastic over and over again might get on your nerves, might want to look elsewhere.This game is great for teaching patience and persistence - we love it around here."
When I saw the Perplexus Maze Game by PlaSmart it looked like a game for a little child, but when I started playing with it I found it to be a game for all ages!
It is so much fun.
It may look very simple, but it takes a lot of work to master the game.
I don't see any of my family getting bored with this game anytime soon.
As other reviewers have mentioned it makes a perfect Christmas gift.The quality of the game construction is really good - nice and sturdy.
Looks like it will last for years.
I thought this was just another maze game that any 6 year old could do.
Boy am I surprised that I have not been able to complete the first track yet, after several attempts.
I was afraid that it would be too easy.
I'd just do it once or twice and then pass it on to my grandsons.
Not so fast there Gramma!
It has a longer play value than I thought.
I found myself laughing when I made the same mistakes over & over.
I'll master it yet.
Then, MAYBE I'll let someone else try it!
There is only one small problem with it.
The segments of the track and obstacles are numbered, I think, to give you direction and help with creating a game with it.
But, most of them are just molded into the colored plastic and don't stand out well.
A few have been colored in and it makes me wonder why they all aren't like that.
It doesn't hinder the challenge.
But, it may make it harder to keep score if you were to play competitively.It says it's for ages 6 and up.
But, I think it's suitable for ages 8 to 88.
I thought I was getting this for the kids but my co-workers got excited when they found out I was getting one.
I took it into work and put it on a table (next to the candy bowl) and most visitors picked it up and started playing with it.
After the novelty wears off at work, I'll try it out on the kids.This strikes me as a great car toy to keep the kids entertained for lengthy rides.
It doesn't have to keep their attention long, just long enough.I give high marks for educational value as it requires focus and planning to navigate the maze.Because this is my first experience with this maze game, I lack the comparison insight seen in other reviews.
As a novice, I say this is an excellent game and seems reasonably priced.I'll likely buy more.
Seems to be well built and is very colorful.
Would make for a good gift due to its interesting look alone.
Play wise it is easy to pick up on the basic concept.
Moving the ball through the various maze elements is fun and at times challenging.
Trying to pick up the pace ups the difficulty.
Great for kids and adults alike.
Even after solving it it is still fun to pick later and just move the ball through the various elements.
For the price it is worthwhile and an item that will hold your initial attention and also be something that overtime you will try again and again.
We've had fun with this, but the 6yo's interest waned pretty quickly.
The Jr version would probably be more appropriate for him I suspect.It's not really that difficult, however there are spots where it's just very easy to fall off, and that makes it more of a fiddly skill/luck game rather than actually a maze.The numbers molded into the plastic that tell you how far you've gone and in what order to do things are almost impossible to read, but for the most part where to go next is pretty obvious.Overall it's the sort of thing that you want to play with when you see it, but a lot of people will get it out of their system in ten minutes or so and then maybe never pick it up again.Of course it looks cool sitting on a shelf too, and definitely gets people's interest when they see it.G.
"This is one fun toy and there are NO small pieces to lose.
Our whole family enjoys twisting and turning this sphere to move the small stainless ball through challenging paths.
There are a total of 100 ""check points"" that is divided into 3 paths.
Path one ends where Path 2 starts which ends where Path 3 starts.
You carefully twist and turn the tiny ball to move it through the path.
The tiny ball will drop off if you twist and turn with too much force and you will have to start over.
However, if you are tired of one path, you can start at a different one.
So far, each one of us has enjoyed it in different ways.My 5 year old is proud that he has gone through about half of the first path (relatively easy).
My 7 year old finished Path 1 and is working on finishing Path 2.
My husband and I are less frequent players so we are also working on finishing Path 2.
Somehow, none of us have successfully finished Path 2 or 3 yet.This is a great alternative to video games as it involves more tactile interaction with a physical object.
It is the only toy where both the kids and the adults have enjoyed playing.Just one note about design and quality.
The path markers are stamped on the plastic path (no contrasting color) so it is difficult to make out unless you play under a very bright light.
It is not that big of a deal once you know the path but they could have added some contract to the path markets.
Also, we were so thrilled about this toy that we gave one to our friends.
Unfortunately, for their Perplexus, there was one overly-long screw blocking one of the paths so they only have 2 paths to play rather than 3.
This is challenging for everyone at first go - and there are 3 mazes within this ball.
The mazes are a modern day labyrinth game (remember the old wooden labyrinths?)
- they twist and turn with 360 degree turns and drops.
The bright colors and light weight keep kids interested - although it is challenging enough to frustrate my 8 year old.Bottom line: Fun.
Recommended - a great family game to leave around the coffee table or take on long car rides.
I recommend it for everyone that has even the slightest sense of humor.
"The Perplexus Maze Game is for folks who are patient and like mazes but that probably was obvious from the game type.
The Maze Game I have has clear labeling at both ends so there isn't any ""frosted writing"" that mars play by obstructing view of any part of the course.Pros:  For folks who like those older fashion marble through the maze games or handheld pinball games, this is fun.
The swinging arm can present a bit of a headache but that makes the maze more challenging if you have patience.
Once you start, it is hard to put down, as you do want to succeed and conquer the maze.Nuetral: It isn't what my family would call a ""family"" game as you are mostly just waiting around while one person plays and I would suspect younger kids would be ""grabbing"" impatiently for their turn.Cons: While it is fun for folks who like mazes it doesn't have a lot of ""replayability"" by the same person or small group of people.
The teen member of this family WHO LOVES MAZES was happy to engage in trying to succeed and ran the path a couple of times once he had success but isn't interested in completing the game faster (besting his own personal time)or playing against other people's times.
Though he might pick it up again at some future date and run the course when enough time has passed.So, this is is a good item for maze lovers and folks who have different people over frequently where it can be pulled out and played as ""new"" or as a fun challenge with someone who hasn't encountered it before."
Got this with my 9 year old in mind and he really loves the challenge -  and for him it is a challenge.
He has enough patience to stick to it though.
The game is really colorful and exciting for the eye and it keeps one interested.The game says ages 6 and up but I think that may be pushing it unless your 6 year old is REALLY patient or has really good motor control.
A 6 year old will be very interested in trying but if they like to win and get frustrated easily this would not be a game for them!The game is good for adults too quite honestly.
It's not too easy at all!
It takes some amount of concentration and practice actually.This is a good game for 8 years old and up in my estimation... someone who likes puzzles or mazes and has a good amount of concentration.
"I adore Leapfrog and Vtech and Mobigo and Wii and all the rest... really, I do.
I think they make terrific games for kids, many of which are very educational.
But I also have a daughter who would sit and play on a little screen all day if I let her.
I don't let her.It's a challenge sometimes to find non-electronic games that can really hold a child's attention.
I noticed that a reviewer here said that her 5-year-old really enjoyed this, so I took the shot and hoped that my 5 1/2-year-old would, too.
To be honest, it's still a bit past her.
I flunked spatial relations on my aptitude tests back in my school days, and my daughter's motor skills need some work, so both of us could benefit from this game.
It is the kind of thing that you will find hard to quit until you ""solve"" it, like a Rubik's Cube.It's well constructed and colorful, and very challenging to me as an adult.
So far, my only complaint is the ""watermark"" on top and bottom that says Perplexus.
I find it distracting to have to look through it when I'm trying to move the ball around in those two areas.
I don't understand the need for it... or at least it could have been just one significantly significantly smaller etching.
Annoying that marketing comes before functionality, when the rest of the toy seems to be designed so painstakingly.I like that this is an exercise that will strengthen so many skills: patience, persistence, fine motor skills, problem-solving, memory, and spatial relations.
I'm sure there are other side-benefits I'm not thinking of.
But I think this is a very cool game if you need to clear your mind and yet keep yourself sharp at the same time."
"I got this toy to give as a gift to a younger child.
But my son (11.5) happened to see it and all of a sudden he was hooked.
Finally something beside his ipod or video games to keep him busy!
So far he's taken this in the car, on the school bus and argues with his 8-yr old sister over who gets to play it next.
This definitely took me by surprise, because I thought it was for a younger child.
I love anything that focuses my children's attention on something besides ""technology"" for a few minutes and this did the trick!!"
The Perplexus by now is a well known toy for many, but if you haven't seen it before, the goal is to take a metal marble and work it through a 3-dimensional maze that is housed inside a sphere.
It is really fun and can literally have you going for hours trying to get the marble to go where you want.
It takes a lot of coordination and thinking to plan your next move where you have to rotate the sphere perfectly to get the marble through.
There are 3 levels of play inside the Perplexus, with fun paths like a moving arm with a magnet and a spiral path through the ball.I played with a Perplexus last year, and it seems that the one I just received is a little better built.
The Perplexus logo is moulded into the sphere, and it feels a little thicker and more durable, perhaps due to some design changes from the earlier units which had issues.
The Perplexus also includes a handy display stand, so you can keep it on display, begging people to pick it up and play.One note if you've never seen this before - it is very colorful and looks like a toy for a small child, but I wouldn't think a kid younger than 6 would find it much fun.
It takes a lot of coordination and patience, so despite the colorful plastic look, it's not for a small kid.Highly recommended and a great price for a really challenging maze toy.
"Simply put, my family loves the Perplexus.
I was given this one--but would happily buy this--it's that good.You know those ball-in-the-maze games that are given out as party favors or school carnival prizes?
This is one of those on steroids.
It's a 3-D maze that you turn in all directions as you guide the little silver ball through each challenge.
There are curves, spirals, drops, a ""tightrope"", and a little swinging arm.I picked this up because I thought it would be a good alternative to ""the screen"" for my children.
Five minutes after opening the box, I was hooked.
Once my 8 and 5-year-old kids got ahold of it, they were hooked.
Now we have to share!The fun is in figuring out how to maneuver the ball through each challenge.
The 3-D aspect forces you to think about each move and anticipate where you want the ball to go.
Part of the maze is simple, but there are some very tricky moves that reward your patience and persistence with a sense of accomplishment.
(And, if the ball drops off the maze it's easy to reset and start over.)
So far no one has gotten all the way to 100, but none of us are giving up.
I suggest watching the videos that accompany this listing to see how it works.My only complaint is that the numbers are almost impossible for my middle-aged eyes to see.
They're molded into the plastic rather than stamped in a contrasting color (except for #27).
But it doesn't matter since we're all more focused on the path than the numbers and once you learn the path you don't need to see the numbers anyway.This would make a unique gift for puzzle-loving kids (and adults).
This would be awesome as an enrichment activity in a classroom.
"This is an amazing feat in engineering!
It is easy at times and very difficult at others.
There are multiple starting points so that you don't have to start at #1 and keep making the same mistakes over and over.
Turning the maze while your little ball is precariously balanced takes practice and patience.It is a lot of fun and is not a toy that is ""done with"" in an hour.
My kids will go back to it over and over.
After completing the maze you can race to beat a time or see if you can get through with no falls, etc.We took this to a family holiday party and it was the hit of both children and adults.It seems to be well made but since I haven't been able to get through the whole maze yet, I'm not sure if there are any hiccups in the process."
Ever played with one ofthese?
Remember how hard those puzzles were, and how compelling?
I was never able to guide the marble through the whole track, but I'd still sometimes spend hours trying.
The Perplexus sphere is a lot like the Labyrinth box, and in some ways even trickier and more compelling.
Yes, they're both about guiding a ball bearing down a track, and yes, they both seem to tap into the brain's reward circuitry with brutal effectiveness.
The similarities end there, however.
* Perplexus has three starting points, one at the beginning of each third of the track, so that you can practice the later stages of the track without having to start all the way at the beginning each time, but that won't make things any easier.
* You turn the sphere with your hands, unlike the Labyrinth box where you guide the ball through the track by tilting the field using the knobs on the side.
But again, this added convenience is easily matched by the Perplexus' additional challenge of having to guide the ball in three-dimensions on a path not entirely dissimilar to certain Escherian nightmares.
* Unlike the Labyrinth box, where you advance the marble by slipping it past holes in the field, here the goal is simply to keep the ball on the track, with the risk of throwing the ball off each time you have to turn the sphere.
Just because you don't have to worry about holes in the track doesn't make Perplexus any easier.The Perplexus sphere has the makings of an absolute and enduring classic, and I look forward to being aggravated and ensared at whiles by Perplexus for years to come.
This maze is great.
There are lots of different ways to get it to go to the right spot.
The kids keep trying to get it right.
Works well on the hand/eye coordination.
Great for all ages, even adults.
I grabbed this for my almost 5 year old son, and he loves it.
At first he was easily frustrated with it, but after showing him how it works, and how to get and keep the ball on the track, he's all over it.
He showed it to my husband when he came home from work and they proceeded to spend 40 minutes sitting on the couch together deep in concentration, trying to keep that ball on it's track, my husband still in his BDU's.Overall, I absolutely recommend this little toy.
It's challenging and teaches my son to be patient and focus on the task at hand.
Every now and again he'll struggle with it and my husband will get all fatherly and ask him to bring it to him so he can 'fix it', but really, I think that's just an excuse for him to be able to play with it himself :)
When I received this toy not only had I never seen it before, but I was quite nervous about either one of my children enjoying it.
Both are easily frustrated and quickly bored of things that aren't easily conquered.
Challenge isn't something they take on well.I was pleasantly surprised that they kept coming back to the Perplexus, time and time again.
They would play, get frustrated and put it down but come back and pick it up again later.
We haven't come to a point where we time each other or have races.In all honesty, the person who loves it most is my husband.
This is a toy I'd consider to buy any child and family.
I told my wife this was a toy for my son, but who am I kidding.
This was for me.
My son is 3 1/2, he'll have no idea what to do with this for at least a couple of years.So, do you remember the little black plastic labyrinth game with one knob on the right-hand side of the box and one in the front, and you'd try to get that shiny silver ball bearing through the maze without falling into one of the many numbered holes?
I still have mine.
I loved that game, and at 44, I still haven't managed to get it all the way through, although I've been close many times.Well, this game is meant to be a third-dimensional version of that one.
You start by putting the little ball bearing in one of three slots, and then you rotate the ball in order to keep it on the track.
It is a challenge, and definitely in the spirit of those old-time labyrinth games.
If you can think of that famous drawing by MC Eischer; with the stairs and ledges that nonsensically go this way and that, and people walking them are upside-down while others are sideways, then you can understand the concept of this game and how to maneuver the ball bearing through the plexiglass orb.A couple of things about the game; the numbers on the tracks are very, very hard to see.
If they had used a different color paint on the raised/recessed surfaces of the numbers, that alone would have been worth a half a star in my rating.
The other thing is (and this might actually add to the challenge) is there's so much stuff in the orb that sometimes it's easy to lose track of the ball bearing and where to go next.
If you move but a bit to see where you need to go, you might just fall off the track.For around $15, this is an interesting test of skill and an interesting new look on the old labyrinth.
I don't think it's for kids, even six or seven, but more like nine to adult.
It's a lot of fun and I recommend it.
We absolutely love this toy.
It gets played with and played with.
I was concerned that once they figured it out they would be bored, but there are several ways to play the maze, and with the dexterity involved, it has yet to get boring.
This is a great learning game.
Great for dexterity.
I did play with one in the store that was broken, but ours has seen a lot of hands, and has not yet broken.
I will post an update if it breaks soon.
The recommended age range for this maze game is 6-14, but I've found that even adults find it fun and addicting.
This game requires patience, and hand-eye coordination in order to move the tiny ball through the maze- you have to twist and turn the ball as you go, it's a fascinating 3D twist on any puzzle or maze I've ever seen.
While the game may sound super easy it's not, and the more you play the harder it is to put it down.This would make a fantastic gift for the person who has 'everything', and one of my favorite things is that it does not require batteries!
What it is, is a 3D version of a marble balance maze.
You will have to guide a metal marble through the maze, with all the twists and turns.
You may think what is the challenge with that?
But this is not a walk in the park.
It can be very hard depending on your hand steadiness and dexterity.
You also need a good sense of orientation.
My 8 year old son has reached farther than me.
He is at level 70`s while I am still struggling to get past level 50.If your marble falls, you have 3 places to start; you don't really have to start from the very beginning.
Perplexus is a well-thought out game.
Imaginative.Cons:- the numbers (1-100) easier to see are very difficult to see.
There are times when you don't know where to turn as the numbers are embossed but can't really read it angles.Overall, it is a unique engaging puzzle.
It is fun.
It can be frustrating to those who easily lose patience, but so is Angry Birds.
I have had the Perplexus Maze Game available for 3rd - 5th Grade students to use.
It is always in demand.
Kids love to see who can get the farthest in the maze before the ball falls off the track.
It requires concentration, patience, problem solving, thinking ahead, coordination and determination.
What impresses me most is that students who may otherwise get frustrated with tedious activities can spend a long time engrossed in this game.
A great gift idea.
This is such a neat little plaything.
I have it set in my office at home, and anyone that ventures in picks it up and doesn't put it down until one of two things happen: they succeed, or, more likely, the become frustrated after half an hour.I've handled it a few times, and have succeeded only ever once.
It appears simple upon initial glance, but it is a great thing for amusement for both kids and adults, and even better to have at the office.I may bring it to my work office to see how much play it gets!
