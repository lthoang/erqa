If you responded yes to even one of these then you will love Scrabble's newest creation!
I absolutely adore this Scrabble game.
Not a big deal, but when I am in a word frenzy with a clock beating down on me....  You get my point; I LOVE SCRABBLE!Highly recommend, not only for Scrabble aficionados' but young children that have the ability to read.
The game has 3 modes of play and you can do anywhere from 3 letter words to 5 letter words only game.
I would defintely recommend this inexpensive game for anyone looking to purchase gifts to put under the tree.

Reviews:
Who would have thought you could play scrabble with electronic tiles?
Very neat.
The game has 3 modes of play and you can do anywhere from 3 letter words to 5 letter words only game.
Different modes of play are 3-5 letter words with fixed 5 letters, or 5 letter words with 5 rotating letters.
When playing with multiple players, you just take turns.
The game is easy to pick up and play and the instructions are very clear.
It comes with a case that fits all 5 tiles in, as shown in the picture.When you line up the tiles and they spell a correct word, the tiles flash indicating you got points scored.
In the end, it will show you what your score is, and what was the maximum number of words you could have scored with those letters.
Don't get mad at yourself if you can't find all the words it says you could have.
From what I hear, Scrabble has an official word list that proves these are words, however, most to all just aren't used by everyday folks.Future improvements that would be nice would be color screens and more sounds, maybe go even crazier with more tiles.
But it's a start.Neat game and mostly anyone can pick it up and play.
Time flies when you get 5 random letters and can't think of a word to make out of it.
This is truly amazing, Scrabble is a great past time for many and most kids these day would simply shun it as knowing they have to work their brain to play but I think this is just what everyone wanted!Fast, Fun, Good old family nights.
This isnt played like your typical version of scrabble in the fact that there are different variations of the game more like an unscramble/find the hidden word/s.There is even a 1 player mode which is great for alot of people that need a little challenging bit to pass the time.They put some work into making this different that what the scrabble name entails and I love it!The blocks are cell battery powered and seem very sturdy so if they happen to get thrown around a bit I see no problems in harming the devices.One of the only drawbacks is that some of the words it asks you to come up with are weird and or never heard before so that might make smaller ones loose interest as there isnt a way to set the word difficulty or anything like that, but if that was included it would be 115% perfect!All in all a great game that is going to get alot of use out of me!
:)
"To begin with, this is a wholly unoriginal game that nearly everyone has played before.
Since the early days of the Apple II, there was a game called Shifty Sam that did exactly the same thing as this game.
Today, there are clones like Astraware's Textwist.
Nevertheless, I cannot understate how much fun my family is having with moving the tiles rather than tapping/clicking a screen!The game consists of 5 tiles (and a neat carry case which makes this ""board"" game measure only about 4"" x 2"" for storage).
You simply line up the tiles, press the button for the variation you want to play (1 and 2 are one player variants, while 3 is a multiplayer variant), and start.
As soon as the game starts, the tiles fill with one letter each.
Your job?
In about a minute, you have to slide the tiles next to each other to form words of three to five letters.
If you get it right, the tiles flash, beep, and record your score.
When the time is up, the letters disappear and you line up the tiles again to see your score.
The score is how many words you made out of how many were possible.As with any game of this type, the ""dictionary"" such as it is consists of a set of words the programmer thought completed the possible set of creatable words.
I have come across the occasional actual word that isn't programmed in, so you don't get credit for those.The beauty of this game is that it is both addictive, variable, and portable.
You can play on any flat surface, even a pretty small one.
The game is playable by one or multiple players.
And it is hard to stop playing!
My ten year old son hogged the game for hours last night!
"My 8 yr old daughter received this Scrabble Flash Cubes for a birthday gift.
If you enjoy word games such as Boggle or Upwords, Scrabble Flash Cubes will be a lot of fun for you.
Yes, it is fast paced and addictive.Would have been a great educational tool except there is no way to list the words a player found after a round, or the actual words possible in the MAX total.
The game has no way for 2 or more players to play using the exact same letter cubes.
Letters change at random each time so players can't compete finding possible words from the same letter cubes.Consider this as a fun gift for older children and adults and everyone will have a great time.WAYS IT COULD BE BETTER:1) If it could display the words that you found after a round.2) If you could display the missing words that you did not find after a round.3) If the tile combinations were numbered so you could choose tile combinations that were ""stumping"" you again and again.I understand that this would probably make it cost more.
But I would like to see those improvements in a deluxe version."
Once I managed to get all five electronic Scrabble tiles out of the box (which, believe me, was a massive battle), I really enjoyed this game.
The technology is innovative and quite impressive.
The game is easy to figure out and fun to play.
It's a game that I think will be especially good for families to play with younger children who are trying to improve their reading and writing skills.
The only complaint I have regarding game play is that the tiles are kind of small, and the only person who has a good view of them is the person whose turn it is.
So, if it's not your turn, it's kind of boring to just sit there because there's nothing much for you to watch.
Similarly, a parent trying to assist a child with spelling would have to lean close over the kid's shoulder in order to help.
Overall, though, this is a fun new approach to the classic game of Scrabble.
I absolutely adore this Scrabble game.
I got it as part of the Amazon Vine program.
Right out of the box, I played it with my family which included older members as well as two under 12 year old grandchildren.
We all loved it.
It was fun as well as easy to set up and learn to use.
I know for a fact that the younger members took a tremendous interest in this version of Scrabble (which is not something they ever did with the standard board game).
I would defintely recommend this inexpensive game for anyone looking to purchase gifts to put under the tree.
It is educational, helps students reinforce their spelling skills, and fun for all ages.
I love this game.
It was fun from the very first game I played.
It's really a neat concept.
You shuffle the tiles and they know when you have made a word.
In one game you make as many 3 to 5 letter words from the 5 letters you are given.
Time runs out and then the tiles tell you how many you made and the possible words.
The second game involves making a 5 letter word out of the 5 letters the tiles give you.
When you get it, the letters change and you try again.
Each time you get a few more seconds.
Time runs out and then the tiles tell you how many 5 letter words you made.
In the third game you play with multiple players and pass the tiles around.The game stores nicely in a hard plastic box.
I can't recommend this game enough.
I will be buying it as gifts for sure.Items to note:- Once in a while if you don't get the tiles lined up well it won't register the word- You can get freebies when the tiles get close and make a word- Sometimes if you select game 2 too soon it will start game 1- The case is really great.- It is a ton of fun
"I really like that Scrabble has been updated with modern technology (Scrabble dates back to the 1930s after all)and so a whole new twist on the game can be played.
There's no board now - just electronic tiles.
Players have 60 seconds to shuffle and slide their electronic cubes to create words before the time runs out!
Each of the five Scrabble Flash Cubes letter tiles has ""Smart Tile Technology"" so that each one recognizes the letters placed next to it, and automatically keeps score and checks if the word is spelled correctly.While traditional Scrabble fans will probably stick with the board game since a lot of the board strategies are no longer valid with Scrabble Flash (such as leftover tile strategies and double/triple word score challenges).
Scrabble Flash Game is great for casual play.
It provides a way for families to play together (with several 'challenges' aimed directly for family play) and parents can work on ways to make it age appropriate for all family members (e.g., under 8 need only to get 3 letter words, 8-12 have to get 4 letter words, and 13+ have to get 5 letter words).The game also provides a nice outlet for solitaire play - something the board game doesn't do that well.
You don't need a computer to challenge yourself any longer.These use 'coin' sized lithium batteries and don't look to use too much power, so I'd expect them to go a long time before you have to replace the batteries.In all, a very cool update of scrabble that is very portable and suitable for Scrabble enthusiasts as well as the casual family players."
"Are you a Scrabble lover?
Are you the only one in your household?
Better yet, have you been dubbed a ""smarty-pants"" and everyone refuses to play with you-because you always win?
If you responded yes to even one of these then you will love Scrabble's newest creation!
The packaging/box that it arrives in seems to be pretty useless which is a bit disappointing if you love to proudly display your board games on a shelf.
They make up for this by providing a little shiny black box case (3.5 inches long by 2 inches high) that holds the ""tiles"" safely and sleekly on a coffee table.Gameplay: LOVE IT!
I can now just pick up very quickly and start to make as many 3-5 letter words that my mental dictionary will allow in the alloted time.
Don't worry... the tiles have a built in timer and do not allow you to cheat!
There are 3 different version of either competitive or solo play; I have just preferred at this point to turn on the tiles and make words.
After the clock runs down, it will flash your points and the most possible points that could have been attained.
GRR!!
I am competitive and this has reminded me I have to get back in the Scrabble groove.As other's have noticed - while you are trying to figure out words you may get ""freebies"".
These aren't made-up words but rather part of the Scrabble dictionary.
Yes, there is a Scrabble dictionary and big Scrabble players own one.
That is one way to master this game... learn all the obscure words that wouldn't make sense in everyday conversations.I have found that very rarely it will not register a ""known"" word until I re-clink them again.
Not a big deal, but when I am in a word frenzy with a clock beating down on me....  You get my point; I LOVE SCRABBLE!Highly recommend, not only for Scrabble aficionados' but young children that have the ability to read.
