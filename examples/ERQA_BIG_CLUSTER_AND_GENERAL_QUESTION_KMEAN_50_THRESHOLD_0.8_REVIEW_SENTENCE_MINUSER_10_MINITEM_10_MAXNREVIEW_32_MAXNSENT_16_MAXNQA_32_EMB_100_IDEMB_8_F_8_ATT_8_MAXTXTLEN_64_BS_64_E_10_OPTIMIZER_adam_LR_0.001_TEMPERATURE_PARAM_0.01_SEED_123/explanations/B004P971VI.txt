Top sentence(s):
She is at that age where she loves baby dolls and being a mommy to them.
Thankfully, no... in fact of all the MLP toys they have, this is probably MY favorite, because it's big enough to cuddle, and doesn't seem so cutesy/fakey (&lt;don't ask me to explain that).
Be warned, this can happen at your house as well.My daughter has lots of stuffed animals, and while Pinkie Pie isn't directly a stuffed animal, it's close enough.
She says other phrases, too, like I Love You Mommy and Excuse Me.
For an adult, though, the toy is a bit creepy, because it ""talks"" in this high-pitch voice when it senses someone nearby, which has scared the pants off me a few times when I was walking around at night in the dark.

Reviews:
"This is a delightful toy.Let me start by describing the fact that the toy is in somewhat eco-friendly packaging.
Instead of using plastic tie-backs for the toy and for each of the accessories, the toy is tied back by paper  strings (which can then be recycled!
).The toy is for children 3+, but my niece is 1.5 years ago and is pretty advanced for her age - she can read the entire alphabet and says words like hippopotamus.
She was entertained by this toy for hours - she tried walking the pony (albeit not very successfully as the toy falls over if not held), she tried bottle feeding it (again, this requires more finite motor skills of an older child - you've got to stick the bottle right into her mouth and then push it out).
She could do all the other things successfully, however - feed it from a spoon, talk to it, hug it, play with it as with a doll.The toy and all the accessories are pretty durable.
The pony fell on the floor several times and was unharmed in the process.
The toy is made of a soft plastic head and mechanical legs, as well as some fibers for the hair.I especially liked the toy's educational value - the toy says phrases in what appears to be a completely random order, which is great.
There good phrases that teach etiquette, ""I love you, mommy"" (they have been trying to teach the kid to say that phrase for months, so it's great to have the toy teach it); ""Excuse me"" when the pony burps; etc.FYI: Make sure to switch the ""Try"" mode to the ""On/Play"" mode.
The ""Try"" mode can be trying at times - as the toy will speak any time you walk by it.
The ""On"" mode is great for playing and the toy will only speak in the ""On"" mode when  the hand is shaked.Bonus: The spoon makes an interesting conversation/gathering as my niece proceeeded to feed everyone with it.
A delight for the whole family!"
... she will be thrilled to open the box and play with this pony doll.
As a parent I was slightly disappointed by the extremely limited vocabulary but that's not a concern shared by my daughter.
The picture on the box shows the doll without a bow and one of the first reactions of my daughter was to try to remove it.
As far as attachments, there is a plate with mini spoon, a bottle, and a pacifier.
The doll itself seems fairly durable.
You have 3 settings for the talking: on, try-me and off.
The toy comes with batteries.
If you're for cuteness over interaction, go for this toy.
If you prefer interaction and learning, for roughly the same amount of money, go for the Playskool Alphie.Playskool Alphie.
"As a parent of two girls who both like MLP, I was prepared to hear the annoying and monotonous MLP theme song when we turned this on (I think I actually cringed in anticipation as I flipped the switch).
Thankfully, no... in fact of all the MLP toys they have, this is probably MY favorite, because it's big enough to cuddle, and doesn't seem so cutesy/fakey (&lt;don't ask me to explain that).
OTOH, I am not a 3 year old, either, so not relevant.This is unlike any of the tiny, hard plastic MLP figurines they have with exchangeable wigs and whatnot...more like a mutant MLP - a genetic cross between a human baby and pony (it walks upright, on two legs, people!
).So props for making a version of MLP that I have actually seen my girls ""cuddle"" and hug, like a real doll, if you will.
I think someone else mentioned that their kids didn't care at all about the walking function, and I will add that mine don't either.
In fact I have never seen them walk this doll anywhere.
When they play with it, it's part of a tea party, or one of many other ""friends"" in ""school"".Even in this modern day and age, I maintain that kids like their toys SIMPLE.
The extra gadgetry that is possible with modern technology is largely lost on my kids at least.
My kid will be as likely to turn all of her ""talking"" toys off and just hug them and put them in parades, as she will to be entertained by some robotic sounding voice or action.Overall, a good toy...maybe a little overpriced, but seems sturdier than most, and I actually think the walking thing is pretty cool (esp since we have a 10 month old in the house, doing the same thing!
), but my girls aren't much interested in that.
I do wish manufacturers would not put the TRY ME mode on the same switch as OFF and ON.
At least make it harder to push, or something.
a 3 yr old will probably not be looking at the switches to see which slot is ON and which is TRY ME since they are right beside each other.
And trust me, you will NOT like TRY ME once your kid leaves it in that mode.Recommended, if only for the doll aspect."
Young children of the female persuasion are usually the ones drawn to the My Little Pony brand of toys.
There are plenty of toys to choose from, and there are even a few that cater to the preferences of kids preschool age and younger.
My Little Pony So Soft Pinkie Pie is certainly one of them.
It takes the My Little Pony character and redesigns it to a toddler's preferences by making it cuter and more cuddly.My Little Pony So Soft Pinkie Pie is battery operated and the reason for the batteries is that this toy can talk.
Lift Pinkie Pie by the hand and pretend to help her walk and she will respond with: Look, I can walk!
Pretend to feed her and she will say: More please.
She says other phrases, too, like I Love You Mommy and Excuse Me.
The phrases are stated at random and each one is activated by lifting the hand.
However, make sure you don't leave the toy Try mode because if you do, it will talk whenever someone passes by.
Turn the control to the On position and it will only talk when the hand is moved.My Little Pony Pinkie Pie is made from plastic and that makes the toy basically unbreakable.
It can be dropped, thrown, etc., without worry.
The toy comes complete with the My Little Pony Pinkie Pie doll, a bottle, pacifier, bowl, and spoon.
The added accessories are great for the young mommies in your house who will enjoy playing with, feeding, and taking care of their little friend.
The doll is light so children of most any age can easily lift it and carry it around.
And the doll is very cute and babyish in appearance, which will add to its appeal to the young ones in the home.My Little Pony So Soft Pinkie Pie is a hit with both of my young girls and they rate it as an enjoyable toy.
They may not rank it in their top five, but they still like this toy and have not grown tired of it since it was introduced in our home several weeks ago.
This is such a cute pony doll.
Its really hard to find toys for kids in the 2 year old range, and this one is perfect.
Its big but not heavy, fun to hug and drag around, and has a hot pink tuft of hair that makes it so darn cute.
It functions the same as a realistic baby doll but instead is a cute big-eyed pony, which I seems to be more interesting to my daughter.
The accessories are really fun too, although I noticed the body of the baby bottle is painted which I'm not a big fan of.
I would give this doll 5 stars if it did a better job standing on its own as the flat feet make you want to walk with it all the time.
Other than that I think its a really cute, fun, and interactive toy that makes for lots of good playtime.
"We are big My Little Pony fans at our house--when you have young toddler girls this is probably par for the toy bin!
The two nana-toddlers love this pony and play with it constantly.
The pony talks and they laugh and laugh at some of the things she says.The three year old loves baby dolls and Pinkie Pie has become her favorite ""doll.""
She loves to feed Pinkie her bottle, put her to bed with her pacifier, and walk around with Pinkie in her stroller!If your kids like the My Little Ponies and Pinkie Pie in particular, then this toy will be a great addition to your collection.
But WARNING--My Little Ponies appear to be addictive--if your child doesn't have a pony yet, this could be the start of dozens of these ponies running around your toy bin."
"I believe this toy says for ages 3 years and up, but I think it's mostly for liability reasons.
Either way my 1 year old has enjoyed playing with it.We knew it would be interesting when the UPS said ""It's been talking to me"" when he handed us the package.
Apparently Pinkie Pie had been stuck in demo mode, and was babbling away.
Be warned, this can happen at your house as well.My daughter has lots of stuffed animals, and while Pinkie Pie isn't directly a stuffed animal, it's close enough.
She apparently also must posses something special because when my daughter see's Pinkie Pie, she exclaims ""PIE!
PIE!
PIE!
"", and then picks her up and gives her a hug.
She also figured out quite quickly that she can press her hand to make her talk.
However the bottle/pacifier require to much force for her to put in, and probably won't be able to to do it for a few years (it's quite hard for me to do it as well).
The walking portion doesn't seem to work all that well, the legs move, but you're basically just holding her up while the legs kind of propel it.
My daughter is too young to do that anyways.An older kid may be able to do a few more things, but the young ones will love this as well."
"My kids love this toy.
It's the perfect toy for playing ""mommy"" or ""daddy"" or ""big sibling.""
The toy gives the child feedback when the child, say, hold the toy's hand, thus encouraging the child to interact and develop.
For an adult, though, the toy is a bit creepy, because it ""talks"" in this high-pitch voice when it senses someone nearby, which has scared the pants off me a few times when I was walking around at night in the dark.
But at least the kids are getting tons of fun from teaching the pony to walk and eat and so on."
"I love this toy, which surprises me, since I don't tend to love talking toys.
The pony says ""I love you Mommy.""
I told my daughter, ""I love you, too, Katie"" and she said ""NO--*I'm* the mommy!""
What great training!
I love seeing my daughter practicing to be a mother.
And a mom can't hear ""I love you mommy"" in a sweet voice too many times in a day.
I think it makes me and my daughter both feel great.
The pony says she's hungry, and my daughter feeds her with a spoon and the pony laps it up.
It's just sweet.
She has a bottle, too.
My daughter adores it.
She can leave the sound off and just play with her like her other big size ponies.
I wish there was a volume or at least a ""low sound"" switch so her teenage sister could tolerate the play while she's nearby."
"I have 2 daughters, one is too old for this and the other is still an infant.
Toys in this category usually goes to my 3-year old niece.
We excitedly waited for this in the mail, when it finally arrived, my niece was all smiles and jumping up and down, can't wait to open the package.
It took an instant for my niece to fall in love with this toy.
She is now in the stage where she likes to ""take care"" of a sibling, in this case the My Little Pony Doll.
She immediately held it like it was a little sibling.
The fact that it ""talks"" adds to the sentimentality a little girl will feel towards this toy.
It comes with feeding accessories: pacifier and feeding bowl to stimulate the ""taking care"" effect more realistically.
It has made a tremendous impact on my niece.
It is a good training tool for her since she actually has an infant sibling.
Where before she has paid little attention to her younger sister, this doll has been instrumental in acknowledging the she has a sister.
Very, very happy to see the effect that this doll had in my 3-year old niece.
Very highly recommended!!"
"My daughter gets a big kick out of this toy.
She enjoys ""mothering"" the little pony and taking care of it.
She will talk to it and carry on a regular conversation.
I, on the other hand, would like to throw this little pony right out the window.
I want to believe that I somehow got a defective one, that they aren't all like this, but I don't know.
Our pony is extremely motion sensitive and will start talking if anybody so much as walks past it.
The pony will start talking and moving around when the cat bumps it in the middle of the night.....it's just irritating to me.
But my daughter loves it, so that counts for something."
"Those who are complaining about Pinky Pie talking constantly or being set off by motion, she's probably stuck on ""try me"" mode.
Open the velcro on her dress and flip the switch to ""off"" to have her be quiet, or ""on"" to have her interact only when interacted with, rather than constantly like she does in the demo mode.
Ours showed up as a ""talking box"" too, announcing ""hi, I'm Pinky Pie!""
before I'd even gotten the packing tape off, but it's easy to fix this once you have her out of the box.
My 3 year old LOVES Pinky Pie, and it is actually helping her with her speech exercises.
She loves giving Pinky Pie her bottle, feeding her, and brushing her hair.
At bedtime, I have her bring Pinky Pie over and I switch her to the ""off"" setting so she doesn't chatter at us all night long.
A great toy for a little one, and I actually don't find it obnoxious at all (and with three little girls running around, I am sensitive to excess noise!)"
"First of all, this toy is adorable.
I think any little girl would just love it.
It's a soft doll and it's pink and it's My Little Pony: what could be better?
But beware -- it can start talking all by itself!
When it arrived on my front porch, it was talking away.
My husband called me at work and said there was a box named Pinkie Pie on the front porch and it wanted to play.
He was completely befuddled, as he could not see the doll inside the box.
So if you are planning to buy this and give it away at a later date, switch it off ""Try"" mode (not easy, as you have to get your hand into a tight space in the box to do that) and/or take the batteries out of it, or they may run down without you knowing it.
Or the toy wake you up in the middle of the night."
My daughter loves her Pinkie.
She has been taking her everywhere she goes.She treats her like a baby doll.
The only problem about the doll is she do not say to much, I am ok with that but would like her to say more.
I like that I can get a washrag and clean her off.
The accessories are great beacuse no small tiny parts overall a great toy.
"I wasn't so sure about this toy b/c my daughter is not one that has ever gotten into playing with dolls (even ones similar to this that talk, etc.)
but she really likes Pinkie.
This ""horse"" looks nothing like a horse really, more like a weird kids with some kind of fro-hawk hair style and HUGE eyes.
That doesn't seem to matter to my daughter, she still calls her ""baby"" and loves to ""feed her"".Pinkie comes with 3 accessories, a pacifier, a bottle, and a spoon with plate, but they all do the same thing-when you put one in her mouth she makes a sucking sound and after a while either burps or says ""Thank you, Mommy"" in a sweet voice.
She has a hard, plastic head with wispy hair and a fabric covered body, which seems like it could be slightly problematic is you needed to wash her or wipe her down after a lot of use.The only other thing she does besides eat is when you squeeze her hand, she says ""Look I can walk"" and she moves her legs.
The problem with the ""walking feature"" is that she requires you hold her upright, so it's not really walking, it's more of a holding the doll up while she kicks her legs.
She doesn't know if she's actually standing up or not, so if she's laying down and you push her hand, she'll still talk about walking and kick her legs.
None of these ""con's"" seem to matter during play with my daughter.Overall, it's a pretty good toy, it's fun color and voice are engaging, but I could also see how losing the feeding accessories could be a problem after some serious playing.
It also doesn't do/say a large variety of things,  so I would say any child over the age or 3 or so would find her boring and redundant."
The colors are very vibrant, who wouldn't love this time.
They get to hold the hands/legs and teach her to walk, feed her with the bottle/bowl.
Just like having a real pet except all the other attention they need!
The doll is a pretend companion toy.
It can eat, walk, talk, sleep.
Can be brushed, dressed up.
My daughter uses it most to feed it, and is very happy when the doll coos and talks at that time.
My daughter is 4 year old, and she is now into human babies :) and has lost interest in this toy.
But if your child is a fan of my little pony kind of series, then she would enjoy it.
The material is once again good quality thick plastic and well made.
"My mom got this for my daughter.
My daughter simply enjoys it.
She is at that age where she loves baby dolls and being a mommy to them.
This one has a special twist.
Obviously it is not a baby doll for say, but it is a ""My little Pony"".
It also responds to her.
My daughter can feed it, and you can actually hear it eating off the spoon, drinking from the bottle, or sucking on the pacifier.
It burps and says ""excuse me"" and also asks for more.
It will even say that it is hungry, and my daughter promptly feeds it.
My daughter loves interacting with it and will usually respond to what the pony says, but I think her favorite thing to do is feeding her pony.Although it is not the most educational toy out there, it does help kids learn about taking care of something.
They can learn to feed and give a bottle.
It is at least a nice intro to being responsible without killing anything."
"My 9-year old granddaughter is into Webkins and American Girl dolls and loves the color pink.
And she adores Pinkie Pie.
Pinkie is larger than I expected, about the size of AG's Bitty Baby.
This a fun, durable doll with just enough accessories to keep it interesting but not too many to keep track of.
The voice is cute and says the typical talking doll phrases, ""I love you Mommy"", ""I'm hungry"", and ""Let's go for a walk"".
Pinkie Pie is easy for any chld to operate.
My 2-year old grandson gets a kick out of holding its hand and walking and talking with it.
Pinkie Pie is an excellent addition to any child's playtime menagerie."
"I really hate pink anything.
I also do not like the whole princess thing.
Unfortunately for me, those are the things my nearly 4 year old daughter loves most.
As a bribe to learn to swim, I told her if she did what the instructors told her for her lessons, at the end, I would give her a surprise.
That motivated her.
For 2 whole weeks, she looked at this toy and said, ""when Im done, I will get that"" and that she did.
She plays with it as though it were real.
Talking to it, and taking care of it.
She has other dolls but this is the only one she babies.
I give it 4 stars because I haven't found a volume button and this thing can be pretty loud."
My kids are My Little Pony fans and they fell in love with Pinkie Pie.
I couldn't even get her out of the box before they were playing with her.
She talks, walks and eats, has a mane that can be brushed, and has clothes that can be interchanged with those of other dolls we have.My three and five year old girls play with Pinkie Pie every day.
They like feeding her by putting the bottle in her mouth or using the bowl and spoon.
They also enjoy soothing her with the pacifier.
Mostly, they are just thrilled to hold her like a little baby and they work hard to make her happy.
They do not use the walking feature very much, but they laugh at and enjoy everything she says.Personally, I find the volume at which Pinkie Pie speaks to be slightly too loud and after hearing the phrases so many times, the doll has become annoying to me.
I keep quiet about my feelings though, because any toy that is this much fun for my kids is worth keeping.
Their joy means happiness for the whole family.
This seems to be a wonderful toy for young girls or anyone who likes to play with interactive dolls.
