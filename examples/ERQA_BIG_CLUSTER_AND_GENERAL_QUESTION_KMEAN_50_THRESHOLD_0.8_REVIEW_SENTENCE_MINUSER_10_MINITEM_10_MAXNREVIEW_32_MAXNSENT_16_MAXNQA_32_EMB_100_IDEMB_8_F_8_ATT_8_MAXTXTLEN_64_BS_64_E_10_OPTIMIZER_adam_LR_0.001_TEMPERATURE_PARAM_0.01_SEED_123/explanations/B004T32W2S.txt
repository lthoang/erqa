Top question(s):
Hi the side of this truck work for 1:18 figures?  (3 3/4)
What is the size of this truck.?
Top sentence(s):
I was happy to find that this toy can stand to my 3 year old's abuse.
"Truth in advertising: I'm 50 years old and my brother and I grew up with prized Tonka trucks and construction toys.
I like that it's plastic because it will be light enough for the 4yr old to carry around, and hopefully easy for the 14 month old to ""maneuver.""
"As soon as my grandson heard the noise of this truck he said it was Awesome!
The whole thing is made out of plastic so no major injury is going to occur if the truck accidentally rams into a piece of furniture (or a sibling).

Reviews:
I was happy to find that this toy can stand to my 3 year old's abuse.
I like the easy to find and use buttons and moving dump bucket.
Thus far the moving of the truck back and forth has lasted and so has the dumping mechanism.
I recommend this toy.Happy Shopping!
"The CAT motorized Job Site Machine will provide lots of creative play for any 3-4 year old child with a vivid imagination about construction.
The bright yellow heavy plastic vehicle has 6 operating buttons, allowing the truck to go forward/backward, raise/lower the bed, and play music/horn blowing.
The packaging has a ""try me"" feature which means 3 - 1.5v.
batteries are included with the toy.
If your child likes trucks, then this product will make a big hit."
My 3-year old was thrilled to get his hands on the truck, I loved that I could turn off annoying noises but that motorized features were still working.
The truck can lift and lower the bed and go about 6 feet forward or backward after pressing the corresponding button.
I am not sure the latter feature makes any sense, but my son loves it, and this is all that matters.
You really can't go wrong with a dump truck.
I've never met a little boy who didn't love them.
My nephew really loved this one!
He really enjoyed the back up and forward functions.
It's big and sturdy, perfect for hauling Xmen and matchbox cars around.
The color is bright and attention grabbing.
It was quite easy to remove from the box, there is a piece of plastic attatched to the bottom of the truck that simply snaps off to detatch it from the packaging.
This is a nice relatively sturdy plastic dump truck.
It's motorized.
Little buttons on the side allow you to raise and lower the back of the dump truck, as well as move forward and in reverse for a short distance.
Another button plays annoying rock music and a final one has an assortment of sound effects.
There is a switch to turn off the noise, but the motorized features still work.
This is a nice feature.
There is no remote control, which I personally prefer as it would just get lost.
My 4 yo son loves this truck, and several of his siblings enjoy it as well.I will say that I have never seen a toy so difficult to remove from the box.
It require a tiny Phillips screwdriver to unfasten multiple screws that had been used to secure the truck in the box.
I much prefer zip ties that you can just cut!
The Caterpillar DUMP TRUCK is just like your typical dump truck toy, but they've added a few sounds to it.
For play, it's been great and the boys have fun with it.
As a parent, the sounds get a little annoying.
(but really, what noisy toy doesn't get to a parent?)
To put it simply, it's a fun toy for the kids, but one I like having in the basement.
We love trucks that make noise and are animated at the touch of a button.
This dumptruck seems extra durable.
I love that it actually dumps the truck.
The sounds are great and just what you hear when you're around a real dumptruck.
Great for a toddler and/or young boy to play pretend with.
A great addition to any play construction collection.
"Truth in advertising: I'm 50 years old and my brother and I grew up with prized Tonka trucks and construction toys.
The Toystate Caterpillar Dump Truck hasn't broken - but there is no way it is as durable as the good old Tonkas.BUT - for the bells and whistles generation that is our grandson's, this excellent toy has some features far outdistancing old Tonka.There are two key features for a toy dumptruck - it must roll, and it must dump.
This machine does both at the touch of a button.
(How cool is THAT?)
Push a button - the dump bed lifts.
Another lowers it back.
One button starts the truck rolling forward, another puts it in reverse.
Sounds and lights enhance the effect.
The up-down-forward-reverse buttons are all on easy to read arrows.For children of the ""toy dump truck"" age - this truck and a backyard are all that are needed for hours of play.Enjoy!"
"My little guy is four and has been obsessed with construction, its machines and its tools since he was about two.
He was explaining to me the other day, quiet seriously, why the hydraulics in equipment had to be kept from freezing, and plans to be a builder when he grows up.
So this boy knows his construction toys and he really loves this truck.There are controls on the truck that allow the truck bed to be raised and lowered, allows the truck to drive a few feet forward or a few feet backwards, plays a tune, and flashes the headlights with some construction-foreman voice-over.
The truck is large enough that he can actually put blocks, Lincoln Logs, etc., in the truck bed and transport them around to his ""construction site"",  so it is actually useful.
The whole thing is made out of plastic so no major injury is going to occur if the truck accidentally rams into a piece of furniture (or a sibling).
It needs three AA batteries to operate the lights, sound and motion, with the average operating time for that type of power capacity.This is a nice toy.
It works well indoors and I would imagine that it would be fun outdoors.
The size is good and it does what it is supposed to do.
I think any child who is into building, tools, and heavy equipment will enjoy this one"
My four year old son loves construction vehicles and this was a hit with him.
The electronic controls are easy to figure out and operate; this is a toy that will require no assistance from adults which makes it nice.
I also liked that it came with the batteries.
Some other reviewers mentioned that it was loud but my son (who is usually very sensitive to loud noises) was fine with it.We have not taken it out into the sand box with his other construction vehicles just because I am afraid the sand will get all over the electronic parts and jam them up.
So instead of dumping dirt, he's been loading and dumping crayons and Lego blocks and he likes that fine.
The truck goes forward, backward and the dumper lifts up and down electronically.
It's not one of his favorite toys but he still plays with it often enough that I'll rate it among the better ones.
"I must admit right from the start, that I am reviewing this Toystate Caterpillar Construction Job Site Machines:  Dump Truck on examination only.
I plan on giving the truck to my grandson for his birthday two days from now, and I will definitely add a second review after he plays with it.
I have two grandsons, one 4 and the other, 14 months.
I'm hoping that both will be able to enjoy this truck.In my opinion, this truck seems sturdy, although it is plastic.
I like that it's plastic because it will be light enough for the 4yr old to carry around, and hopefully easy for the 14 month old to ""maneuver.""
I'm sure the 4 yr old will enjoy all the ""bells and whistles"" of the Dump Truck, including the electric lights and the motorized ""dumping"" action and wheels.
It makes sounds which is fun for kids.
I also like the open area in the cab.
It looks large enough for a small action figure or tiny animal to fit into.
This way the truck can have a ""driver.
""My 4 yr old grandson is very creative and builds lots of things and he seems to enjoy taking them apart and moving them to rebuild at another location.
I think this truck will be a lot of fun for him to use in his ""stories"" about the builders.I don't think I would recommend using this truck with dirt or sand due to the motorized parts, but for indoor play, it seems great.
I gave this toy 4 stars in all categories only because it hasn't really been used yet.
I'll be back with a report on ""customer satisfaction"" and durability."
My 3 1/2 year old loves all construction vehicles so I was excited to see this toy come up on the review list for Amazon.
My son likes the toy, but it wasn't as big of a hit as I expected.
As far as I can tell the main reason is how loud the music is.
It is LOUD.
So loud in fact that my son won't come near the toy until I've turned off the sound and demonstrated that pushing the buttons won't trigger the music.This truck has control buttons along the side that make it go forward/back and the bed to go up/down.
This feature is ok, but I think it's kinda odd that the buttons are on the truck itself instead of on a remote control.
Still, if your child likes motorized toys then this might be a neat addition.
For the most part my son ignores the buttons and prefers to manually push the truck around the house by leaning on the truck and zooming around behind it.
So far the truck seems to stand up to this pretty well, but I prefer it when he uses hisBruder Mack Granite Dump Truckfor this.
It's a sturdier truck (and much nicer to look at).
Yes it is $30 more expensive but well worth it in my opinion.
My sonsGreen Toys Dump Truckis also great for this kind of push play.Overall this is a good, standard dump truck toy with some extra bells and whistles, which can be hit or miss depending on your child.
"As soon as my grandson heard the noise of this truck he said it was Awesome!
The truck makes sounds, a man's voice says, ""back it up"" and the lights flash.
The dump bed works, up and down.
The truck goes back and forth.
Enough to keep the little ones happy.
My grand son just turned 6 today and he is having a great time with this truck.
His Dad hates toys with noise and I know that the mute button will be pressed soon.
The weight of the plastic is a little on the light side and I don't think this will hold up for too many seasons of play.
He loves it, I like it, Dad would rather it didn't make noise, but that's why the kids like to play at Grandma's house.
I especially like that it came complete with batteries!
Yes, an extra star just for that."
