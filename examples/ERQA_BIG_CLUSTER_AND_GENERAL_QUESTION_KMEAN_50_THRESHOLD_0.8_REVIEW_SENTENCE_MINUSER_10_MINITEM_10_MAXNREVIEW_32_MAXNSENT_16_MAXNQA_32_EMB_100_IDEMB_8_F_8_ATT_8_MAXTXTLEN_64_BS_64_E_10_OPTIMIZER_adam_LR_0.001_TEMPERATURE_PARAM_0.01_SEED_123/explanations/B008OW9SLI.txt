Reviews:
It was very clear after just five minutes of playing this game that our son wouldn't be asking to play it again.
It simply didn't keep his attention whereas we can play other card games over and over, often in rapid succession.
We'll keep it handy, but I don't anticipate he'll want to  play this more than one or two more times.
This game is sort of like hide and seek and works well for rainy days.
One person hides all the cards and the others get to collect them and match cards to their house.
Pets get hidden and then the kid has to find the pet that matches their randomly drawn house color.
If they find a pet that isn't the right color it is left hidden while the child continues to search for the right color pet.
It wasn't very entertaining for my husband and I to play but I think kids 5-9 might enjoy it.
I think kids a little older will find it boring or just not very fun without have a huge area to search.
(Parental guidance for the search area is needed - you wouldn't want to set this up where there are a bunch of breakable objects).
The memory aspect of this game can be a good learn tool for kids though.The cards are sturdy and seem durable.
The artwork is basic but cute and functional.We didn't like the two player variant.
My husband considers it so dumb it isn't even a game.
Both kids hide the pets and then go back and randomly draw houses and search for matching pets (which means you could draw a house with a pet you hid).
So the two player version might work for younger kids but when an older child learns how to cheat the game would be pointless.We both agreed that the more kids, the better the game and neither of us could see a reason that you couldn't buy two decks and player with even more then the box recommends.
(Although if there were that many kids, I may just make them play outside).
This game blends hide and seek with cards.
We recently had three rainy days in a row, and the kids had terrible cabin fever from being cooped up indoors.
We broke out this game and it kept them entertained for an hour.
The game comes with a deck of cards split into two sections - pets and houses.
You hide the pet cards around the room, then the players run around trying to match the houses to the pets.While it says to play the game in one room, my children are four and six, a little older than the recommended age, so we used the whole house to make the game a little more challenging.
They had fun with it, and asked to play it again the following day.
The color matching aspect is a great addition for younger players.It's fun, I imagine especially for younger players who may not yet be able to play board games or games that require more concentration or patience.
I&#8217;m always looking for a new game to get for my kids, since their attention spans aren&#8217;t always the longest and they can love something for a week and then become incredibly bored with it.
Pet Frenzied seemed like a really fun spirited game that would mix Hide and Seek with Memory and I thought for sure they&#8217;d love it.
This has had mixed results.
My eldest daughter loves it, because for her this is a lot easier to do, but my youngest just gets frustrated and yells at us.
Having the kids hide the cards is a no go, because they will cheat.
You have to hide them according to your audience, and while it can be fun for a while I found that a few minutes in my kids are already ready for it to be over.
This will probably work better in larger groups, where the kids are all the same age and so there will be no unfair advantages.
This is a super simple game!I've been using it with my 2 year old to learn colors and match them together.
He's especially fond of cats, so he was thrilled when he saw all the cats(and dogs) in this card game.
He likes finding a home for each of them.There is potential with this game to get more creative and more fun!
When I realized that the cards can be hid(really hid!
), the fun potential with this game went way up!
The way we've been using it was a little boring for my 5 year old, even if he would deal with it for brother's sake.
;) By hiding the cards, it becomes a combination of hide and seek and matching...with cards!It's a cute game!
This is the perfect snowstorm game when you have a bunch of kids inside going out of their minds with contained energy.
I've seen it played with kids ranging from 3.5 years to 8 years old, and although it's simple...it works!
Highly recommended.
Doesn't matter what I think about them or how well the game is designed.
All that matters is that the little one loves playing with these cards.
He has laid them out and sorted them and rearranged them for at least an hour a day since I gave them to him a month ago.I'm sure it's personal tasted but, for this child, it's a winner.
This is a fun card game.
One person hides the pets in a specified area and then the hiders pick a home from a pile and try to find the pet that it corresponds with.
So it is matching mixed with hide and seek.
It is more active than your traditional card game which is good for little ones that do not like to sit still for very long.
I think the game is more fun if you have at least 3 people because then one person can hide and the other 2 can seek.
Half your cards are house cards and half are pet cards.
You place the house cards face down.
Now you hide the pet cards around the area that you are playing at.
The players get a house card and try and find the hidden pet card that matches.The kids thought the seek n find part was fun.
It thought the hiding part was dumb and that it was better as just a matching game.I give it 3 stars since the kids did like it.
I don't seem them playing this again.
It's probably a pass for us.
I do think that a child that just likes to sit and play matching games would get use out of the cards.
This is an uncomplicated cards game that teaches children to find hidden Pet cards and match them with the same color House cards.
The rules are simple yet if the &#34;Hider&#34; decides to hide cards in places that are hard to find, examples: inside a book, underneath a sofa, inside a coat pocket that's inside a closet, etc., then the cards will never be found!
The main point in the rules is to hide the cards but with a small section visible.
My three and four year old nieces, and three of their pals had a fun time playing this game, but some of the headstrong kids will try to &#34;muscle&#34; their way to find the hidden cards.
Adult supervision may be required.
Made in the USA!
This is a very simple game sans a board that preschoolers and other young children will love.
It&#8217;s won not one, but three awards:  the Tillywig Sterling Fun Award 2013, theNational Parenting Center Seal of Approval award, and the Parents&#8217; Choice fun stuff award.
It&#8217;s an interactive hide and seek game that keeps little ones scrambling to find cards.There can be a little bit of excitement if there is a &#8220;Steal&#8221; with the last card.
The rules can be altered a bit and this part left out if you have a youngster with low tolerance for interference from other players.
If not, it can be a lot of fun.
Of course the child with the most Pets is the winner.

As soon as someone finds a match, this player goes back and grabs another House card and begins searching again.
The seeking goes on like this until all Pet cards have been matched to House cards, but watch out for a steal in the final moments.

At the initial read through of how to play the game, I did not think it was that great.
However, the fun is in the &#34;frenzy&#34; of finding the cards.
This game is essentially hide and seek with cards combined with memory.
There is one set of house cards and one set of pet cards in five different colors.
One player hides the pet cards in a room and then when he yells &#34;Pet Frenzied&#34;  then the remaining players grab a house card from the pile and runs to find a pet card that matches the color of their house card.
The game continues until all the pet cards are found.
I think it was the most fun with at least 2 but preferable three seekers.
It created a more fast paced and entertaining game.
The age range is 3-6, though even my 2 year old could play with her four year old brother because it is simple color matching.
The older the kids, the more I would hide the cards to increase the difficulty.
Pet Frenzied is a cleverly put together card game that challenges children to play an exciting game of hide and seek indoors.
There are game playing instructions for two player or 3 and more players, 13 pet cards & 13 home cards.
Each card is generously sized and feature either a dog, cat, or house.
The colors are bright and cheerful and the illustrations totally kid appealing.
I also found the durability of each card to be top notch.The game is geared for children ages 3 and up and for 2-6 players.
My husband and I set up a few rounds of Pet Frenzied for our 3 year old son and 5 year old daughter.
Since their first time playing, they've been asking when they can play again.
My son literally was in tears when we told him game time was over.
I guess if that's not proof in how much fun this game is, I'm not sure what is.How the game basically works is that you'll first need to pick a designated area to play.
We chose our living room.
Both players ( or mom or dad) start out as the hiders of the house cards.
After all the house cards are hidden, the players become seekers to find a color match of the pet card in their hand that they pulled off the face down pet card  pile on the table.
Whoever has the most matches at the end wins.
It's pretty simple but the kids love it!
You can also up the challenge by hiding the cards in more hard to see places.My favorite aspect of the game is that it gets my kids moving, especially during the rainy and cold days when going outdoors is somewhat out the question.
This game teaches the kids about good sportsmanship, matching colors, and it improves their memory skills.My kids are very engaged when we play!
This card game is perfect for kids who are into pets.
However, my son (who adores animals) played with the cards by himself a lot longer than he played the game with us.
Besides just the game, the cards can be used in many different activities with younger kids, like recognizing pets, colors, house types, and pet sounds.
The active language play can also be explored with the homes involved like, &#34;What is the house like, what color is the door, who do you think lives there, where is the house,&#34; etc... My son also liked playing on his own as a memory game and with us as a &#34;go fish&#34; variation.The cards are good quality and have cute cartoon pets and houses on them.
It's an easy game to grasp for little kids and could even be used for babies if you are doing early-start education.
I think older kids... 7-8-9-10 will find this beneath them.
They might play, but they will lose interest quickly.
This game was rather complicated.
I thought it was going to be like a memory game, but it was really a hide and seek but the players hide the pet cards, instead of themselves.
It was kind of a busy game, more complicated than it needed to be.
The children played it one weekend but have only played solitary memory games with it after.In the two-person game the 5 different color house cards are put out on a flat surface and the 5 different color pet cards are mixed up and hidden by both players.
(Supposedly with one part sticking out.)
Then both players come back to the beginning point and pick up a colored house and try to find a pet of the same color.
This should not be difficult because they just hid them.
Come back for a new house, find a pet that matches the same color.With 3 or 4 player games, one person does the hiding and the others look.
This corrected a lot of the flaws of the two player game because they didn't actually know where the cards were hidden.The graphics on the cards are pretty and bright and well done.
The colors are bright and easy to find.Instead of using card stock, these cards are made out of two layers.
I had a card separate even as I took the plastic off from the pack.
the class loves the idea of the game.
They caught on quickly how to play.
We love to play games in the room and I had children standing by the table waiting for their turn.
I love that is all a simple deck of cards so easy for set up and most importantly to store when we are done.
The Pre K world really liked this game.
The first few times my daughters played this game, they enjoyed it.
It lost it's appeal fast though.
I'm thinking they're just too old for it as it's pretty much a matching game and they're nine.
You hide the cards throughout the house and then go through finding matches.
I think it would be a great party game for younger kids.
I used this at a party with a range of ages and wasn't sure how it would work out.
The youngest child was 4 and the oldest was 12.
The cards look a little babyish, best for the age group shown, but I wanted something other than video games to keep the kids busy.
I had the older kids take turns hiding the cards, while the younger ones did a mad dash to find them.
At first the &#34;concept&#34; was a little tricky and I had to re-read and re-explain everything.
But once we ran through it a couple times, then we had no issues.
I really like this game, because the cards are larger than a deck of cards and they feel really sturdy.
I love that it's something that will get the kids out of their seats and moving.
It is fun to hide them in a couple different rooms and then let the kids run around.
I have also used these to keep my 9 yr old busy, as I will hide them, then set a timer and have her look for them.
Anything that keeps kids active is a great toy.
And then anything that doesn't require batteries or too much space makes it even better.
I am pleased with this game and think it's something we will keep handy during the winter months.
Pet Frenzied is a game for kids that uses cards.
The gameplay is very simple, as expected for a recommended 3+ age, but makes little sense to anyone older.
The instructions are slightly different for 3+ players vs. 2 players, but in both situations 1-2 players hide the 13 pet cards (composed of 5 colors), yell &#34;Pet Frenzied&#34; (why not &#34;frenzy?&#34;) and then players take a card from the 13 house cards (again 5 colors) and search for a pet with the same color as the house they drew.
Players who find a match draw a new house card and this continues until all pet cards are found.
Note that once the cards run out players without a house card left can &#34;steal&#34; a house card from another player if they find the matching pet card first.
At least this last rule allows you to find out which of your kid's friends not to invite back for another play date.The cards are thick enough not to wear out too quickly and large and bright to make them easy enough to spot, though they are difficult to shuffle.
The gameplay gets old quick for anyone over 5 years old and there is not much educational about the game.
Still, my 3 year old did get a kick out of the game and has asked to play it several times.The hide and go seek mechanic is widely used in other kids games these days.
I find the Fly and Go Seek game to be much better overall, though it appeals mostly to girls.
Wow, this was great fun for my two girls.
They had ablest hiding the cards from one another and then dashing to see who could make the most matches first!
As an adult, it was also a mad dash to try and beat them (little ones have great memories, don't they?
).The instructions do need a little bit of re-reading to fully understand the concept, but once you get past that hurdle you'll have fun with this card game.
Bonus - easy to travel with this!
I don't know how you win an award for a &#34;game&#34; of matching cards, of which there are only about a million variations avaiable in teh marketplace.
The &#34;neat idea&#34; is to use them as a &#34;hide and seek&#34; sort of thing, which tends to result in lost cards, and which obviously you could do with any old regular set of cards too, but hey, who am I to think outside the box.
The cards are of normal quality - not paper flimsy and not peeling apart or anything; but not real heavy or anything either.
All in all, my kids really enjoy card matching and hiding/seeking, so these are a hit: Thumbs up!
But not all that unique.
Pet Frenzied is a good game for younger audiences.
I played this game with my 4 and 6 year old kids and they enjoyed it, although they definitely enjoyed it more when playing with a larger number of friends.
The game is simple - match a pet to its house as quickly as you can.
My two kids found this game fun, although I found that they got bored with the game after two hands.
With more kids playing and looking for the cards, the game got much more competitive and therefore fun.
I can't imagine older kids finding this game particularly appealing (especially since those cards are super cute in a &#34;little kid&#34; kind of way), but only time will tell.The cards are brightly illustrated and look very cute.
The card stock is good, and is on par with a deck of playing cards.
This would be a good stocking stuffer for any young pet lover.
This is a fun game and even the younger ones can enjoy it which is great it is mostly for them actually older kids not so much.
They will have fun while working on matching/memory ect.
You hide the pet cards and seek them out with the matching home cards until all are found/matched.
I only wish the cards were sturdier thats not to say they are flimsy there not...but considering the kind of game it is and the audience it is for something thicker/stain proof or with a sealer/cover of some sort would be great.
Fun game nice mix of hide/seek and memory ;o)
"""Pet Frenzied"" is an excellent game for the family to play together.
At its core it is a slightly modified version of Hide-and-Seek.
Instead of hiding yourself though, you hide cards.
On each of these cards is an animal and it is color-coded to a ""house"" card.
You divide the cards into ""Pets"" and ""Houses"" and then you take the ""Pets"" cards and deal them amongst all players.
The players then hide these cards throughout an area designated as the play area.Once all of the cards are hidden, everyone yells ""Pet Frenzied"" and they grab a ""house"" card from the deck.
From this point on, you look for the matching ""Pets"" card and build a pile as fast as you can.
The winner is the person with the most pets.It's a simple little game, but it kept my kids busy for hours.
They loved hiding the cards from one another and then dashing across the room to try and find the right ones for each house.
Not only does this game makes kids think, it gets them moving as well, and that's something that few card games can do these days.Highly recommended."
As a mom, you are always looking for new ways to interact and encourage your kids to play.
This is a fun game, especially designed for younger kids - about age 3-6 - that gets them thinking, moving and happy.
It's a combination of hide and seek and match-ups.
The cards are fun, colorful and add a learning element of colors to the learning experience.
I can't say that it is thrilling over an over but many little kids games are hard to keep the adults entertained.
It's all about watching your kids have a good time.
To me this game was just a bunch of pointless chaos.
But having said that, the kids loved it!
Basically two children play.
Each hides 1/2 the animal cards and then they pick up house cards one at a time and have to rush to find the matching animal card for each house one at a time.
They are matching colors.
Lots of running around which suits them just fine because they love working themselves into a frenzy.
This is not a quiet card game and I think that's what appeals to them most.
I think I will buy this for all my friends' kids.
The Pet Frenzied Kids Card Game is great for little kids to test their memory skills.
It comes with twenty six hide and go seek cards that you hide throughout the room.
The animals are cute and it keeps them interested and motivated to play.
It is a simple game and the kids have to match the card colors.
It is quick and easy to play for toddlers that like to hide and seek and like cute animals.
Pet Frenzied is not a traditional card game, but rather a cross between a matching game, hide & seek, and a scavenger hunt.
The players draw a building card and then search for the same color animal card that has been hidden in the room.The illustrations are just adorable!
There are 5 colors but only 26 cards.
I think it would only cost a few cents to double the number of cards.
This would not increase the complexity but it would increase the amount of time it takes to play the game.
As it is, only making the cards very hard to find can extend the fun beyond just a few minutes, and then the little ones get frustrated.The suggested age range of 3-10 is quite generous;  I would say this game is more appropriate for 2-5 year olds.
If the children are old enough to match colors, grasp the cards, and toddle, they are old enough to play.
If they are old enough to write, they are probably too old to be interested.The deck could also be used for a simple game of matching colors or cats-to-cats or dogs-to-dogs.
It would also be fun at a birthday party if prizes were awarded to each child upon finding the matching card.
These are large, brightly colored cards.
The instructions are easy to understand.
The kids enjoy playing with them, which is the most important thing.
Cards could be a bit more durable.
My 4 & 7 yr old girls were so excited when they saw the cute pictures on these cards.
However, the game itself is severely lacking in many ways.
The instructions and object of the game was hard for me to decipher.
The game was so short and pointless that even my daughters thought there had to be more to it.
I checked, re-read, nope that was it.They played a few more minutes, making up their own game....and that was it, no interest shown again.
I was thinking with them being dog and cat fanatics they may revisit it or make up their own game (as they do often with other games) but that wasn't the case.
bought this for my great nephew who is two and he loves animals, my niece reported that he really loves this game matching the pets etc,  and they've had a great time playing it over the few days they've had it during the bad weather we've had so she was glad it was something fun that they could play over and over and keep the kids entertained.. i'm so glad it was a hit!
i recommend it on this basis.. very happy great nephew.
This game is cute, and has several ways to play it.
I enjoy a game that does that.
It generally will keep kids coming back to it.
I don't like the hide and seek part of it.
I find us still finding cards.
My kids attention is quickly lost.
It is also for younger children only.
The older ones had no interest.
If I had to recommend a game other than this, it would be spot it.
Much more fun, several ways to play, and appeals to older children as well.
