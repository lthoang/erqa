Top sentence(s):
You roll a die that has colors and if one of the three chicks on your ""line"" match that color you toss it on the coop and then keep rolling the die until you don't have a color match and on to the next player.
We also place the chickens on the coop.
It took so long to get through the chickens that my granddaughter, who I got the game for, was bored and had stopped playing.The first few times that the coop popped up and chickens flew was fun and exciting for her.
It is mainly a speed/dexterity thing which makes it hard for younger children to play against an adult.The point of this game is to roll a dice and throw the matching color of chicken onto the roof of the chicken coop before the coop pops up and throws the chickens everywhere.
While you wait you roll a color coded dice and you take that color chicken and try and toss it up on the coop.

Reviews:
"This says 4 and up on the box and the description makes it sound pretty simple.
Just chuck rubber chickens at the coop.
Then you read the instructions.Each player takes 9 randomly colored chickens.Arrange them so you have 3 you are allowed to chuck and 6 in reserve.Push down the coop until it clicks.First player rolls the die, chucks a chicken only if one of his first 3 match the color.Moves a chicken from reserve to the front line and rolls again or passes the die to the player on the left who next has a chicken in his first 3 that matches the color.Continue around the table until the coop pops.Player who has the die takes 3 of the flying chickens to add to his reserve and puts the rest out of play.Push down the coop again and keep going until someone chucks all of his chickens.Here are the problems we had with this game:1) Coop pops up very fast.
We timed a few and got a 15 second average.2) Cheap plastic die bounces around on the table for at least 2 of those seconds every roll.
(The one in the picture looks wooden to me, but the one in the box was hollow black plastic.
)3) Kept forgetting to move a chicken from the reserve before rolling the die.4) You cannot actually ""chuck"" the chickens as they are rubber and will bounce right back off.5) The coop popped up at least 5 times before we even managed to get more than 3 chickens on top.
At that rate, no one will ever run out.6) Chickens regularly fly off into our reserve pile and leave us confused as to how many were on top.We simplified the rules to say you could ""chuck"" any of your 9 chickens and always passed the die to the left regardless of who had which colors.
Then it was almost a game.
I'm glad we didn't pay for it though."
"Parents will love this low-tech game because it does not require batteries, screwdrivers or a long instruction manual.
This game goes from box to play in under a minute.The object of the game is to ""chuck your chickens"" on top of the chicken coop.
The chicken coop pops up at unexpected intervals.
When the coop pops up, you get stuck with the chickens that pop off.The chickens are different colors, and everyone starts with nine of them in a mix of the colors.
You line up three of your chickens in a row, in line with the coop.
The youngest player rolls the chunky brown color cube to determine which chicken gets chucked onto the coop.The trick is that you have to work as fast as possible so the coop does not pop during your turn.This a fun preschool game for reinforcing colors, counting up to ten, and taking turns."
"This is a pretty good game for something different for younger children to play.
I think they might become bored if the game was played too frequently, but I like the concept and I think children will like the bright colors and the idea of putting the chickens back on the coop.The game's good points:* No assembly required* No batteries needed* Good for 2 to 4 players* Quick-paced game with several rounds* Even if you are way behind your opponent in getting rid of your chickens, you can still comeback and win* Ideal for kids ages 6 to 9* Could teach colors to younger children* Good for two players as well as 3 or 4* Faster paced with 3 or 4 players which would be good for older children, but possibly confusingfor younger ones.
* Unique conceptThe not so good points:* Spring on the chicken coop doesn't seem like it will be very durable* Older children would quickly become bored by the game* Not good for households with toddlers because the chicken game pieces are very small* You don't actually ""chuck"" the chickens on top of the coop, because they would fall right off.
* Only comes with 36 chickens, which is the exact number needed to play the game with 4 players.It seems like the pieces would be easily lost.
We put ours in our own zipper bag* Younger children may be confused by keeping track of the front row of 3 chickens to play from and a back row of ""reserve"" chickens that are moved up as the chickens are placed from the front row"
Cluck N Chuck is a cute game that young kids (but not too young or too old - read on) will likely enjoy.
Gameplay involves each player taking 9 chickens and attempting to get rid of those chickens one by one by rolling matching colors on the die.
Chickens are discarded onto the spring-loaded roof of the included coop, which will pop up & launch the chickens after a short while.
Whoever is in play when the coop launches must put some of the chickens back into their stash.
First one out of chickens wins.The main issue with Cluck N Chuck is the limited age range that to which it will likely appeal.
I got this with my 3 year old daughter & 7 year old son in mind.
Given their age & developmental differences it's a bit tough to find games that interest both of them.
Due to the relative complexity of the gameplay (players begin with 3 of their 9 chickens in play and 6 in reserve, and must manage these two groups seperately) and the need to work quickly to succeed, this one ended up appealing more to the older than the younger.
The game is recommended for 4+ and it is certainly a bit fast & complicated for my 3 year old, enough that she became frustrated when we tried to play by the official rules.
My 7 year old had no problem understanding it, but once the novelty of the launching chicken coop wore off he lost some of his initial interest.
Though it is reasonably fun for him, this game has less repeat value than more complex & strategic games like Monopoly, Sorry, or Battleship, all of which he enjoys more than this one.In the end I'd recommend this game but for a fairly narrow age range, something like 4-7.
Of course your child's developmental abilities and interests may stretch that range either way, but those too young may be turned off by the difficulty and those too old by the lack of strategy & decision making involved.
But for the right kids, this cute game with the unique launching element is certainly worth a look.
"My son had more fun playing with the little chickies after we put the hen house away than he did with the actual game.
There is a die, multi-colored chicks, and a hen house that ""springs"" to life.
It is fun to kids when the hen house pops and all the chickies pop off, but it is short lived.
It's a very fast game, so three pops and they are ready to put it back in the box.
The instructions are rather confusing for kids to understand, so I spent half the time reiterating the rules until the kids just grabbed it from me and went to play where they didn't have to follow rules.
They played with the toy for about twenty minutes (mostly just lining up the chicks and fighting each other) and then it went back in the box.
It rarely comes out anymore.I think simplifying the rules might make this more fun for kids, but not sure how much more fun it can be when the novelty of the ""springing"" hen house wears off."
Making toys must be tough.
How do you compete with all the electronic toys that beep , boop and kill things ?This is a simple game that kept the nieces and nephews entertained for about an hour , and then it was back to the latest game system their parents bestowed on them.The kids did return to it a couple of hours later , so that's a good sign.
I have twin 6 year-old daughters, and they love the Cluck N' Chuck.
They want to play with it almost every day, and beg me to play with it.
Who knew?The game itself is pretty simple, there are a bunch of rubber chickens, a colored die, and a chicken coop.
You push the chicken coop down, and at some random point it pops up flinging the rubber chickens everywhere.The point of the game is to roll the die, and chuck a corresponding colored chicken on top of the coop.The action is fast, so kids have to focus and react quickly.
From that perspective, I would consider the game educational - more of a training the attention thing.Within a day of playing, the kids are already better than I am.
And because game play is quite fast, you can play numerous games, switching who goes first, etc.
Also, the kids aren't really focused on who won or lost as much as moving on to the next game.
I got this game through the Amazon Vine program to review.
I played it with my 5 year old son and husband.
It was an okay game, but got pretty boring after a few plays.
There really isn't much skill or thought involved.
It is mainly a speed/dexterity thing which makes it hard for younger children to play against an adult.The point of this game is to roll a dice and throw the matching color of chicken onto the roof of the chicken coop before the coop pops up and throws the chickens everywhere.
A player gets to roll the dice until he runs out of chickens that match the color he rolls and then the dice goes on to the next player... rinse and repeat.The pieces of the game are nice quality.
The chickens are made out of a dense rubber that allows them to stick to the roof of the coop fairly well when thrown.
Then coop is pushed down at the start of the game and then slowly ticks away until is pops up again.
It kind of reminds ofPerfectionbut you are throwing chickens instead of putting shapes in their place.
Basically the person who wins is the one who can roll the die the fastest and throw the chickens the most accurately.My son got a kick out of the coop flying up and throwing the chickens everywhere.
My husband and I thought the game was just plain stupid.
It doesn't require thinking, strategy, or even teach anything about couting or reading.
It is pretty much pure stupid short-lived fun.After playing it two or three times my son got bored with it and my husband and I were grateful to put it away.
Since the first time we've played it I've tried to get my family to play it a couple more times and no one wants anything to do with it.Overall it's a well made game but a bit stupid in principle.
A group of kids might have fun throwing the chickens around and watching them fly all over the play.
I definitely wouldn't recommend for adults though.If you are interested in a game like this I would recommend Connect 4 Lauchers over this one.
I got this on a whim, thinking it wouldn't be enjoyed by my God Son's too much, but I was wrong.We pulled this out, and they LOVED it, they couldn't stop laughing, every time the coup pops up and the chickens fly off!
I honestly still don't understand how you win, but they really don't care.
They are 2 and 5yrs and we use it more as a tool to teach them color recognition, and it is actually really good for that, because they want to put the chickens on to watch them fly.
It has been perfect for my older God son who has some learning issues.
:)Not a complex game, but it is really fun for younger children because of the random coup jumping, and the anticipation that the chickens are going to fly, it is worth the price alone to watch my kids laugh and squeal with delight every time it pops!God Bless ~Amy
This game was ok as far as being a fun game for my kids to play.
However, after a few times playing it, they bored of it right and went on to something else.
They haven't pulled it back out to play again either.
I also lost a few of the little chickens already too because little hands lose little game pieces.
The game does haven't much for educational value, except learning to take turns and understanding concepts of how games are played.
I think I'll give it a little bit and try to pull it out again and see how the kids like it later.
Maybe it was introduced at the wrong time (i.e.
Christmas season when everyone is giving them new toys).
I'll update if anything changes.
The one thing that I didn't like is the timer because my kids stress out with timed things.
Not really a game for kids who have issues with being timed or feel stressed by a timer (like 2 of my kids do).
"The best thing about this game is simplicity.
You can start playing straight out of the box.
Not many rules for the little ones, fast play, and easy revisions to the basic game make it appealing for all age groups.
I'll take this over Chutes & Ladders or Candyland ANY day!
There are really only two components; a spring loaded chicken coop, and a flock of colorful chickens.
(Big plus for me was the tactile feel of the chickens.
They're a semi soft rubbery feel as opposed to that cheesy hard plastic.)
You push the coop down to set it, then take turns placing the chickens on the roof before the coop pops up.
I bypassed the official game for my two grandkids at first.
They are 1 and 3, with short attention spans.
We just tried to put all the chickens on the coop before it springs.
This resulted in a lot of giggles and a much longer playing time than I expected.
Later, they also played this game together without an adult to officiate.
It was fun to watch them working together to ""beat the clock"" instead of playing against each other.
Since the game doesn't have to take much time, everyone was happy to participate when they asked other family members to play with them on several occasions, making this their first choice for a family game session.
We then tried out some different variations, working on color selection for the one-yr-old as well as counting skills with both kids.
Thankfully you don't actually 'chuck' the little plastic chickens.
(Of course that made my 7 and 9 year olds a little bummed out.)
You place the chickens on top of the hen house and roll until it pops up tossing the chickens.... back into your pile, leaving me to figure out who's chickens are who's.
Yay, I'm a chicken referee.The directions were a little complicated, and a lot annoying because I have to continually monitor the action so no one is 'cheating'.
Yay again, I'm still a chicken referee.After a few pops they are done, and I am hanging up my whistle done.Maybe if they were younger, but even then I'd have to continually watch the action if they were playing to play.It's a cute idea, and maybe for some younger kids it would be fine, for me it's a pass.
The game is cute, simple and seems well made.
I found it to be a silly, fun addition to game night - love games where the anticipation of and eventual launching of pieces has everyone squealing.
My 12 year old was only mildly interested, but thought the chickens were cute.
My 7 year old was much more interested in playing, but got frustrated when she couldn't get many chickens to stay on the coop.
If your kids will stick with it long enough to get the knack of tossing the chickens, it is cute.
"This game is a lot of fun for my 5 year old and we've played it about 10 times in about a week and a half.
Essentially, you push down on the coop and each person gets 9 chickens (randomly picked) and three go in a ""line"" away from a pack.
You roll a die that has colors and if one of the three chicks on your ""line"" match that color you toss it on the coop and then keep rolling the die until you don't have a color match and on to the next player.
When the coop pops up, whoever's turn it was, has to take three of the chicks and add to the pile.
And the game continues.
Whoever runs out of chickens wins.PROS:-Quick thinking--match the die color to the chicken in your line quickly and add to the coop before it pops!-Learn how to take turns-not complicated-suspense with when the coop with ""pop""-simple game to learn.
I instructed him as we played the first few times but he quickly got it.
I recommend it for 4+-The pop seems to happen at least after a few minutes, which is great when you have little ones needing more time to react and understand how to play the gameCONS:-I wish there was a way to unset the coop.
If you press down and decide you aren't ready to play you have to wait for it to pop.
That could take minute or two-there doesn't seem to be  extra chickens.
they are small and could get easily lost.
4 ppl can play, but I think they provide just enough chickens for 4 people.-be careful not to play with very little kids as they may swallow the small chickensOverall it's cute and simple and not a lot of pieces or a big bulky board, which is fantastic."
This was absolutely fun playing with my five year old.
Before I knew it the whole family got together and was trying to see how many chickens we could get to stay before it popped up.
You push down the chicken coop and you have a certain amount of time before it pops up.
While you wait you roll a color coded dice and you take that color chicken and try and toss it up on the coop.
You try and get rid of all your chickens before the coop bounces up and knocks off your chickens.
My little one laughed and couldn't wait for it to pop up so the chickens would all fall off.
It was a fun time playing this game.
It was also an easy game that helped teach him his colors.
No batteries are needed and as long as you play on a solid surface with lots of room for the chickens to be bounced onto it is a great time of fun disquised as learning.
My oldest who is ten wanted to play with him and he certainly enjoyed her playing this game with him so I considered it a sucess.
I hope you enjoy it as much as my family does!
"The idea behind this game seemed simple until I read the instructions.
They are really confusing and definitely not something a child would easily understand.
Basically, everyone gets 9 colored rubber chickens.
A player rolls a ""die"" and if they have the color of chicken that shows up on the die, they can chuck them on top of the coop.
Play progresses until the coop pops up and chickens go flying.
The problem was that the coop popped up almost immediately.
One player could barely throw 3 chickens before it popped up.
It took so long to get through the chickens that my granddaughter, who I got the game for, was bored and had stopped playing.The first few times that the coop popped up and chickens flew was fun and exciting for her.
Be sure to play on a large surface, or on the floor because the chickens really go flying when the coop pops up and you will be looking under and around the table for them.The game seems to be pretty durable.
My nephews were playing with us and they would sometimes push the coop down too hard, but it held up fine.I think this game is fun for only a short while, and then it is just the same old thing every time.
My granddaughter had more fun playing with the little rubber chickens than she did the actual game.Be aware that the rubber chickens present a choking hazard for young children.
That's another reason to play on a surface where you can keep track of all the chickens as they fly off the coop.I really can't recommend this game."
I got this with a 4 and 6 year old in mind.
They loved it for a while, then got bored and moved on, but play it at least one time when they visit.
Of course we made up our own rules.
The coop seems to pop fairly quickly so no one as time to get their chickens all on.
We changed it so all 9 of everyone's chickens are in play (you are supposed to have 3 on the line with 6 on reserve).
We pass the dice around the circle, not by who has the proper color chicken.
We also place the chickens on the coop.
While chucking them was a lot funnier, they bounced (they are rubber) so no chickens stayed on the coop.
Once the giggles of chucking were over, we went with placing.
Interest was only held for a short while, but was good to play with older siblings involved, as a family game.
Remember the Jack in the Box toy?
Remember waiting for the music and crank to come around so the Jack jumped out?
Well, that toy gave a warning, and even when the child knew it was coming, it was still a fun surprise.So this Cluck 'n Chuck is built along the same lines with the popping out surprise, only you don't know when it is coming!
It is great fun!The idea is to get rid of all the chicks before anyone else.
Players take turns rolling the die and matching the color on the die to the color of chicks in his or her pile, putting chicks on the roof of the house, and passing to the next player.
When the house pops up with no warning, the player with the die must collect extra chicks!
Play continues until someone is out of chicks.This game is very educational for ages 4 and up - pre-school age.
They have to count out the number of chicks to start with, they have to recognize primary colors and match these, they have to manipulate the correct color of chick to the roof of the house, they have to take turns, share, and then learn to act quickly.
Excellent for counting, color recognition, socialization, and small motor development.This is also a fun game to share with older children and grown ups.
It can be a family game and so much fun since you don't  know when the house will pop up and scatter chickens everywhere!The spring in the chicken house is fully enclosed so no small fingers can get to it.
It is made of durable, hard plastic and you can't see the spring action - so no warning when it will pop.
The only suggestion I have is to use a zip lock kind of bag for the pieces and store them in the box so they don't get lost.
The chick pieces are small, so this game needs to be kept away from young children still putting things in the mouth.Just an excellent game!
