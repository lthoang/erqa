Reviews:
"This Bloco Toys Robot Invasion set is a lot of fun and lets kids stretch their imaginations!
We own a small business and keep toys on hand to entertain children while their parents shop, so we added these to the mix.The foam pieces have to be removed from the sheets they were stamped out of, but that only took a few minutes.
Once all of the pieces are out you can build the ""robots"" shown or use your own imagination to build truly unique creations.This is not meant for very small children due to the small piece sizes, but these are a lot of fun and quite clever.Recommended!CFH"
This set comes with 225 pieces total and they are a mixture of foam pieces and plastic connector pieces.
It also comes with a full page color step by step guide that makes it a piece of cake to build each of the six different types of robots.
There are enough pieces to build five different robots at once but not all six.
Most people could probably build any of the robots in about ten minutes or less.
Of course if you would prefer then you can just make up your own robot.
The foam pieces aren&#8217;t made of foam that will break apart and make a mess.
This foam is soft but durable and doesn&#8217;t break at all or make a mess.
It&#8217;s also easy to clean with a damp cloth or sponge if any of the pieces get dirty.
I don&#8217;t see any way that a young child could get hurt with these other than choking on them if they were to put these in their mouth.
These are recommended for children between the age of four and ten years of age.
In my opinion I would say more like three or four years old to eight years old.
I think they are pretty easy and fun to build.
They also look very cool once complete.
However you really can&#8217;t play with them much without something falling off or apart.
It&#8217;s more of creative toy to build and to display them than a toy for the purpose of playing with.
Overall I think they are cute and good for young children.
I liked this Bloco Toy Robot and think it is actually pretty cool.
There are a lot of foam pieces and you can get pretty creative in building it.
They are safer that Legos and dont hurt your feet when you step on them by accident.
It was pretty fun to build once you pop all the foam pieces out.It took me a bit of time to build, but was worth it.
I really like the unique look.
A boy or girl can enjoy this as it is not very gender specific.I would definitely pick this set up.
It is a good compliment to other building sets and offers loads of fun.
I would recommend this.
"Bloco Toys ""Robot Invasion"" is a good choice for those who are patient; like craftwork or constructing models or puzzles; and who do not prefer to create their own designs.
Constructing the robots requires some manual dexterity and fine motor skill since the high-density foam pieces must be ""punched"" out of a foam sheet and can be easily damaged.
Further, because the ""Robot Invasion"" characters are constructed of numerous small pieces, one might want to have a dedicated area on which to build the robots.The colorful robot invaders are assembled according to the pictorial directions included in the package; no reading is required to follow these directions.
However, because the directions may not be clear for children in the lower end of the recommended age group, ""Robot Invasion"" might be a family activity for a rainy day.Bloco Toys ""Robot Invasion"" robot invaders are suitable for display; they do not stay assembled when used in play situations.
If you or the children in your family enjoy building models or puzzles, you may enjoy Bloco Toys ""Robot Invasion""."
The Bloco Robot Invasion is an innovative, but not a new style of toy from Bloco.
The robots, as are many of their other toys from velociraptors to scorpions, are made from dense non-toxic foam pieces.
The pieces interlink with plastic connectors to make a series of five 3D model robots.
The models, in addition to being fun to build, enable children's imaginations to soar.FEATURES:&#9658;  225 high-density foam and plastic connectors&#9658;  Includes step-by-step instructions for building 6 robots (5 at a time)&#9658;  Kids can either build the illustrated designs or create their own&#9658;  Big thumbs-up from parents for resistant pieces that are safe, easy to manipulate and washable&#9658;  Made in CanadaThe pieces can be washed with warm soap and water when soiled.
I was really surprised to see the robots take shape because I've never seen this type of toy.
My son was always a Legos fan, but although the Bloco Robot Invasion is similar, it creates more exciting 3D critters that can be played with.
Similar to the Legos, children can create their own models instead of making robots, but these robots have a lot of appeal.
There are several different Bloco models with a wide variety of themes (some listed below) that will appeal to imaginative young builders.BLOCO TOYS:Velociraptor andPterosaurDinosaursScorpions and InsectsLizards and ChameleonsVelociraptor and PterosaurMarine CreaturesSavanna in PajamasCombat Dragon ConstructionAqua and Pyro DragonsBirds of Prey
Wow, there are a lot of parts to this.
It took three of us to pull the parts out of the sheet of plastic foam-like parts.
It was really interesting how the parts were pulled out of it.
There were parts inside of parts inside of parts.
It was an impressive design to put all of them together like that.Putting the parts together following the directions was a lot of fun.
It actually was.
The dog left a little to be desired as there were steps that were not illustrated.
There wouldn't be a tail in one but it would be in the next.
The stack of five body parts was also a little bit of a challenge because it didn't work exactly but it was the only one that gave me any trouble.
You can't have two two-part beads and two one-part beads in a row of five beads.
It was ridiculous to figure out what was gong on.In the end, I loved the effect of these toys.
Yes there are ways to make all five of the items to have all 5 at once (but only the robot or the dog as they use the same pieces), but then you start playing around with them and the children make adjustments and now you have new characters.
I loved the way the children made up voices and stories and songs to go along with the play.
Was very disappointed in this toy.
First there is a zillion of these styrofoam pieces that the kids had to put together.
My kids got bored so I put them together and gave them to them and they were not impressed.
Another thing these are more toys that you put on a shelf to look at which is okay.
Once I got them together I thought they looked kind of cool-the kids disagreed.DO NOT get if you have small children in the house!
WOW there are a million pieces to this set!
Once we got everything punched out and sorted we could begin to build.
The instructions were easy to follow and the pictures really helped.
Sorting through the pieces was challenging but part of the fun.
We built one robot based on the instructions and found the pieces to be very easy to work with.
The pieces are very cleanly cut and fit together well.
They are soft but sturdy and will hold up to many robot builds.
We went on to free build and found that to be really fun also.
The possibilities are really endless with this set and I can see even teenagers enjoying building and creating different designs.
Once the robots and creatures are built you can display them or disassemble them to play another day.
They store well in the box, but we opted to separate the pieces into baggies for cleaner storage.
A very nice set!
"This toy has zero play value until you punch out all the pieces from the flat pieces of foam which are in the box.
So, when the 7 year old grandson opened the box Sunday night, he and his 2 1/2 year old cousin started taking pieces apart, while his mom supervised.
The 2yo loved that part.
I gave her a plastic bowl to put little parts in and encouraged her to put bigger parts in the box.
She's two; sorting is what two's do!
She also refused to part with the throw-away bits.The 7yo, on the other hand, lost interest pretty quickly.
To be fair, however, there were aunts and uncles and lots of activity going on.
He did eventually come back to it and started putting some of the figures together and he was able to follow the simple directions pretty well in spite of the distractions.
It really is kid-friendly.The 2yo continued to sort and pour and sort some more.First impressions:**I like the potential.
I think it might have both play value and ""challenge"" value as a child really can build these things him or herself and can also make up his or her own designs!
** They aren't gender specific!
Thank you, thank you, Bloco!
Truly.
** The foam pieces are soft but not flimsy.
And there is nothing to pinch, poke or puncture.
Some of them are tiny though, so keep an eye on little bitties while the older kids play with this - choke hazard.I let the 7yo take it home and I'm going to check with Mom and Dad next Sunday to see what the verdict is.
My 6-year-old daughter spotted these on Amazon and asked me for the kit.
When it arrived, she freaked out with excitement and played with it unsupervised for about the next 45 minutes.
I was busy putting a bookshelf together, so she got busy putting robots together.Well, vaguely.
She didn't even look at the instructions, so she didn't build the robots pictured.
She just improvised, putting together pieces as she figured out which ones would go together.
At the end, I spotted the instructions and suggested we make one together.
It's currently sitting on top of my newly-assembled bookshelf.One star off because you can't really play with them once they're assembled, which made her lose interest.
They're more like building model cars and airplanes and then displaying them afterwards, which is fine, but not quite right for the younger age group.Still, the robots are endearing and fun to make, and the foam pieces are nice and thick, feeling like they'll withstand plenty of taking apart and putting back together sessions.
My 5 year old granddaughter loved and was quite proficient at the build-your-own-robot iPad app Toca Robot Lab, and so I'm not at all surprised that she loves Bloco Robot Invasion.
I expect that her 3 year old brother will come to love it too, though right now it's a bit complex for him and requires too much patience, plus it consists of 225 tiny parts and he is not about to keep that many tiny parts in a contained space.
Part of the fun is that once a robot figure has been built with the tiny foam pieces, one has a figure to admire and put on display, and the finished figures look very cool.
And when one is bored with a given figure or figures, they can be disassembled and the parts used to build different ones.In trying to come up with things to compare this to, grandpa here thinks of Lego, Tinker Toys, and 225 piece jigsaw puzzles.
Like playing with those and especially when working on a jigsaw puzzle with that many pieces, playing with Bloco Robot Invasion is a project and playing with it does require patience, commitment and a decent attention span.
(The only reason I knocked a star off for durability is because it's easy to misplace the small pieces, otherwise the pieces and the assembled robots are as durable as foam pieces and robot figures consisting of such pieces can be expected to be.)
My 7 year old loves building with legos, but I wanted to get him something a little different to try out.
These were a huge hit with him.
He followed the instructions easily, but he's used to following lego instructions so I'm sure that helped.
Smaller children might need help following the instructions.
It was easy for him to pop out the pieces of foam and to figure out how to put them together.
He didn't ask for help at all.
He's been playing with these for a week now and makes something new everyday.
There are small pieces to watch out for if you have very small children, but for any kid who likes building or usually plays with legos, this is a great change of pace!
We've assembled K'NEX and LEGO kits in our house for years.
This was a nice change.
Although you are building 'robots' (which makes it pretty specific in its appeal) you can use your imagination and build any creature you want.
The pieces are colorful, fun to handle and fairly easy to put together.There are a lot of little circles and tubular pieces that get punched out of the larger foam pieces.
It is recommended to hold on to those pieces to fill in cutouts for a more creative design.
I put everything into two bags.
One with the bigger pieces and one for filling in.The foam is really thick and durable except for the light green accessories (like the 'flame' and antennas).
None of our thinner foam pieces have broken yet but could given a little harder tug.
The colors are bright and work well together.My 9 year-old played had fun playing with this and went back to it to make more.
Although the age range is 4-10, a 4 year-old will need some adult help with assembly.
A 10-year old may be bored pretty quickly.It is fun to go back to since once you've made all the robots, you can easily design your own creations.
It is also important to note that this product is made in Canada which almost as good to me as made in the USA.
I'm glad I got this set.
It's hard to find something unique and this is different than the same old plastic building toys.
We even enjoyed popping out all of the pieces, kind of therapeutic, for me at least!
It was fun for my 6 year old grandson to search the pieces for the match to the instructions and they did fit together well, and made some cute robots.
Now he is starting to try and make some without instructions, and this has kept him occupied for several sessions.
I think 5 or 6 would be a minimum age though, as smaller kids might have trouble with many of the smaller pieces.
Looking at the box, I thought this would be a fun set to build awesome robots to play with.
Upon opening the box, my opinion quickly changed.
Whoever created this, was slightly insane, I think.The pieces are made of foam.
They are in sheets and you pop all of the pieces out.
There are a bzillion pieces that need popped out and some are soooo tiny.
When I say tiny, I mean only a few millimeters  - there are some tiny little ones that are just barely 2 millimeters wide and about 4 millimeters long.
Some are tiny flat pieces and some are little cylinder shaped pieces and yes, they are meant to be used in building the robots and adding to the gun.I would never buy this for a 4 year old, although the age range on the box states that as the youngest of the age range.
It is much too overwhelming.
8 & 10 year old nephews totally gave up on it quickly as well.
It takes forever to pop out all of the pieces, for one thing.
Luckily that is a once and done deal.
Assembly takes just as long and is not very fun to do.It seems to take a million pieces just to make one figure and it ends up not being sturdy enough to play with anyway.
My 15 year old daughter actually joined in and finished assembling all 3 figures as per the box and instructions.
She did it mainly because she tends to be a very determined individual and she was enjoying the ridiculousness for some odd reason.To make the eyeballs, you have to insert tiny black rivets into the white balls.
The joints (red) and eyeballs (white) are fairly small.
Smaller than the smaller sized gumballs.I thought this set would be more like Construx type playsets  - a little more sturdy, with easy to handle & assemble pieces.
I got this set for my 4 1/2 year old, not a good idea.
There's too many pieces and it took forever to pop them out of the sheets.
I have a 2 1/2 year old as well, and I found these pieces are much too small to have around with little ones.
Connecting the pieces was difficult because you had to shove the little plastic connectors into the holes.
This set reminded me of a super version of the foam kits you can buy at the craft store.
My son liked a car kit set I bought one year, so I thought he might like this one.
He liked it for a few minutes before moving on.
He wasn't interested in making the robots (instructions included), but would rather sit and design his own thing, which is fine.This set allows for imaginary play, but it's got too many pieces that need to be kept track of, and it's not all together fun to play with.
I wish the pieces were bigger, chunkier, and more simply designed, especially if the company state this is for 4-10 year olds.Good idea in theory, and I'm sure some kids will love it, but 4 1/2 is a bit young for this set.
Shelving it for a later day.
Bloco Toys Robot Invasion got my two kid's attention for hours.
This is a nice alternative to Lego/Duplo, Knex when they get tired playing with the same toys.
This is something different and much easier to work with their hands but still tick their facny and creative imagination.They are made of thick sturdy foam.
Labeled appropriate for children starting from 4 years old and up.
Obviously not for children who love to chew their toys.
It came with the pieces in foam sheets so they have to punch them out first, which my kids enjoy doing.
Just make sure to tell them to put everything in one box to avoid the mess.
This is a toy that encourages creativity and imagination big-time.
There are directions for how to make a few robots as a jumping off point in case you have robot designers block but the possibilities are endless.
The only complaint I have as a parent is that there are so many teensy tiny pieces that a big mess that's hard to pick up can easily be made.
I'm sure more organized parents than me will figure out some sort of system to keep all the little pieces under control.
Overall, this a fun toy that kept my 7 and 9 year old boys entertained for long stretches at a time.
"Much more sturdy than I expected, most of the foam pieces are thicker than I had thought they would be, the connectors are a bit annoying, I actually thought this might be a ""foot"" safe toy, i.e., pieces that don't hurt when you step on them.As long as this toy is only accessable by children 4 years and older, this is a good toy, they can experiment and learn by building.However, (and this is the big however) I would personally not want to be responsible for having this toy anywhere where children under the age of 2 could be exposed to the small parts.Sadly for my grandson, it means he can play with it at one grandma's home, but not at the other places where his younger half brother (1 year old) could get ahold of the small pieces"
First: Don't open this in front of your child.
Open it alone and snap all the foam out of the thick sheets.
Remember model cars and airplanes?
It's kind of like that.
Takes about 10 minutes to punch everything out.
You will want to use some containers to sort the pieces once they are  out - I use those disposable cold-cut containers (Glad makes them) to sort and store.Keep the left-over foam sheets - you can get creative with them.The pieces can be divided into three categories - connectors: These look like balls.
Can also form joints.
What I'll call &#34;effects&#34;: Green foam used for laser blasts, lightening, etc.
Thick foam pieces: The building blocks.The balls are either two across or single with a snap-in connector (snaps into the two across) - these can form joints that rotate.The instructions are illustrated, so are easy to follow.
You can also get creative and just snap stuff together randomly to make your own creations.
Another plus: NOT made in China.
Although it is made in Canada, not the USA.
Still, it's North America :-)When assembled (if you don't make a three ball joint) these do not move easily - but who cares?
When your kid plays with his GI Joe with Kung Fu Grip, or Barbie, do they mode the legs, pretending to walk?
Nope.Have the kid assemble the included projects, then let him/her go wild.
Make a SCUBA Diver (basically the big robot, modified) and more.
I was pleased to see that this toy is not made in China, but rather in Canada.
The pieces of the set are made of high-density foam and plastic.
Since those are basically chemical products, it makes me feel better that this isn't made in China.My 3 1/2 year old daughter is a bit younger than the recommended age of 4 for this toy.
Nonetheless, she enjoys it.
She can't yet follow the illustrated designs, but she uses her imagination to build.
The pieces can be washed with warm water and soap if they get dirty, which came in handy when she got pudding on them.
We really liked this because it is not a craft that requires you to sit there reading and following directions.
Instead you get to use your imagination making whatever type of alien you want(they call them robots, but we thought they were more like aliens).
The pieces are very small, and you have to punch them out, so it isn't a particularly simple project, but it is fun for a creative 6 to 10 year old and for adults that are doing it with them.
My nephew is the perfect age for this toy (9).
Loved building robots and showing them off to his parents.
The pieces aren't the most sturdy, but for the price, I was pleased.
And he was happy with it, which is what matters!
He plays with it all the time!
We got this for my five year old, and he enjoyed this as much (or more, due to the novelty!)
than his Legos.
He excitedly opened the box to find the sheets of foam-like pieces and punched them all out after recruiting his little sister to help.
He grabbed the directions and instantly started building one of the six different robots.As with Legos, he had to find the right pieces and had to fit them together.
I was happy to see they fit pretty snugly and he didn't have to keep going back to fix things that had gotten loose as he went on.And like Legos, these robots aren't really best for play, and rather they are better for displaying.These are not good for children under 3, and I'd say your sweet spot is around 5 years of age.
Bloco also makes other toys that are in the same vein, like sea creatures, and they are also very cute.I love it that this is one of those rare toys that both my daughter and my son love.
These Robots are pretty fun to assemble.
For the most part it's pretty easy to do but with the age recommendation being for ages 4-10, I think those at the lower end of the scale will probably need a significant bit of help.
My son is aged 10 and can assemble these no problem and I'm sure he could've for the past few years as well.The instructions are very easy to follow and they're actually printed in color making it that much easier.
They're step-by-step and each step shows you which pieces are required for assembling that step.These robots are pretty cute.
It's nice to have 5 of them done at a time and display them all.
They're a pretty decent size and they look pretty cool sitting out.
My son like having them set out in his room.The foam pieces are a decent sturdiness for the most part but I'm not sure how they'll hold up over time.
Especially if you disassemble and reassemble often.
For now they're fine but we've only used them a couple times so far.I think this is a cute set and I would recommend getting it if your child enjoys assembling things, especially if they like robots.
