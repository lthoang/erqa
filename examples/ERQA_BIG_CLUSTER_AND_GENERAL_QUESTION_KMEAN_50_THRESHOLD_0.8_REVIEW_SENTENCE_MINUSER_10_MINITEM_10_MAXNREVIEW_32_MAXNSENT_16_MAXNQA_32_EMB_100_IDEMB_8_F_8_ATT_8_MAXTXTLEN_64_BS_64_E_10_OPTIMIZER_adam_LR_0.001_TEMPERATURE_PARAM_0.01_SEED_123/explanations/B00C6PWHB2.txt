Reviews:
I was taken aback when I read the other reviews.
People liked it and to further the confusion, they were actually counting how many cars they could get on the track!?
Our counting stopped at one, after one and the cars would fall off the track, dropping like flies after attempting the very first loop.The directions were clear and the track was fairly easy to put together.
Assembly time: approximately 15-30 minutes, a whopping 4 D batteries were not included (surprise, surprise).
The first included car was propelled at a high rate of speed along the track and maintained this.
Excitedly we added a second car and were immediately disappointed when it could not complete the very first loop, then both cars fell off dropping like flies.
In an attempt to solve the problem we tried different things.
We changed the batteries to ones right out of the package - brand spanking new, we moved the track onto a hard kitchen floor- thinking the carpet was perhaps a problem, we tried adding a book on the track base for weight (as indicated in the directions), also tried a multitude of other cars.
The results were the same each time, one car worked - but two or more, no way.
Even the first car would fall off after a short time.
Disastrous.
It appears as if the propulsion wheels that accelerate the cars need to be spinning at a faster rate.The only credit I can give for this track, is that the track seems to be better made than some of those out there that are thin and hard, cheaply made.
It also was fun to change the cars track by pulling two levers.
We did not have the necessary iPad for extended play.In conclusion, my kids were disappointed, why shouldn't they be?
The box was misleading it showed 6 cars on the track racing and wreaking havoc with crashes.
This track set will not be a hit at our house.
"I've seen a few tracks like this where it was nearly impossible to get the cars to not fall off the loops.
This one is very fast and the car stays on the track pretty well.
We were able to get a few of our other cars to work in it as well as the one that came with it.
We had no interest in the app so didn't check that out.
The plastic ipad stand seems like a lame addition.
The instructions also suggest weighing down the end ""for best performance,"" which sounds like a known issue they didn't bother fixing."
My 9 year old loves it, so that automatically makes the review better.
It was easy to assemble, but took a little longer than I would like.
Most of the regular cars we used worked fine on the track.
He likes using the NASCAR cars and there was no problem with them.
I was somewhat surprised at the need for the large batteries, but they should last a while.
I didn't use the iPad app; seems like overkill for a kid.
While many is the time as a kid I set up the Hot Wheels tracks to encourage crashes, Hot Wheels has one upped my childhood self with the Triple Track Twister.
There will be crashes.
Lots of them, and fast.
The cars really whip around the track and it's all you can do to keep up with them, switching them from track to track and watching them ram into each other.
My two girls loved it, so this is not just for boys.
I don't have an iPad so I wasn't able to try that feature, but it looks like it would be cool.
Even without it, this is a lot of fun.
Assembly was a bit of a pain, but isn't it always?
Once it's put together, get ready for the collisions!
My 5 year old son really got into cars lately so this was a perfect gift for him.Right out of the box, the ramp is relatively not easy to assemble.
I build stuff all the time and the hot wheels car tracks are typically the worst items to assemble.
Personally, I think the people at Mattel hate parents.
But that's another story.
So, assembly is sort of an adventure.
It's possible to do, so long as your 5 year old doesn't try to take the pieces and make a monster track.
You're going to need 4 D batteries to power this sucker up.After you've got it assembled, just turn it on.
The wheels don't have that much power that you can pinch a finger.
I tried and couldn't hurt myself.
(I had to make sure it was safe for the kid.)
The included car works well.
My son was able to use plenty of his other cars on the track.
He made it a challenge to see how many cars he could get running on the track at the same time.They do recommend that you brace part of the track with a book which did help keep the cars on the track.
It's got a little bit of a wobble.The downside to this is the noise.
When the track is on, it's got a medium grade hum.
It reminded me of something like a vacuum cleaner running in the room.
My kids love this.
I mean come on, it flings Hot Wheels around a twisting track.
Even better, some cars don't make it and go flying off: even better!
Kids love a little chaos and destruction!
It's a bit loud, also a plus for kids, if not so much for parents.
Not that it matters, your kids are going to be a lot louder playing with it.
It took my kids a while to figure out which cars could actually make it around the track and which couldn't.
As I indicated they will purposely put cars that won't make in, just to have a wreck.
Now my kids are starting to modify it with pieces of other Hot Wheel sets they own.
We'll see how that goes...  All I can say is that for the price of a video game, your kids can have some old school fun instead of staring at a screen.
Oh and I haven't tried the iPad app and I don't plan to.
Really, racing cars is plenty fun enough, so spare me the iPad gimmicks.
"I think perhaps the most fun part of this toy is putting it together.
""Some Assembly Required"" is an understatement.
There are probably about two dozen separate parts that snap together with only a series of not terribly clear diagrams (no words) to guide you.
I was rather proud of myself for figuring it out correctly, especially since once you snap some of the parts together, you'll have a devil of a time getting them apart if you realize you did something wrong.
Once assembled, this behemoth of a race track takes up nearly six square feet of space and, as mentioned, it can't readily be disassembled.
So be prepared with a large space to house this toy.The fun of setting up the toy lasted longer than the fun my daughters (ages 6 and 4) had playing with it.
The toy comes with one Hot Wheels car (which will likely not be the same one pictured on the package) and a track with three separate loops.
Once you install 4 D batteries (not included, of course) and turn on the track, you position the car at the starting slot and the track will launch it around the first loop.
There are two different levers that your child can pull to propel the car around the other two loops.
If you have additional Hot Wheels cars (I don't know if Matchbox or other similar cars would work), you can have multiple cars going around the loop simultaneously.
While the toy is in operation, the motor generates a fairly loud noise, which my daughters (and I) found annoying and difficult to talk over.This track is very exciting initially, but once your child has mastered the switchovers to the different tracks, you might find that s/he loses interest pretty quickly.
This is probably more of a toy for boys than for girls, so your sons may be interested longer than your daughters, but we had a six-year-old boy cousin come over soon after getting this toy and even he didn't play with it too long.The instructions say that you will need to replace the batteries when the cars are no longer able to be propelled around the loops.
Despite how little we've used this toy, I fear we may already be getting close to that point after just four weeks, as I noticed the cars don't seem to be making it around quite as well.
That's an awful lot of extra expense to run a $45 toy.If you are so inclined, this toy comes with an Ipad stand and an app that can be used with the toy.
We don't own an Ipad, nor do I see the point of turning a mechanical toy into yet more screen/video game time, but from the early reviews, it appears that this feature has a few bugs.
It just seems like something the manufacturers felt they had to add to keep up with the status quo.Overall, I'm not enthusiastic about this toy.
I found the Triple Twister Track to be fairly easy to assemble.
Each 'fitting' is labeled with a letter, and the letter is actually formed in the plastic, not just stickered on.
Took about 10 minutes for an adult male to put together.After the track is set up, I noticed that the instructions offered that you place a stack of books at the far end of the track to weigh it down and improve performance.
There were several joints that looked like they needed to 'set up' over time as they were slightly bowed or bent.
Not a huge deal.Throw in the batteries, turn it on and the included car actually starts to haul around the track.
The lane switching levers are quite a bit smaller than I expected, but worked well.
The included car did great on the track, but I tried three other 'normal' looking Hot Wheels toys and they didn't fare as well.
A Lamborghini was too wide and didn't even fit on the track.
A couple Richard Petty NASCARS fit, but they would randomly shoot off the track and landed about 6' away.
The only car that consistently worked well was the very narrow, very lightweight included vehicle.It worked great, but with only one car, I never got to see a wreck before my niece went home.
I did like that once the whole thing is assembled, I was able to carry it around the house by the base with one hand and everything stayed in place.
I also didn't try the app, though its features are openly advertised on the package (where's the sharks?
).Overall, its ok, but only if you have a decent variety of cars to add to the mayhem.
"We have not had a lot of luck with Hot Wheels tracks for several years - love the cars, but the tracks had always been overly-complicated and cheaply-constructed, a recipe for ""none of the cool tricks work right.""
However, the Triple Track Twister fixes the problems of the past and delivers a lot of racing fun (along with a similar amount of noise).Setup was not 100% easy, as the illustrations in the instructions were drawn from confusing angles and the labeling on the track pieces wasn't always easy to see.
However, by keeping the box cover handy, we were all able to piece it together in about 30 minutes.The track has a base station that accelerates the cars through one of three loops based on which combination of switches you set on the fly.
Each of the paths works fine - no cars flying off into oblivion to stop the fun.
Boys being boys, they immediately set out to alter the ""right"" way to play with the Triple Track Twister and starting loading more and more cars on simultaneously.
This works for a while until there's the inevitable massive collision - to the complete delight!
The track is very durable as well - despite numerous collisions, we've never had a coupling separate or any other fit issues.
Note that the set uses 4 D batteries, so cost-to-operate can get steep over time.
It also makes a lot of noise and there's no easy way to fold it up for storage, so plan on appropriate placement.The iPad integration wasn't something that I was interested in using - kids get more than enough screen time as it is without shoe-horning it into other activities!
I saw my two boys immediately begin developing and using their imagination with the Triple Track Twister (vs. being fed streaming content) so I didn't even show them that additional piece or let on that there's an app that goes with it.The Triple Track Twister has surpassed our expectations for a modern Hot Wheels track, delivering a lot of fun and laughs for our two boys."
This is your standard powered track.
It is a little larger than most and includes a couple neat gimmicks as you can adjust the loop the cars run as one of three choices.
This is done using two levers that are easy for a 4 or 5 year old to use.
This type of toy is nothing new except for the unique ability to pair it with an iPad for some interactive fun.
And that's where this set completely and utterly falls apart.iPad interactivity requires you owning a full size iPad, version 2 or greater.
The set comes with a stand that lines the camera up with a section of the track where two lanes cross.
This allows the camera to show that section on the screen with some added graphics around it that the child can interact with.
In order to choose which scene you are playing, you are supposed to read an included code card.
When this system works my children were focusing more on it than on the track.
Considering that a base track can lose a child's interest fairly quickly this isn't such a bad thing.So how does the app work?
Like I stated previously, it's completely broken.
To start you are given 3 code cards called glyphs.
These are supposed to match up with the options on the app.
Problem is that two options are locked out being in app purchases (Yay!)
and one of the glyph cards matches one of the locked out options.
So you get 3 cards, but can only use 2 unless you buy one.
We are a Hot Wheels family and we especially loved this Triple Track Twister Set.
It is tons of fun, runs 3 cars at a time, and when they collide it is even more laughs along the way.
Having played with Hot Wheels and tracks as a kid, I was really looking forward to the excitement of multiple cars on a sturdy track.
With one car, it works well.
Pulling levers at the right time to get the car to switch tracks is fun.
Otherwise, this track was a huge let-down.
* Two cars didn't stay on the track.
They kept flying off.
Do not use multiple cars near anything valuable or breakable.
* It's really large.
That's not a con in and of itself, but it will be difficult to store.
* When on, it's LOUD, like a Dustbuster.
* To produce the loud sound, you need 4 D batteries.
* It's wobbly.
If your instructions suggest bracing with a book, I'd suggest making it already braced.
That seems like a design flaw they should have corrected.
* Tablet support is for iPad only.
This might seem like a drawback, but given the actual app, trust me, it's not.
We LOVE Hotwheels.
We probably have accumulated more than a hundred of them over the years and have I believe 7 different tracks and play sets for them.
This is the first one for us that is battery powered (four D's) rather than kid powered.
Personally I like my kids to have to move the cars themselves rather than just watch a toy go, but this one is really a lot of fun.
The cars shoot around the track really fast, and fall off just often enough that you have to keep engaged with the toy, but not so often it's annoying.While I would not call this toy dangerous by any means, we don't play with it right in front of the tv in case a car might fly off and scratch the screen.
We don't let the kids put their face right next to the track so they don't get a Hotwheel in the eye.
And please don't let your kids touch the spinning little wheels that send the cars around and around.
Unfortunately my 3 year old daughter was curious and sneaked out a finger to touch one of the wheels.
It did not pinch her but she got a nasty friction burn, her little finger tip turned red and she cried for ten minutes, and this is a kid who doesn't even cry at bloody skinned knees.I'm giving the track four stars because it's super fun and we are enjoying it!
I just wanted to share my safety concerns just in case they might be helpful in keeping your kids safe too.
Pro: Exciting to a little kidPro: multiple tracks that change with the movement of a leverPro: Tracks hold together wellCon: Loud like a vacuumCon: Excitement wears off quickCon: Hot Wheels power port app is iPad only; no Kindle HD or other android supportOnce this thing was running my kids were excited, it's loud and cars zoom around at a blurring fast pace.
They found it fun to pull a lever and have the car go through a different loop then hold two levers and get a 3rd looping track.
It was fun also trying different Hot Wheels cars that we have (It comes with a single car).
Some older cars didn't work well with there slower moving tires.
We had another that was too long and square shaped to make it around the bend, but finding out was part of the fun.
And then after maybe after 2 30 min sessions and a couple of 2 min sessions of playing with it it was done.
It's been over a week now and I haven't heard it get turned on.As an adult wanting to move it, and not having much desire to reassemble it with every move around the house, I was happy to find that it stays together well.
I was able to pick it up whole and carry it upstairs without so much as a single part disconnecting.Beware that this thing is loud.
It sounds like a vacuum when it's on.
If you live an apartment with some sound sensitive neighbors they won't like this at all.
Or if you yourself are irritated with loud vacuum noises running for long stints of time you may want to consider that before purchasing this item.
Of course maybe you have a relative that has kids that you would like to get a nice loud toy for to show them what it's like, then this may be the item you are looking for.I don't have an iPad so I was not able to review the Hot Wheels Power Port app unfortunately.
I'm not sure how much that brings to the table with this, but it did seem like a fun idea which I wanted to try out.
I have a Kindle Fire HD, but after doing some research I quickly found out that there isn't any support for the Kindle Fire or any other Android tablets.
The iPad is the only supported tablet.
"My little car fan had been begging me to pick up this set.
While he has several other Hot Wheels play sets, this one easily tops them all.
Set up was very easy as all parts are clearly marked.
Being able to put the batteries in from the top rather than trying to awkwardly flip the track over and load them from the bottom as with other similar sets.
We of course wanted to try out the iPad app first.
Be aware that this app only works with iPads that have a camera.
An iPad mini should fit, but you will have to prop something up under the stand to get it at the right angle, which is kind of a pain.
Other than that, we had a lot of fun with the app.
Basically you see the track in real time, and graphics are layered over the track to add a theme.
In one of the ""worlds"" there is a robot attacking, and each time you pass him, he takes damage and eventually breaks down.
This was fun at first, but I have noticed my son has moved on from the app aspect and hasn't gone back to it since.
He's more interested in just playing with the Hot Wheels as they are meant to be played with.
The app idea is an interesting and original concept, but I wasn't really thrilled about the idea of a physical toy turning into a virtual toy.
We have enough video games, thanks!
The idea of watching the Hot Wheels race through the iPad's camera, while being very cool from a technological standpoint, also kind of defeats the purpose of playing with the cars in the first place.
Thankfully, this addition doesn't seem to add to the overall cost of the set as similar sets are right in this same price range, so if you don't have an iPad or don't care to use the app integration, you're not really out any extra cash.
This track set is OK, my 5 year old thinks it is fun, a lot of crashes.
It was a pain to put together, wasn't as easy as other sets we have had.
The car that comes with it is not at all like the one pictured.
It does work though, the ipad ap is not that great.
I was hoping for a more interactive toy with the ipad, but this is somewhat of a let down.
The track is still fun and he does use it.
It does work, cars stay on the track.
It has been fun for my son.
My boy loves crashing his cars, making them fall off of furniture - his type of fun is destructive.
I thought this would be great for him.
It was easy to put together and fun to play with but perhaps better for the more mature child.
He recently turned 3 but had a hard time with some of the levers.
I am going to put this away for awhile.
I could see him really enjoying it in several months.
I did not test the ipad features as we really don't play with electronics yet.
"My son has the track like this, with loops, but that one launches the car into the air, where it free falls into a big funnel and then gets righted and put back on the track to go again.
He loves that, and it is a lot of fun with the crashes and the launching in the air.
This one turns out to not work so well compared to that.
If we didn't have that one, I'd probably have rated this higher since I wouldn't have had the comparison.The other one works well for multiple cars.
Maybe it's just the motor is stronger in it, but when multiple cars follow each other, they're launched at the same speed.
This one, if one car goes through the launchers too soon after another, there's a NOTICEABLE change in sound and speed - you can hear that the motor hasn't spun back up to full speed from the first car's passage yet, and the second one goes appreciably slower.
This causes issues since then sometimes the second car isn't making it through the loops and falls out.One thing I did like on this was the little ""cover"" over the crossing point, to help keep cars from launching if they collide.
We've had cars go pretty far on the other track when they hit each other at the crossing, but this one at least offers some protection from that.The iPad integration was just sad.
I had some hopes for it, thinking it would offer some really neat functionality, but all it does is show some animation overlaid on the small area it can see with the camera.
It has an ""on track"" and ""off track"" mode option, both which were just a disappointment to both my son and I.Assembly is quick and easy, everything is lettered so you know precisely where each piece goes.
instructions are just pictures, but that's all you need since each part is labeled so you know what connects where.If it performed better with more than one car, I would've given it four stars, only taking one off for the horrible iPad integration, but since more than one car made things spin too slow to actually get through the whole track, I can't give it more than 3 stars."
"This is more fun than I expected, and younger kids should get a few good hours racing the cars around the triple track.After you add 4 D batteries to this, it has a motor that sends Hot Wheels cars shooting around the loop.
By pressing a couple switches, you can send the cars down two detours, resulting in the ""triple track twister.""
It's not modular, so as far as I know, you cna't really build it together with other sets to get a room-sized track, but it turned out to be a hit with my five year old nephew, who probably spent a couple hours during a weekend visit playing with this thing.What's good:- The track is fast, and Hot Wheels cars cars zoom around the loops well, only occasionally crashing.- The track switching gives a feeling of involvement that kept the kids in our house interested longer than I expected.What could have been better:- We tried the iPad camera based app, but the kids got bored of that almost immediately.- The car that came with our set wasn't that well balanced and tended to fly off the track, but other cars we had from other sets ran great."
"This is a ""super fast"" Hot Wheels track according to my son.
He gets to control the action with a lever that has the cars on a crash course or with an adjustment puts them on course for further racing.
The other boys that have come over have been impressed as well since it does go fast and there is quite a bit of interesting, elevated track action.
My son who is eight put this track together very quickly and by himself.
It has survived quite a bit of play at this point and is still intact despite being picked up and moved by holding the tracks.
We think that this would make a great birthday or Christmas present for the young boy in your life and if my son can easily put it together then so can you."
My son really liked this track.
It was kind of a pain to put together since the directions are made up of pictures, and there are some pieces that look similar to others, but are slightly different.
I attached the wrong piece a couple times, and it's a HUGE pain to take this apart once it's snapped together.Other than that though, it's a lot of fun.
My son preferred to use some of the Hot Wheels cars he already owned, and they worked just fine.
We were able to run two cars at a time without any problem.
If you're using non-Hot Wheels cars, or heavier vehicles, then no, the cars won't stay on the track.
As other reviewers mentioned though, it is loud.
Very loud.
This is not a problem for us since my son plays with it in his playroom, but you definitely won't want them bringing this into the living room if you're trying to watch a show or movie, or if you're on the phone.Overall, I'd recommend this.
I will admit though, now that we've had this for over a month, he plays with it less and less, and it does take up quite a bit of space since it's so big and awkwardly shaped.
I see this as something that will be heading to Goodwill before Christmas comes, to make room for the new stuff.
This was easy to put together and the instructions were detailed and easy to follow.
For the first day, my son LOVED this.
He liked that he could control which track the cars can go into.
Battery-wise, it's not so bad.
He's been playing this for almost two weeks and we're still on the first set so it's not too much of a drain.That said, it's only been two weeks and already the the large track is coming loose.
We have to repair it quite often, which doesn't make too much sense because it doesn't get used as often as the other tracks.
The large loop is so big that very few cars can actually go through it without falling off in the middle so my son plays more with the smaller loops.In all, it's great fun.
Just wish it was put together better.
"This was definitely my son's favorite present that we gave to him for his 7th birthday, and I can't blame him.
It's definitely a fun toy... but:-- It's huge.
Luckily all the kids enjoy the toy enough that I don't need to really put it away, but I have no idea how it will store when I do need to put it away.
It will not fit on any shelf or fit into any toy bin unless I take it apart first.-- It's loud.
If you need a quiet race track in your house, this is not for you-- unless you are far away from the track.
Even in my kids' playroom, I can hear the toy going a couple rooms away.
My husband isn't as good as tuning out sounds like this, so this is a definite drawback for him.-- Assembly is required, as are batteries (4 D's).
The assembly isn't hard, but it can be a bit time consuming if you have some antsy kids who are really excited about playing with the toy.
Note: assembly is made even easier because each track piece has a letter that you match up to the other piece that has that same letter.
This took me a couple steps to realize!-- Lastly, and I'm sure this is specific to our toy, but a piece was missing to fasten one of the loops.
We were going to call the number on the box, but the toy actually works fine without it, so we haven't yet.
Like I said, this probably won't happen to every single purchase of the track, but it's something I figured I'd mention.Some of the positives:-- FUN.
It is very easy for this toy to hold my kids' attentions (ages 7, 4 1/2 and almost 2).
It's fun to watch the cars go around, and it is especially fun to do multiple cars on the tracks and watch them crash.-- You can ""control"" the loops to an extent by some knobs and levers.-- More than one car can run on the track at a time.
You will have crashes, but that's part of the fun.-- The track doesn't seem to be too specific about the type of Hot Wheels you use.
We've had one track where you have to pick a certain shape car, but this one will work with lots of our cars.-- It's so easy, my 22 month old can easily work it.
"My son is turning 5 next month and my daughter is 7, they both throughly enjoy this set.
The set up was a snap and didn't take more than a few minutes.The set does require 4 D batteries (not included)  and only comes with one car.
So if your looking at getting this for someone as a gift those are things to keep in mind.The ""controllers"" were easy for both children to figure out,  and they love making the cars crash.
Any toy that can create laughter for any amount of time is a winner in my book.It also comes with a stand for an ipad as well as an app for additional fun.
Since we don't own an ipad I can't comment on how well it works.
My kids don't seem to mind not being able to take advantage of that feature.Overall I can recommend it for any child age 4 to 10, boys and girls can both enjoy this one.
Well done Hot Wheels!"
My 5 1/2 year old is a car fanatic - loves his Hot Wheels.
He has probably 5 different track sets and I'd say this is right up there at the top.
You can use the levers to control when the cars are released and time them so they could crash, which he thinks is awesome of course.
I think the tricky part is the orange tracks and having them stay upright - you can't crush the tracks or else they lose their ability to hold just so, in order for the cars to stay on the tracks.
If you are delicate with the set, it should hope up fine for awhile.
Fun toy!
"There are certainly a lot of racetracks out there, but I think for the price, this one is great for the younger children.
Both of my grandchildren almost completely took over putting it together by themselves (boy 6, girl, 8) and had a lot of fun and many laughs playing with it when they visited.
It is battery powered, and being actually allowed to ""crash up"" toys proved to be a winning feature with the children, along with the fact that they each had their own controller while playing.
You do need to go out and purchase or use more than just the one car that does come with the set, however.
Otherwise, the most fun part of this toy doesn't function (difficult to crash just one car!!).
All in all, for the price, it is a great toy, and really works well at Grandma's house, as they play it infrequently enough so that there is little risk they will become bored with it over time.
I agree, it is a bit loud, but, then, so are children when they are having fun, so I don't see that as a big negative.
Good job, Mattel.
(Have not used the iPad app, so I cannot comment on it.)"
Our four-year-old wanted this track from the first time he saw it.
It's the only thing he's ever asked for, specifically.
His enjoyment of it is the only reason I'd give it four stars; else, it's a solid three stars.The set is poorly made, and is crazy loud.
It's made of cheap, thin plastic, and the joints of the tracks don't assemble smoothly.
They keep popping out and we've yet to find a way to permanently keep them joined.
It assembled easily enough, though little thanks to the instructions.
That it is limited to specific cars is a little annoying.
Other cars will work on it, though they aren't weighted to manage the torque as well as the included car.
We've also had two cars pop off it with the wheels warped.That is takes four D batteries to operate is a drawback, and that the digital component is made only for an iPad.
Truly, the product deserves 3 stars.The set can still be enjoyed, just know going in that it may not work as expected.
This race track is a must for you little boy or big boy.
My grandson loves playing with it but we tend to fight over who is going to play first as there was only one car.
My son-in-law, my hubby and myself have had a grand time with this and it is a great size for us all.
I always was a hot wheels kid right from the get go and being a girl doesn't mean I need to stick with dolls and teapots and teacups.
I love action like the rest of them and what better fun than to play with youngest man in your life with a toy that has mastered the ages and is still on top.
This is well worth the money as are most hot wheel toys and I for one will be expanding on my grandson's sets of hot wheels come the Holidays.
It's durable, easy to put together and just great all out fun.
This all from a company that thinks about who they are making the product for instead of how many they can push out for the all mightly dollar.
Thumbs up here.
