Reviews:
Before I start my review I must say that usually Amazon would send a big box displaying what's inside so you can't hide it.
This one came in an Amazon brown box so if you're thinking of getting this as a gift for your little one then you have no issues with packaging.
Another thing you may need to do is stock up on your C batteries because this one takes 3 and they're not included.
:)Set up was not too difficult since all the parts were numbered and the directions were pretty simple to follow.
It took my husband setting it up about an hour setting it up by himself.
Once set up though it's a phenomenal toy.
My 8 month old loves it.
She has fun putting the balls in and watching them roll down.
She's at the age where she pulls herself up and I'm not afraid of it tipping over with her because of the stability of the toy.The music is more techno and fun and watching it light up amazes her.
It does take up a bit of floor space so take that into consideration when buying.
I definitely recommend this toy for those crawling and learning to stand.
Construction is sturdy once it is assembled.
This is a toy that will need its own space approximately 3 feet square with room for a toddler or two to scoot around.It does have attractive 'bells, whistles, music and action'.
A younger toddler would need to be assisted and it is more fun for two than one.Seeing new toy innovations, it is sometimes surprising to witness the hits and misses.Initially, this item is a hit and time will tell if interest is maintained.Have always believed that it is a good idea to cycle toys, putting some away and out of reach, and then reintroducing them for a revived playtime experience.
Bear in mind, if that is what you choose to do, you will need to at least partially disassemble.The most positive thing...seeing a little one thoroughly enjoying the play experience.Fisher Price continues to be an extraordinary leader in toy design.
This toy delights my two- and three-year-old grandkids.
Given my experience with the similar Fisher Price Go Baby Go, it should also be a hit with kids as young as 6 months.I think the three C batteries are reasonable (I have much smaller toys that take six AA) but it's too soon to comment on battery life.
Historically, these toys last a long time (like more than a year) before the batteries have to be changed.
The music is fine - more along the line of a space age pinball machine than the recognizable melodies in earlier toys.Ballapalooza doesn't appear as durable as the older Go Baby Go and may be at greater risk of breaking because of the height (kids falling on it).
But my Go Baby Go is 11 years old and has delighted five grandkids.Putting it together was a PAIN!
(See my before-assembly photo.)
It took me almost two hours and I needed my brother to snap some of the pieces in place.
I used a magnetic ratcheting phillips head screwdriver and a long neck phillips head screwdriver.
Might have been easier if I had worked on a big table instead of the floor and if I had had someone helping me.
The screws are in the ball bag.
When it says twist and snap into place, it means to line up the piece with the hole.
You may have to stand up to push hard enough to get it to snap in place.
Be careful when putting together ramp 8 not to miss the instructions on the ramp wall (for the spinner).
Even then, I couldn't get it to work very well.This thing is huge.
Although I got it for the youngest baby, it won't fit in his house.
It's bigger than the kids' toy kitchen.You may end up needing more balls if you have lots of kids or the balls get lost.
"First the bad: for a ""baby"" toy there are a lot of parts to put together!
I agree with the reviewer that  a cordless screwdriver or drill with a low torque setting will make things go quicker.
Definitely plan to do this when the kids are not around!
It's also big - this thing takes up a lot of floor space.
Be prepared for that.Now the good: For a simple toy it's a lot of fun.
We've had it almost two months and the kids still love playing with it.
And I mean all the kids.
I've twin girls (1 year old), and two sons: 5 and 7 years old.
This toy gets a lot of use from all of them, and has encouraged them to play together.
To have a toy as fun for an infant as for a 1st grader is an accomplishment.
It's fun for me to watch them playing and having a good time together.You drop a ball in and it rolls down the slides.
There is an alternate path for a sitting baby giving them another option.
There is also a ""door"" and a ""punching ball"" hanging down.
The real fun here is in the ball drop, but the kids play with the rest too.
It plays some funky music that the babies like to dance too.
It's mildly annoying, but not the worst by far.
This toy is so much fun for the two year old I babysit.
He loves to play with it for hours.
There are tons of paths for the balls to go.
It really promotes eye hand coordination.
It was easy to assemble.
Construction was time consuming.
There were 30+ steps to follow and many parts, but aside from the time it took I'd say that it was pretty easy when following the directions.
Without directions, I'd say it would be very frustrating.A word of caution, this thing is HUGE.
DO NOT ASSEMBLE in a room with a small door.
We almost were not able to move this out of the room that we assembled it in.
We had to really maneuver it and squeeze it to fit it through what I thought was an average sized door (door to our home office).This thing is for children up to 3.
I think that is a fair assessment.
I felt like they could have added a few more features and this thing would have been cool for kids much older than three - but probably that was cost prohibitive.Many of the activities on this play set felt a little like afterthoughts thrown in - like the inflatable ball that just hangs from a pipe, and the green gate thing, and there is a plastic spinner part on one of the pipes.
I was also let down by the cannon thing on top.
It doesn't really shoot balls.
You put the ball in and it kind of falls out onto the trampoline.
In fairness - this toy isn't meant to impress an adult or an older kid it is meant to be fun for a little kid so that will probably suffice.The scale of this toy is so impressive though, especially to a toddler.
They are drawn to it like a magnet.
It is hours of fun.
And since there is a volume control for the music that plays parents shouldn't be too annoyed.
The Fisher-Price Cruise and Groove Ballapalooza, much like its name, takes up way too much space for what it is.
This toy takes up more room than any other we own and there's no way to reduce its size for storage.
Without changing much feature-wise, this toy could have easily been designed to take up half the space.This toy does have some neat design elements.
There is a ball-dropper at the top that you can push balls into and have them fall out onto a angled plastic 'trampoline' pad so that they bounce onto the top of the highest ramp.
There is also a switch that registers falling balls to turn on lights and sound (3 C batteries required).
The toy comes with plenty of balls (which are very hard plastic, so watch where your kids throw them) and the toy does look great when it is fully assembled.
Also, assembly is not too bad, taking roughly 20-30 minutes for the average parent, less if there's help or a powered screwdriver.My children are 8 months and 2 1/2 years old.
They both enjoyed playing with the toy right away, but there interest quickly evaporated.
Simply put, this toy doesn't do much.
The ramps can only be constructed one way and while there are 2 ramps, the shorter path is completely lame.
The higher ramp (with the trampoline) is just short enough for easy access to my older kid, but obviously too much for my little one to handle - she mostly plays with the balls and ignores the monstrous Ballapalooza.
The suggested age range of 6 months to 3 years doesn't make much sense to me.
I feel that any kid over 2 years will quickly become bored and many kids under 1 year will not really be able to use this toy.
So, I would suggest 12-24 months.Overall, I was disappointed by this toy and so were my kids.
It looks nice and is fun for a few days, but for its size and price, it should do more to keep kids entertained.
It would have been easy for Fisher Price to include more ramps and do-hickeys that interact with the rolling balls.
This toy is fun ~ very entertaining and educational.Our grandson loves to run the balls down the chute to keep the music going ~and crawl through the arms, and this toy is also styled to share.The flashing lights on the post are red/green/yellow like a traffic lightand blink on/off to the beat of the music.This activity center encourages various other actionthat promote motor skills and coordination.For children 6 mo to 3 yrs ~ plus.There are 31 pieces to screw and/or snap together, 35 screws, and some stickers.The pieces are notched all different ways, and numbered to aid in assembly.I used a phillips bit, in my cordless drill ~ minimized the torque and went slow ~the plastic is tough enough that all the screws snugged down to a stopwith-out striping out any holes.I found it easier to use the butt end of the rubber coated handle of my hammerto hit the snap joints together, instead of my hands.The switch on the base has two levels of volume.Ballapalooza uses three C batteries which aren't included.This seems to be a rugged toy, and reminds me of the sort of toysyou might see in a Pediatric Doctors waiting room.Up-date - May 27, 2013.
Our grandson still plays with this toy every time he's at out house.He's forever inventing different ways of interacting with the Ballapalooza, running his little cars around the ramps, etc.Perhaps he's not grown tired of it because it's not available to him everyday, but he's still loving this toy.
"This is a great toy, and totally worth the hour to assemble (35 screws).
I measure interest level by how long it can draw my 3-year old away from the iPad: he was entranced for over an hour!
My seven month old is fascinated by it as well!
The folks who designed this really did a great job, providing many different paths for the balls to take, and lots of different entry points for kids of different heights.This is a toy that really will grow with a child, making it a great first birthday gift from a grandparent, parent, or other special family member.
With the pricetag, I can't imagine this would really be a ""friend"" gift...
But any friend who spent the dough would be giving a great product for the money!
This would be a great centerpiece for any little kid's playroom (outside of Manhattan or San Fran where it would take up the whole apartment)!It looks very intellectually stimulating, with a trampoline, and some unexpected behaviour that really got my kids looking at everything closely.
There are lots of colors and many different textures.A review of this product is incomplete without talking about the music.
No ""wheels on the bus"" or ""old Mac Donald"" for this toy!
No, this has some electronica in the style of Taio Cruz (my son's favorite).
Check out the tunes at Fisher-Price's website.
With the flashing lights, it really becomes a dance party!
There's a good volume control so that you have the opportunity to have sound Off, Reasonable, and Club.It requires 3 C batteries and a Phillips head screwdriver to assemble."
"Overall, I'm not super impressed with this toy!
I've listed the pros and cons below, and although the list looks pretty equal, the pros are minor functions compared to the cons of a long time to assemble.
I have a 3 year old and a 16 month old and they really don't seem to care for this toy, which was surprising, but it really doesn't do much other than the balls sliding down the ramps.PROsThe post lights up and has fun musicIt comes with LOTS of balls, so if you lose some you're not frantically looking for something to make the toy work againIt's fun colorsIt has a 2 different music volumes so you can turn it down if you find the music annoyingCONsIt takes a LONG time to put together (took me more than 1 hour and I'm good with putting toys together!
)My kids were bored with it after 15 minutesThe toy itself is VERY large and takes up a lot of room (it's about 3 feet in diameter by the time it's all put together)The balls only can take 2 different tracks, so the limited options, left my kids (3 and 16 months) bored quicklyThe ""door"" they can crawl through doesn't move well and doesn't trigger any music or lightsThe music and lights are not always triggered by the balls going throughIt's too tall for my 16 month old to put the balls in the top part and The crawl through door is too small for my 3 year old to go through, so it seems like they weren't sure what age/ages they were really making this toy for"
This was a toy for my 22 month old son, we wanted to give him something interactive to play with that would stimulate him to move and play.
Out of the box this comes in dozens of pieces and should probably be put together ahead of time when your child is napping or busy, it took a little while to assemble and having a toddler run off with pieces sets you back really fast.
After assembled and getting batteries installed this thing is nothing but fun.
My son got the hang of it very quickly, you can add balls anywhere along the track but he does like to make them go from the tip top all the way to the bottom, we had extra balls from another toy and it is much more fun with the extra balls traveling the course.
This is a very large toy, it works best if you have a playroom or space in a bedroom that is large enough to leave it up all the time, taking it down and moving it frequently is not really easy.
Overall I would give this 5 stars and recommend it for anyone that wants to see their child have active play even indoors on a rainy day.
"This toy setup really draws in the kids, especially the ""punching bag"".
Kids love to rough house with this toy, and it seems up to the task.
Interaction with the balls is popular as well but going through the door became old fast.
Inevitably the kids will start throwing the balls around the house and likely at each other so we expect a few balls to start disappearing.
I've ready some of the other reviews that claim their kids grow tired of this setup.
Well, maybe they expect too much of this toy?
It's not a babysitter unfortunately -- it often requires some adult engagement/encouragement with it after the novelty wears off.
Adults have a way of helping kids think of new ways of playing with it.
Consider the toy part of the play room where kids will use it now and then while rotating among all their toys rather than the star attraction.
Excellent that this toy has a low, high, and off volume setting.
Price point should probably be about $40-$50 (so it is a little high at the time of the review), and it would be nice if it included batteries.
I do wish the toy had a few more interactive items to it.
Overall though I still recommend this toy."
I must say the music and lights are very welcoming in the house.
The construction of the Ballapalooza took a little over a half hour with it's clear instructions and me trying to locate the c batteries that did not come initially with the set.
The product stands just under 3 feet tall and wide and is awkward to carry, which is not a toy that you can easily move throughout the house through doors and hallways, unless there are extra wide.
My main concerns are that my young 2 year old nephew wanted to climb the structure, which is not intended, nor recommended.
I couldn't keep this up for too long in fear for his safety concerns.
My almost 4 year old only wanted to play with it for a few days, since it lacked the bells and whistles for the older 3 year old group.
I would recommend this to the child in the stages of just mastering a toddler bed and needing a toy to keep him occupied till mommy or daddy can come and get him in the mornings.
The Ballapalooza takes up a lot of space.
Each of the 3 legs extends out from the center post about 2 feet meaning that it covers an area that is about the same as a circle with an over 4 foot diameter.
Probably closer to 4 1/2 feet.
I have 15 month old twin grandsons.
They have had a pretty good time with this.
The music is fun and they have learned where to put the balls to get them to go down the shoots.
Their 5 year old brother plays with them some with it.
It would have been nice if you could reconfigure it to keep the interest fresh, but everything gets screwed into place.Putting it together was a challenge.
It took several attempts and is best done without the kids around!
There is some shift in ours and the balls get stuck in one of the shoots.
Not a big deal, just an annoyance.I don't think the amount of space it takes up vs the amount of play time works out.
I also think this will be one of the first things to go when they show no more interest.
Every kid is different, so there's no way to be sure that your kid won't like this toy just because my kid didn't like this toy.
In this house, it was a ball-holder and little else.However, before you buy this, know that it assembles with screws.
You can't make different paths for the balls, you can't build and explore new constructions with your child.
You put it together, they play with it as is, end of story.
It's big, too big to fit through some doorways, and can't be broken down quickly to be put away, so only get it if you have space for this to be a permanent feature in your home.
I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
Assembly is a mother-scratcher!
It's not complicated, it just takes a long time.
It took my husband 2 hours (instead of 1 as most posts say) to finish the product.However, our son loves it.
He plays with it all the time, moves around it, and loves the faux-club music that it plays.
It is worth the time it took to assemble, 100 times over.
I'd make my husband put it together all over again if I had to.
"From an adult's perspective: Ouch!
This took three days over several assembly sessions to put together.
Assembly involves screwing a lot of plastic pieces together.
That's a little tough (although the holes are already there).
Much more difficult is the snapping together of pieces.
Sometimes I had to use jumping force/my weight to snap them together.
Despite this, the instructions for assembly are very clear and the parts are numbered to help with figuring it all out.
Hopefully (and likely!
), you're stronger than I am!
Also be aware that it takes up a LOT of room.Looking at the assembled toy from an adult's perspective, I wasn't even quite sure what it was supposed to do!
There's an inflated ball to bat--it has a ball inside that rattles.
There are flashing lights along with music to listen to or dance to.
There's a little yellow piece to spin around.
And this, of course, is all in addition to the main attraction--chutes, and balls to roll down them!
There is even a ""mini-trampoline"" that the balls will bounce from--but only older toddlers can probably reach the place a ball has to be put in to do this.
That's one thing nice about this toy--it appeals to little ones at different levels, and will grow with them.From a baby's point of view: There is a LOT to take in here, and it's not always obvious what to do with each of the different activities (especially the gate section).
This is a great toy for young kids.
There are so many things to do with it.
When balls are dropped, music is played.
Parts swing and there are lots of interactive activities to do with it.
It kept the grandkids entertained for long periods of time which was great for poor grandma to get some rest.Here are the drawbacks:1.It is time consuming together.
The instuctions are simple and easy to follow but it takes time.
It took my son about 1 1/2 hours to assemble it.
I am not a patient person so I could never achieved it.2.
It takes up space.
It is a large toy.
I have the space but my son does not.
That's why it's at grandmas.Here are advantages:1.
It's fun2.
It makes them use their imagination.3.
It's very interactive.4.
It keeps them out of grandma's hair.
Fun toy, but lots of assembly required out of the box.
And it is rather large, so that is something to consider if floor space is at a premium.
Lots of fun to be had by a fairly big age range.
**Edit Oct 3, 2013 --This toy does not have any grippers on the bottom, so it slides very easily on hard surfaces.
My one-year-old grandson loves this toy.
It took my a while to put it together, but it was well worth the effort.
Seems sturdy once put together.
Packaging was good with all parts clearly marked for assembly.
You'll need a Philips screwdriver and 3 C batteries.
The set comes with eight colored, plastic balls and an inflatable ball with jingle bells.
I saw some similar replacement balls at Toys R Us if you want to add more balls, which we did.
There are also stickers included to decorate the toy.
The music is perky and has two volume levels.
The lights and music are activated when a ball rolls down the chutes.
Please keep in mind that this toy takes up quite a bit of floor space, perhaps a 5 foot or 6 foot square with some maneuver room.
Overall, this is an amazing toy that keeps my grandson entertained.
