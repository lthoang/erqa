Top sentence(s):
If you have a three-year-old girl, chances are her favorite program is Princess Sofia.
Fortunately, we have plenty of Polly Pocket dolls who can visit her, but there's not a whole lot of fun in this pink and purple (and plenty of pastels) world after a week or two.
Given the current suggested retail value of $59.99 for the Magical Talking Castle, I personally think that the extra figurines should be included with this set.My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves the Sofia the First show on Disney Junior, but she doesn't seem to be a big fan of this toy.
And that's not touching the issue of the excessive number of small parts included.I'm with you, I wanted a fun princess castle for my kids and I don't wanna leave you without options.
And if Christmas is coming up, imagine the look on her face when she opens up a big box and out pops the Princess Sofia Magical Talking Castle.

Questions:
Any helpful hints on getting the talking base to work?  I put 4 brand new batteries in it upon putting it together last night.
What all comes with this?  I am wondering if all figurines are included or if it is just the Sophia doll and Clover.
Is this compatible with the royal prep academy doll house and dolls?
Hiii! Can you give me aprox box size? Will it fit in a suitcase? Thanks, Carolina
Are the castle rooms big enough that the figures can be put in each room?   And not just used as a "backdrop?"
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
"My daughter loves Disney princesses, and we've been watching ""Sofia the First"" since its prime-time premiere on the Disney Channel.
On the surface, this looks like a great princess castle play set, and I felt certain that my five-year-old would love it.
Unfortunately, as other reviewers have pointed out, the reality is that this castle requires a great deal of painstaking and often frustrating assembly before anyone can enjoy it.
One will want to devote a solid hour or more to construct something like this from the array of tiny pieces that arrives in a surprisingly small box.And of course, almost immediately my daughter noticed the limitations in her playtime because of the lack of figures and accessories that, while prominently advertised on the box, don't actually come with this pricey play set and must be purchased separately.
It seems a bit blatant and unnecessary.
You get Princess Sofia herself and her pet Clover, along with some furniture and a base that talks when a character activates it.
Of course, it's prominently advertised that the base is capable of some 35 different phrases... phrases that might daughter won't be able to hear unless we purchase a variety of additional figures, including Sofia's friends, parents, and enchanted animals.
One might want to think of this as a Princess Sofia starter set since it clearly requires some collecting in order to make this a fully realized play set.
Even so, all that aside, I cannot deny that - once it was all constructed - my daughter had a great time.
She loves Princess Sofia and has no idea that when she innocently asks me to buy her all of the other characters it just makes me like and appreciate this castle play set less and less."
as far as small doll houses/castles go, this product doesn't stand out, either for being so great or being so terrible.
its really your run of the mill doll house-like product.
it is fairly strong construction, which is great for my not so easy playing daughter, but it didnt really hold her attention for long (hours).
it seems like in the effort to design a mass-producible doll house, creative corners were taken that make it a less exciting product.
maybe its the lack of a broader color scheme, more interactive elements, but something is missing.
if the product were $20 or even $30, my review would be far less harsh, but at this price point, many other, far better products enter the competitive mix.
generally nice product, just overpriced.
I'm a dad, but I had no idea who Sofia the First was, so I just bought this on a whim.
Turns out my daughter loves Sofia so it worked out.The toy itself is fun.
It features all the typical fun a dollhouse should.
That being said, the quality is not so great.
This will not be the dollhouse that lasts for a few years through all of the kids rough play.
It's a short-term plaything that will be replaced down the road.
"This ""castle"" is not worth five dollars.
The day it arrived, I put it together, noting that it is very prone to being easily broken.
The next day one of my two grand daughters came over, we had ordered this together, she was so excited.
The dolls do not stand up well, ( I also ordered the set of dolls with mom and dad, boy and sister.
I had to help my grand daughter every time she wanted to press them on the platform that allows the dolls to talk or make music.
She is 6 years old that is old enough to make an item like this easy for her to handle.Next pieces of the house kept falling off, the dolls cannot stand, or sit on the stairs, chairs .
Some of the dolls stand alone the boy dolls stood with difficulty and fell over at the slightest bump.Here is the big kicker, while we were trying to put a piece on the 'castle' that kept falling off the castle fell over and it was so fast my grand daughter went with it falling on the second floor  flooring of the castle with one hand, the floor broke in pieces , not fixable.This toy is a piece of junk, my grand daughter was crying of course, thanks Disney - ""When you wish upon a star"".... money tells me who you are!60 bucks, a complete and total rip off and 38+ dollars for the set of dolls , can you even imagine, Disney you should be ashamed of yourselves and Amazon don't tarnish your reputation by selling toys from this company anymore."
Princess Sophia is a very popular character.
This is a nice play castle that can be used with the many different figurines Disney puts out.
It has a lot of sayings and is very nice.
It does require assembly to put together.
The kids have enjoyed playing with it.
It comes with A Princess Sophia figurine and the rabbit and then you can buy more.
"This thing was a PAIN to assemble.
It's assembling something very complex from IKEA except the instructions are a lot worse.
In fact, they aren't even instructions.
They consist of barely discernible black and white images printed on a few sheets of newsprint.
Assembly was more like a puzzle, trying to match what I was building to the picture on the box.The result is a flimsey though admittedly detailed and colorful castle.
It does have lots of nooks (am I allowed to say that here?)
and crannies where imagination can run rampant.
Speaking of rampant imaginations...The shows any number of Princess Sofia's pals romping around the castle.
Problem is, they're not included.
Enter my daughter asking, ""but where are all the other dolls.""
It is a shame to begin her play experience with disappointment.
Another disappointment is that some of the features don't work as promised.
The Sofia doll does not slide down the banister and the rabbit doesn't ""hide"" in the spinning cushion.Now to the talking.
The castle doesn't talk.
If it did talk it might suggest you buy a different toy but, we're not there yet.
Everything is ""said"" by placing one of the characters over a small spot on a special pedestal.
"My daughter is entering first grade this fall, and she really loved this castle.Our package included two Princess Sofia dolls.
The original one, whose head wobbled a lot, and a replacement Sofia with a note, whose head does not wobble.
I was happy to see that the manufacturer was already acting to correct any issues with the toy out of the box.The castle comes with a long ""entrance"" staircase, with a clip so Sophia can slide up and down the stairs.
There is a picnic area that pulls out from the ground floor.
The talking platform clips in to the ground floor, and requires four AAA batteries (not included).
The set has a window seat that flips down to hide Clover the Rabbit, Clover is included.
There is a Sofia-sized castle for Sofia to play with, a bed, a throne-like chair, a picnic basket, and a table setting for a royal tea.The talking platform only reveals certain phrases for certain characters.
Sofia and Clover, when they stand on the platform, will make it speak.
To have more sounds, you will need to purchase other items in this set, which are advertised on the sides of the product packaging.This castle took 25 minutes to assemble, and required a Phillips-head screwdriver for the battery compartment, as well as four AAA batteries.
The pieces were difficult to snap into place, especially the purple turret roofing.
I pinched my thumb trying to get them in correctly.
The pieces are made of a lightweight plastic, that I do not expect to withstand years of play.
This is not a castle built for durability.
If your child is rough with their toys, look at the Melissa and Doug castle instead.
If your child is a princess, and is gentle with their toys, then this castle will be pleasing.If your daughter loves Disney Junior, and is ready for the next step up from Little People, then this toy is a good intermediary step."
My little girl watches Sofia and the toy helps bring it to life in the imagination of a child.
The castle is detailed and it also has a place where Sofia talks.
The grand stairs case is neat along with a little bridge!
It is a sturdy toy too.
A quick note - this is a review on the updated and improved version of the Sofia the First Magical Talking Castle.
The two improvements - the heads no longer pop off, and the second story of the castle is now made of plastic instead of cardboard.Disney Junior's Sofia the First is one of the most popular new children shows on TV.
Disney has never been one to be shy to capitalize on a shows popularity through aggressive marketing and has brought out a number of Sofia toys for fans.
My daughter was very excited since Sofia the First has become one of her favorite shows (along with Doc McStuffins, Jake and the Neverland Pirates, and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.
While the show is great - the castle - even the updated version - still has some flaws.The Castle looks like a miniature version of Sofia's castle all the way down to the stained glass that James broke in one of the earlier episodes.
Sofia's room has a replica window sill for her and Clover (and Clover can snap into the daybed and rotated for a little hide-and-go-seek - although this almost never works - Clover usually gets stuck).
Each of the characters sit on the platform and play a variety of phrases - again with some exceptions - neither James nor the King actually speak.Notes- Assembly is not to difficult but does take about 30 minutes- Requires 4 AAA batteries that are not included- Comes with a Sofia and Clover (the bunny) figures.
Sofia is completely moveable (to the point that she bows) - Mattel has improved the figures and now (thankfully) their heads no longer fall off.- When the figures are tapped on the platform they will speak a variety of phrases.
This is cool and fun, but it does have a couple of flaws.
First, it doesn't always work and, second -the character does not always use the correct character voice... at time Sofia sounds like Clover (and vice versa).
While it is not a big deal it is a little disappointing that the product was released with this quality flaw (I have noticed other reviewers stating that they have had a similar problem).
(I am taking off 1 Star for this).
This is one areas where the Magical talking castle has NOT been improved.- The castle is sturdy, but not necessarily at the quality level you would expect for the price.
It is thin plastic - and if something falls on it you may be out of luck.- Lots of fun accessories that are included, although a few of them are pretty small (definitely not for children under 3).
Included is a daybed, real bed, toy castle, a cake plater, a picnic lunch, glasses, plates, and a table.- One thing that is confusing is that you can purchase a separate Sofia Bed Playset but is a little too large to fit into the castle.
It will fit, but it must be fit in (awkwardly) a bit sideways.Final Verdict - The Sofia the First Magical Talking Castle has been improved.
"This is a visually attractive toy castle, but it takes some work to get there.
There are a lot of steps (and poor instructions) involved in the assembly, which could prove frustrating to a child receiving the item as a gift.
For parents considering this as a Christmas present, I'd suggest possibly opening it beforehand and assembling it for presentation.As for playability, it's about average when compared to similar products.
The colors are nice and it will have some appeal because it's Sofia, but the options are limited.
There are only two levels, and very few moving parts so any ""wow"" factor dries up quickly.
As for durability, it's a typical plastic castle that will show its wear if used regularly.What makes this worthy of two stars instead of three, though, is the price.
As with many products from Disney, you're paying for the brand name.
This wouldn't be a bad product at $30, but at twice the price you're severely overpaying."
"Before I go any further, I would encourage those looking to purchase this to search Amazon for ""Disney Sofia The First Magical Talking Castle"" to see the reviews there.
It looks like Mattel has decided to rebrand this item by adding ""new"" to the title in an effort to dodge some criticism.
From what I can having gotten this ""new"" version, nothing's changed.
It's the same poorly-designed toy as from the past.
In fact, I'm hard-pressed to determine what's ""new.""
That said, on with the review.From the moment you open the box and a plethora of pieces fall out on the floor, you can tell you're in trouble.
The included instructions (which share a great deal in common with Ikea instructions, right down to the poor illustrations and lack of written interactions) are next to useless.
Once you get the castle assembled, you can see what the instructions were trying to tell you, but that's only with 20/20 hindsight.
When you have the pieces strewn before you, it may be better to just look at the picture on the box and eyeball it.The previous complaints about Sophia's head falling off still apply here.
This would probably make a great horror set, when the damsel in distress literally loses her head, but as a fairy tale castle, it's definitely frustrating for both child and parent to have to put Sophia's head back on every 5 minutes.
Sophia also doesn't like to stand up either, having a narrow, wobbly base that more or less demands that Sophia spend her life in either a seated position or a face-plant.The ""'magic' base"" feature is terrible.
While removing the base and carrying into a well-lit room results in limited functionality, you really should plan on completely skipping that ""feature.""
It's just not designed well insofar as it needs lots of light to work but rests in a castle that shades it most of the time.The castle itself isn't half bad, though you should expect to immediately lose the small plate and goblet set much like you expect to lost anything the size of a hearing aid battery.
At first I thought I'd say they might actually be a choking hazard, but after some thought I realized that even a 6 month-old would have no trouble swallowing these, so no worries there (sarcasm).
But aside from that, it's kind of a fun play set for imagination... if you throw away Sophia and the sound platform... and can get it assembled.All in all, I would really discourage anyone from buying this.
If you're dead set on it, however, you really owe it to yourself to search for the ""not new"" version to see the reviews there.
This is a nicely made castle with little fun details from the show like the stained glass window that James broke.
It came with Sofia, and the other children are available in separately sold sets.
I think my daughter was a little too old for it, but it would be perfect for a three to six year old who is a fan of the show.
It is larger than I expected and more durable than other houses we have of a similar type.
The plastic wasn't as nice of quality as I would have expected, the stair case snaps off as my kids are playing with it.
They like it, but I really wish it would have been made better.
Assembly was tricky and took at least 30 minutes.
It comes with an extra Sophia, because the heads have been known to pop off easily.
It also comes along with lots of tiny pieces, plates, cups, furniture, so heads up for parents with smaller kids.
Overall it's nice and the kids enjoy it and will play with it for 20-30 mins at a time, but may be overpriced.
Junk!
Please don't waste your money on this!
Your kids will be so excited, because it's Sofia the First and the box makes it look so fun and inviting.
However, it is complete junk.
It is made of flimsy plastic, that snaps extremely easily.
Sofia's head pops off.
It only comes with Sophia, a tiny basket that doesn't open, a tiny rabbit and a toy castle and bed.
The stairs broke off almost immediatley.
The musical stand that you place Sophia on, only works about 25% of the time.
I took this toy out of my preschool class because it only served to annoy and frustrate my kids!
What a piece of junk!
This magic castle is very entertaining and can keep kids engaged in all its capacity.The good features:- Bright colors and big size- Lot of little things to play with- Talking capabilityNow, as other reviewers have mentioned:- Build quality is not great..feels like cheap plastic.- Only 2 characters, need to have more at this price range.- Long assembly time.- Not ideal to play if you have little ones roaming around who can swallow the small pieces.If your kids are good with arts and crafts type stuff, they can make a lot of stuff to fill in the castle, which can be very educational and entertaining.Overall, this toy could have been a lot better and include more figures to keep the value for longer time.
Maybe I would have kinder things to say about this playset if it had been easier to put together, but I'm just not that impressed.
I am especially not impressed that one must buy additional toys to get the castle to say everything it has to say.
Imagine the sad life of a princess, alone in a castle with just a rabbit for company, no one to take care of her, no one to tell her stories.
Fortunately, we have plenty of Polly Pocket dolls who can visit her, but there's not a whole lot of fun in this pink and purple (and plenty of pastels) world after a week or two.
Sure the princess can slide down the stairs, and who wouldn't want to do that, but what is this talking castle?
An overpriced piece of plastic that leaves little girls bored after a short time and leaves little boys out.
On the other hand, it IS painfully cute.
"It seems to me that children's toys are headed the same direction as most things in our disposable society.
When I was a child, children's toys were made for play, with heavy plastic and steel.
The toys did often come with fasteners, or were already riveted together, but they were durable.
In the ""good old days,"" the term ""some assembly required"" seemed to be rare.
This toy is close to being at the opposite end of the spectrum.
The castle comes in (lots) of pieces, most of which require assembly, and the plastic is relatively thin in several places.
In addition to the stuff that needs assembled, this toy has lots of little pieces that are certain to be lost within the first few days of play.The first challenge was to get the box open.
I used a box cutter and STILL struggled to get into the box.
I worried about damaging the pieces inside the box as I struggled to get the box open.
Once the box was open, I learned that I had to remove another piece from inside the box that contained the Princess Sofia doll and a rabbit.
That part was surprisingly difficult to remove and required enthusiastic use of my box cutter.As all the pieces came out, I found ANOTHER Princess Sofia doll with an explanation that the doll that comes with the set was determined to be insufficiently durable (big shock there), so they included a new and improved version.
Maybe Princess Sofia has a twin.I wonder where the instructions are.
I see them.
What kind of instructions are these?
The pictures are unclear and in some cases it was difficult to understand the pieces being assembled.
It was definitely hard to figure out where some pieces attached.
"This is the second version of Sofia the First Magical Talking Castle.
The prior version had alot more issues.
They fixed some in this new version.. but their are still some issues....First impressions of the castle seem great.
Colorful, you see Sofia and Clover and accessories.
Then you see you can hear 10+ magical phrases!
Think again...
It is very difficult to line up your character on the ""magic buttons"" to make the magic talking castle work its magic.
My daughter was soo happy to see Sofia and wanted to get the sound going but after numerous times it only lead to frustration.
Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.
Its truly ""magic"" if it does work.The second story is now made of plastic (first version was actually paper!)
So its a little more sturdy.
The bottom piece though is more cardboard, not plastic but its doable.
It slides in and out and acts as a picnic area (grassy type).
There is a bed for Clover to sit on and hide but its more of a bed then a hideout as that function does not work well.
The castle is cute and all but its flimsy plastic, and really not well made.Her accessories are decent except they are tiny... You have a chair, table, picnic supplies.. but for a toddler you probably have to take away the small pieces.
They did fix the characters which is a huge plus.
This castle set is a manageable size, unlike the huge Barbie dream house--which is good, because most homes do not have a room to set aside for a doll castle.
It also has the battery-dependent talking feature, which requires 4 AA batteries not included.
However, here is where my reservations start to rear their ugly heads.
While capable of 35 talking phrases, for this $60 toy, one only gets 12 phrases--more sets need to be purchased.
The castle only includes one princess and pet--others available to buy separately.
The furnishings are skimpy:  careful comparison of the picture on the box and the included pieces are numerically different.
As a gift-giver, I naively expect a $60 present to at least contain enough stuff to play with the toy.
To inventory the box contents, I had to open the box, with difficulty, and sort it out:  on the box it mentioned in words that all the pictured figures were not included, but it did not tell how many accessories or furniture, etc., were.
Also, since the target age is 3+, the receiver will be misled, because that age is pre-reading.
At best, consider this box of plastic as a 'starter castle', and expect to go to war or marry up to get to the stage of lavish, royal make-believe.
Fans of the sophia show will have hours of fun acting out episodes that they have seen or making up their own adventures.
It's a little smaller than I thought it would be.
I was under the impression that all the characters talk but only SOFIA, AMBER AND CLOVER speak.
And sometimes the voices get mixed up.
As a plus it was very easy to put together and seems to hold up well so far!
Very nice play set.
While writing this review I was asked to rate the educational value of the story.
I gave it three stars - are you really buying this to educate anyone?This toy is fun.
Sophia is the newest princess and apparently attempt to capture the three-year-olds imagination.
It worked.
My granddaughter loves this toy plays with it all the time and I couldn't be happier.
I have had this toy for a little more than two weeks now.
My reviewed based on my daughters excitement and my experience with the castleIf you have a child who is a fan of Sofia the First, they will enjoy the talking castle.
The setup was easy enough for our older daughter to put it together for her younger sister.The castle comes with Sofia and her pet.
It would have been nice to see the other characters included with the castle.In my opinion, considering the price point the price to value ratio is not there.
I would place the price/value to be good at the $30 to $40 price.
I am not docking any stars for the price because this is typical for Mattel.The fun factor is there but we did have some issues with getting Sofia to sing atfirst.
We had her set properly but she did not sing.
It did start working and we have not had an issue since.The quality is typical of toys produced now.
The plastic is flimsy, which may be an issue for any longer term use or rough play.There was also quality control issues with the initial release of the product.
Sofia's head pops off.Mattel has corrected the issue and I have both the bad and good Sofia.
The new Sofia's head stays on.
I recommend calling Mattel if you have the head popping of issue to get a replacement.I would recommend this toy to anyone who has a child who loves Sofia.
The toy will get a lot of use.
It is hard to justify the price tag but if you can afford the toy you will have a happy child.
Do a quality check on the dolls head to ensure you have the newer version of Sofia.Disclaimer: As a member of the Amazon Vine program I received this product without cost.
This dollhouse is really cute and looks really nice, but it isn't constructed very well.
It's very flimsy and hard to put together.Also wish it came with more people/animals to play with, as it only comes with 2.
Overall I'm not that impressed.
I just received this castle and had to review it immediately.
I opened the shipping carton and knew already by the size of the tiny box that there was NO way a castle fit in it.
But I was wrong.
The castle did fit....in about 100 pieces.
They are marked on the front of the instructions with a letter for each piece, but then when we get into the instructions they don't use the corresponding letters to identify which piece you need to use for each step.
So the instructions are all pictures w various arrows pointing to what needs to be done.
I'm sorry but words would be more helpful w the letter accompaniments.
For example, Insert piece A into piece B, place piece C on top.
There are about 4 big pieces and the rest are miniscule and hard to differentiate by in the picture instructions.
AND this doesn't come w batteries.
It comes w the Sophia doll and Clover but you will need to buy more dolls to get them to interact w Sophia and the castle.
So far, I'm disappointed.
I don't have time to build it now, so my kids have to wait.
I will update when I finish and they actually play with it.UPDATE: I got my hubby to put this together and he said it was a pain with the worst instructions anything has ever come with.
Once together my daughters, aged 10 and 4, played with it for most of the night.
They returned to it today and even wanted to take it to Grandma's house when they had to go.
If you have a three-year-old girl, chances are her favorite program is Princess Sofia.
And if her favorite prgram is Princess Sofia, she'd probably like to have a special present to go with the show.
And if she'd like a special present, then what's more special than Christmas coming up?
And if Christmas is coming up, imagine the look on her face when she opens up a big box and out pops the Princess Sofia Magical Talking Castle.
And if she gets the Princess Sofia Magical Talking Castle, just thing of the great big hug that will go with it.
"If your children love Princess Sofia, they will probably love this castle despite its many flaws.
My 3 girls have been absolutely thrilled with it.
Their parents... not so much.It was a pain in the derrier to assemble.
The instructions were rather poor.
The fact that they were black and white made it hard to distinguish which pieces to place.
Further complicating was that it shows multiple pieces being placed at once, when it is in fact very important that several be placed before others could be attached.Several of the pieces don't fit very snugly and pop out pretty easily.The stair case pops off CONSTANTLY.
Since it has a ""hook"" to make the characters slide up and down the steps, but it doesn't move smoothly, which causes the entire stair case to pop off.
Frequently and annoying.The sayings are cheesy and not exciting.
They don't add much to the characters, and the kids were mostly unimpressed and don't even use the feature very much.Overall, it's not a horrible toy, but a good toy poorly executed.
I would say it's worth more like $25 or $30 rather than the almost $60 that they are asking for it."
This is Mattel's second attempt at Sophia's castle, after last summer'sissues-ridden first versionwas finally recalled (purchases of that version on Amazon now seem to link to this one) after Mattel kept having to send out replacement parts.
Purportedly the stairs are sturdier, Sophia's head no longer pops off, and the electrical shorts have been fixed.Not in my experience.My daughters hadn't played with it more than five minutes when the staircase snapped, and the talking part of this talking castle still doesn't work (whether because of lighting or electrical issues - it doesn't matter to a 3yo who just wants to play).
And that's not touching the issue of the excessive number of small parts included.I'm with you, I wanted a fun princess castle for my kids and I don't wanna leave you without options.
With better quality for less money, check out our favorites:Little People Disney Princess Songs Palace(which you can get with Amazon's frustration-free packaging option - sweet!
),LEGO DUPLO Cinderella's Castle, andCinderella Magic Clip Castle.
For an extra $10, but much larger and higher-quality castle, tryMelissa & Doug Deluxe Princess Castlewhich, with a few princess stickers, is easily transformed into Sophia's home.
Sure none of them talk, but most of the time neither does Sophia's Talking Castle - even when it's supposed to.
This little castle is easily assembled and fairly sturdy.
It gives good play value for a Sofia fan.
You might want to get a few extra characters to add to it.
It only includes Sofia and Clover.
It makes a great gift for a young girl fan, especially if you add some more of the family for her.
Overall I am disappointed in the castle, while my little girls enjoy it but are not super in love with it.On my side, I found it hard to assemble and not at all worth the price.
Also, I don't think it's nearly as nice as what was pictured on the box.
Now, I'm used to the box image being nicer and expect it, but I felt this was more than a usual difference.My girls are not hard on toys so the castle has been holding up well with them.
However, I think it would be a different story if your kids are rougher on their toys.Overall though, the girls enjoy it and readily play.
So while I don't think it's a great deal, it's not a complete waste.
My advice - if you can get it on a good sale, go for it.
Otherwise, get other items for the holidays.
"This castle is cute after it is put together, but assembly was not easy.
The instructions are poor, and there are a lot of steps to follow.
For parents who are considering giving this as a gift, it would be a good idea to assemble it beforehand.
I cannot imagine trying to assemble this on Christmas morning with a curious and anxious child trying to ""help"" me.
On this same note, 4 AAA batteries are needed, but are not included.My main complaint is that the castle only comes with 2 figurines (Princess Sofia and Clover the rabbit).
When the figurines are pressed on a certain place, they can say 10 different phrases.
But, in order to have the full functionality of the toy with the 35 other phrases, then you'll need to purchase the other figurines.
There is a set of figurines sold separately for a suggested retail value of $24.99, which includes King Roland II, Queen Miranda, Princess Amber, Prince James, and an additional Princess Sofia.
Given the current suggested retail value of $59.99 for the Magical Talking Castle, I personally think that the extra figurines should be included with this set.My 3 1/2 year old daughter loves the Sofia the First show on Disney Junior, but she doesn't seem to be a big fan of this toy.
She was very excited at first and played with it for about a week.
Since then, I haven't seen her playing with it."
I got this for my two daughters as their both fans of the TV show.
Unfortunately, almost immediately I knew things weren't going to go well... the plastic is extremely flimsy and some of the plastic was bent from just sitting in the box.
Within 30 minutes of assembling, the stairs broke off.
Construction-wise, it's terrible.The base rarely works... often I can get it working again by turning it off and on again (requiring removing the base from the castle), but it never works for more then a couple of minutes.Lastly, there's a LOT of very small pieces...
I don't understand why they list this for being for as young as 36 months.The good news is, both my daughters managed to keep from losing any of the little pieces... bad news is, that's because they only played with it for about an hour.
In the last month it hasn't been touched.
For the two of them to be such big fans of Sofia and not to use this castle, I'm shocked.
I feel it's for the best though since I looked through the entire Sofia line that's available and everything has poor ratings for being flimsy and easily broken.
At least I won't have to get them any more sets to go with this.
This castle comes in a box that advertises an adorable play castle that I imagined my daughter enjoying.
The reality check began when I opened the box to find a plethora of little pieces that I was expected to put together myself with some vague instructions.
In the end,  I found that this was one of those kinds of toys that as my daughter plays with it, a piece pops off every twenty minutes or so.
It started with Clover's window seat.
That was easy enough to put back in to place.
Then the stair railing came off.
Next, it was the window screen and pieces of the roof.
This toy was cute at first, when it was all put together, but It was easy to see that it was too fragile to actually play with.
Save your money for something else!
This toy is not his but a frustration.
