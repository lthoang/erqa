Reviews:
"I played this game a couple of times by myself to test it out.
Once I played against myself with just 2 colors and another time with all 4.
Overall this game is OK, but it doesn't seem to take very long.The perhaps innovative feature is that the ""board"" is a cube.
The goal for each color is to destroy all the other color's pieces.
You can either land on them to squash them or if you get near enough to the ""king"" you can flip the cube to one side and crush all the pieces on that side--presumably that includes your own.
The last one standing wins.The thing is, though, that the cube isn't very big.
This means that it doesn't take very long to reach the king at the top, despite that the dice only goes up to 3.
The rules say you can split your dice roll between pieces but when you can only roll 1-3 that's not all that useful.
The small size of the board means I could finish a game in about 20 minutes.
I can't imagine it would take much longer with other people, unless you get someone who really dithers over his/her moves.Clean-up and storage is pretty easy as you can open the cube to dump everything inside it.
Though to open it you need to have fairly thin fingers or something like a screwdriver.
You should also not keep the game around small children as the pieces would probably be a choking hazard.Anyway, it provides some amusement, but probably not enough for the price.That is all."
Perfect game for families with a mix of younger and older kids (ours range in age from 3-14).
Easy instructions, intuitive play and loads of fun!
Very simple to set up and easy to follow instructions.
Only concern is how long the actual cube will last, as it IS just cardboard.
Perfect game for families with young children.
Easy instructions, loads of interaction and great teachable moments will present themselves allowing for fun for the entire family.
We have played this game several times and are really enjoying it.
The strategy is interesting and the games move quickly.
The only reasons the games didn't get 5 stars is because the cube is light and I think that is why it is difficult to remove the pieces from the cube when it is your turn.All in all, this is a super fun game.
Myself, my wife and our two children, aged 11 and 13 had a lot of fun playing this game.
There was a small learning curve involved in setting up this game but once my granddaughter figured it out, she loved it.
There are two aspects to the game.
The chance roll of a die tells you how many spaces you may move.
However, there is a strategic aspect as well.
You can move to squash individual playing pieces or focus on moving into the top center area which allows you to flip the board effectively squashing (hence the name) all playing pieces on the one side into the cube.My granddaughter will be six in a few weeks and this was an early birthday gift.
She loved it.
Easy to learn and easier to master, she wanted to play it a second time as soon as the first game was finished.
She didn't even think the game was too long that she became bored.
Even the adults who played with her said it was fun, with enough twists and surprises that when you think you might be about to win, you may very well lose your last piece.
How many games are fun for children and grown-ups alike?
Not many.
A great gift for a wonderful child.
