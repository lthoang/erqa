Top sentence(s):
To make things easier, I am going to refer to Disney's Sofia Talking Castle as the Castle, and this toy as Ariel's Ship.As with all toys of this type, the first step is opening the box.
The Little Mermaid Ariel's 2-in-1 Royal ship is one of those toys that little girls love to reenact their favorite scenes from the movieThe Little Mermaid.
The bags for the Castle were sealed, which means they either need ripped open, which can be a challenge for people with arthritis or other issues, or a sharp instrument such as scissors or a knife.The next step is assembly.
Price-wise Ariel's 2-in-1 Royal ship may seem quite pricey, but you are not getting one Ariel scenario, but rather two.
It's a ""ship"" that sails a sea of imagination.

Reviews:
Mattel toys are a hit or miss for me.
In this case, it was a massive miss.My daughter was so excited when she saw this ship.
I personally was not when I saw how many pieces came with it.
There are no tools required, it all snaps together.
However, it is poorly made.
She has had it for several weeks and I can't tell you how many times the parts have snapped apart.
The first day the slide would not even stand up.
The slide is two parts and just sits on top of the other part but it has never stayed in place.
The instructions were not the easiest to follow, some parts I had to put together and guess.
Also the picture is very deceptive, it looks big, and it is NOT!
I know there are measurements for the toy and I would note the size first.One thing I did like is that you basically can play with any of your Barbie's with this.
My daughter did not know it was for one in particular so she was using the other Barbie's she had.
I think that is honestly the only positive thing I can think of with this toy.For the price range, there are so many other toys out there.
I waited to write the review several weeks after my daughter had it to see how long she used it.
She used it for a few days and it just sits there now.
If it gets knocked over it will open up and most of the contents come out and it is very frustrating to put them all back in and try to line up the top of the boat to lock it all up.Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.
I received this item as a Vine reviewer.
I'm saying that upfront so that you understand that I did NOT actually pay $50 for this.
But I sure would be angry if I had.Look, it's a cute playset.
For my daughter, who loves Ariel, it was a welcome addition to her toy collection.
It's colorful and it opens up into a bedroom setting and it's a playset for her large-sized dolls, which she has very few of.But looking at this, I'd say it's a $30 toy at best; you're paying the rest because it's branded Disney Princess.
For $50, you don't get a doll, first of all; that right there was shocking to me.
The toy itself is just a lot of plastic, and not the most sturdy plastic at that.
It's big, but not as big as you'd think for a $50 set meant for Barbie-sized dolls (which it doesn't come with, which I think I mentioned).Come Christmas, if you can get this on a good post-Thanksgiving Day sale at a cheap price, and if you have an Ariel loving child, maybe pick it up.
But there's much better ways to spend $50 for Christmas.
"I got this ship for my five year old daughter.
She has a ton of fun playing with this toy, and never wants to put it away!The pros: The directions are very clear and it is all snap together pieces.
Most of the pieces, if not all, can be put away in the bottom of the ship, which comes apart to reveal a whole new adventure of play.
It comes with doll holders so the ship can be moved without having to hold onto dolls.
It is fantastic for imagination play, as well as ""real life"" play.The cons: The pieces unsnap pretty easily, and the clown fish part would not snap into place at all.I gave this toy three stars because of how easily the pieces unsnap.
Instead of being able to have continuous play, it's often brought to Mom or Dad to fix because it fell apart.
Otherwise, it's an excellent toy and glad to have gotten it for my daughter."
This is a great toy for all of your little princesses out there.
The girls love Ariel so a product that makes her boat is great.
I like that it can be used in several ways - as a boat or as her room.
It's a good size.... not too large but significant enough for them to play with.
I would recommend it.
I just can't think much past the price in reviewing this item.
The ship is a nice little toy, something a little one can be entertained by for a time here and there.
But almost $50, and it doesn't even come with an Ariel or other figure?
I just don't see where anyone could have come up with that price tag.
As a reviewer I got this for free, but if I had to pay for it I wouldn't want to spend more than about $15.
It just doesn't have, or do, enough to make it worth that cost.
The toy itself is kind of neither here nor there - nothing wrong with it but nothing all that exceptional about it, either.
Princess Ariel is a popular character, especially with young girls.
The red- headed mermaid can be found on clothing, lunch boxes, and other merchandise and manufacturers know that Ariel can help sell an otherwise ordinary product.
My girls are like others their age- they love Ariel and most anything with her likeness.
For this reason, I was sure they would like this toy and I didn't hesitate to grab it when it was offered to me.My girls, as predicted, do like this toy.
They like that the toy is a ship because they do not have ships or boats among their other toys and they like it because it fits with Ariel's underwater character.
They like, too, that the ship opens up so that there is more to play with and more ways to make up stories.
And the added accessories make a difference too because, from the perspective of most youngsters, more things to play with make any toy that much better than before.So, the kids seem to like it and that does go far in making a toy rate highly.
But from an adult's perspective, this toy strikes out in a few areas.
One is the connection of the parts.
We assembled everything together like the instructions said, but one of the sides keeps coming loose and popping out at the hinge.
Another connection problem is the snap that joins the two sides together when the ship is closed.
The snap here just doesn't hold and that means your young ones have to be careful when they carry the ship around.
If they store the accessories on the inside and fail to handle with care, the snap will come undone and the inside contents will fall out.There is one other issue I have with this toy, and I notice that others have voiced the same complaint: The price.
I accept that anything with a Disney character will command a premium price, but a cost close to $50 is too much for a toy of this size.
It doesn't even come with any dolls and there are no lights, sounds, or other electronic components.So, my final recommendation on this toy, combining the judgments from the young ones and myself, places it in the average range.
My kids would rate it 4 stars, I would rate it 2 stars, so we will average the two scores and award it with 3 stars overall.
My 3.5 year old is very into small figurines, seems to gravitate to anything boat themed, and is crazy crazy about Disney stuff.
This ship playset is a fun venue to play with her small dolls.
It comes with several fun accessories but no dolls.
It is colorful molded plastic with a little sparkle in some of the details and a really cool slide.The scrolled cut outs in the body of the ship let a lot of light and interest when its opened up, and the upper and lower deck concept is fun for additional creative play.
It feels of medium, not the highest quality I've ever seen.
I'd like the ship more if it had a more interesting interior, but really it is just simple molded plastic with no nooks, crannies, or color.
I do not see this toy as one that would be handed down to other kids over time.While she plays with this ship almost every day, it is not one of her go-to toys.
I know its something she loves when she drags it all over the house, and this one stays put and gets a few seconds of play before we are on to the next thing.I normally relate Disney to high quality and interesting products like their hefty and well made dolls and soft and vibrant plush toys, but this one falls just a bit short.
The ship is a great concept and it folds up nice and compactly.
I do think any little girl would like it, but I might recommend looking around to find something comarable with a bit more interesting detail.
Without meaning this to come across as too harsh, I would present just one caveat for this product - you're paying $50 for a plastic boat that doesn't include a doll of the character for whom it is apparently intended.This toy does have some appeal for those young kids who want a ship for Ariel, and who already have Ariel or other dolls from the set.
The colors are nice, but the craftsmanship is not great, and my guess it that this boat would cost about half the price were it not for the Disney name.
I also wasn't impressed with having to do any assembly given the price tag.Just a disappointing toy overall, with nothing that makes it stand out.
Certainly not recommended at this price.
The Little Mermaid Ariel's 2-in-1 Royal ship is one of those toys that little girls love to reenact their favorite scenes from the movieThe Little Mermaid.
The Royal Ship can quickly turn into Ariel's Grotto where she can sleep on her mermaid- princess bed if she wants or play with many treasures that she's collected.
In this grotto she has things like her vanity, a table, a mirror, a water slide, a treasure chest to store her treasures in, crowns, brush, mirror, etc.
There's even Sebastian and Flounder.
Keep in mind thatDisney Princess Ariel and Price Ericare not included in this set and must be purchased separately.The ship itself needs to be assembled by an adult.
Assembly is so-so.
Because the Royal Ship is meant to change  into Ariel's Grotto, there will be a lot of back and forth between the two.
It's a toy that little girls will love and their creative imaginations will run wild.
Price-wise Ariel's 2-in-1 Royal ship may seem quite pricey, but you are not getting one Ariel scenario, but rather two.
The dolls are not included, but most Little Mermaid fans will have already acquired these dolls.
It's a fun toy that will be much loved.
"This is the second Disney playset I've received through Amazon Vine, and it marks the second time I've been staggered by the poor quality of Disney-branded toys.
Much like theDisney Princess Royal Castle, this Ariel playset is constructed from fairly thin plastic.
Unlike the castle, which relied heavily on printed cardstock for its appearance, this playset is all plastic, but even still, the material is not sturdy enough for the moving parts to align well -- the ship is supposed to open and close, but the best it can be said to do is ""open and sort of close.""
The two-part slide that I received can not be convinced to stay connected without resort to drastic measures (duct tape and glue gun come to mind).There are a myriad of small and medium-sized accessories that come with this playset, including a number of larger furniture pieces (bed, buffet table, two-part slide, nightstand with mirror) that can in no way be arranged to fit inside the boat when closed.
Many of the smaller pieces (the chandelier, the stand that holds the not-included dolls upright) are prone to breakage at their connection points.Nevertheless, my 29-month old daughter plays contentedly with the playset, which seems to engage her imagination and provide practice for her fine motor skills.
I can't justify giving it less than 3 stars (despite the build quality) when it brings her that much entertainment.
If I had paid the price Amazon proposes to charge for the toy, instead of receiving a complimentary copy for review, however, I would be _very_ disappointed in what I received for my money."
"I recently reviewed Disney's Sofia Talking Castle, which I thought had issues when put into the hands of a young child, particularly in the area of durability.
I also thought that set was expensive for what you got.
While Ariel's 2-in-1 Royal Ship is marginally better than Disney's Sofia Talking Castle, the difference is not that much, and Ariel's 2-in-1 Royal Ship has another feature in common with Disney's Sofia Talking Castle:  it is relatively expensive for what you get.Because I recently reviewed Disney's Sofia Talking Castle, I am going to refer to that toy for comparison with this toy.
To make things easier, I am going to refer to Disney's Sofia Talking Castle as the Castle, and this toy as Ariel's Ship.As with all toys of this type, the first step is opening the box.
I thought opening the Castle box was a challenge, even with a box cutter.
The Ariel's Ship box was relatively easy to open in comparison.
As I learned after assembling both toys, neither is intended to come apart - ever, and Mattel clearly made the boxes with the thought that they would receive damage during opening and would then be discarded.Once the box is open, the parts slide out easily.
The larger parts are put into the box loosely.
Smaller parts come in bags that are taped shut, which is a positive because sealed bags require scissors and scissors can be a danger during parties or on Christmas day.
Chalk up a plus for Mattel on this feature.
The bags for the Castle were sealed, which means they either need ripped open, which can be a challenge for people with arthritis or other issues, or a sharp instrument such as scissors or a knife.The next step is assembly.
Instructions in this era of ""symbols"" and assuming that people are illiterate can be more of a challenge than reading.
Fundamentally, you are supposed to look at the pictures and divine how to assemble this toy.
Frankly, I prefer written instructions.
However, given that this toy needs assembled by people who are unfamiliar with English or who are unable to read, Mattel attempted to meet the challenge with pictures.
Simply put, Mattel needs to do better on their instructions.
I have to say that my daughter loves Disney.
The princesses, the movie, even the parks!
So when I was able to get her Ariel's ship playset, I couldn't wait to whip it out and play with her.
When we got it, there were some pieces that needed to be put together, but my husband had no problem taking care of that for me.
Also, for the price, I would have thought that at least an Ariel doll would have came with it, but it didn't.
Then, when I looked up the doll, it was a little pricey.
So, we just played with the dolls we already had.
My daughter had lots of fun with the ship.
She played for a few hours and has played with it at least a few days a week since.
We received the Ariel's Royal Ship Playset as an Amazon Vine Reviewer.My daughter is and I are big doll lovers and love to set up her room to make her playtime easier but having everything out and open makes for a lot of stuff in a little space.
What we loved most about the Disney Princess Ariel's Royal Ship was how easy everything closes up when you are done playing.
So easy to take with you, open up to it's full capacity and close up again.This two in one play set took us about 15 minutes to put it together which we felt was pathetic on our part.The colors are perfect for little princess loving girls.The ship comes with a blue slid so that Ariel can slide into the beautiful water below, a pink bed perfect for a princess, a night table,  chandeliers, some of her favorite friends, a double sided mirror on a vanity featuring Ariel and her princess or a mirror.
There is also a treasure chest, perfume bottle, makeup compact, tiaras and necklaces and even her buddy Sebastian is under a silver tray on a serving cart.My daughter and her friends love setting the bedroom up and seeing all the details in her underwater world.
I also love that the ship comes with doll stands so that your dolls can stand at the wheel of the ship just like in the movie as they sail into the sunset.Great gift for the upcoming holidays.
Doesn't come with any figures, I know it says that but I didn't notice it in racing to order this toy.
It's cute, a pain to get together and not the most durable.
My 6 year old likes it but it certainly didn't keep her entertained for long.
"I suppose the price of this playset is normal for the brand and similar sets.
I do feel like it is a bit overpriced though, for being a rather small ship.It is typical hard plastic, fairly lightweight.
Some of the pieces do not like to stay in place and need reattached during play.When playing with it, Ariel seems like a giant in relation to the size of the ship.
As you can see even in the product pictures here, when standing on top of the ship, if that gold toned arch were not there to provide a bit of a backdrop and some height, Ariel would look ridiculously large in comparison.
I know a child would never think like this, however I am mentioning it to give a better idea of the size.The decorations and accessories used while the ship is opened, are really rather cute.
I personally love the little tealish colored ""crystal"" lamp.
Some of the accessories, like the necklace, tiara, perfume etc are really tiny of course, so they are not meant for young children who might put things in their mouth.It is a cute set overall and any little girl who likes Ariel will be sure to have fun playing with it, but the price is a bit much for what it is."
Ok, so the Toy is pure happiness for Ariel fans like my 5 year old daughter.
It folds and packs in everything in the ship it is in.
My daughter is a big Ariel fan and already has various Ariel stuff.Now I do think I needed to dock off two stars because of the price.
It is more like a 29.99 toy.
At the most 39.99 if they throw in a Ariel doll.
I do not understand at times what people are thinking when they price!
This thing reminds me of the junk that ends up in the bottom of a toybox.
I hate to be so harsh, but neither I or my daughter cared for it.
It was a pain to put together.
It wobbles when set up.
It is like a bedroom for Ariel that turns into a ship and holds her up on the ship.
I understand what they were going for, but I just do not like the final product.
My daughter gave up on it when it fell over twice and messed up her little bedroom she had set up.
Sometimes I say that a toy is a good toy, but my daughter just did not like it.
In this case I think it is just not the best toy.
If you're expecting a Barbie-sized playset for Ariel and Eric, you're going to be disappointed.
Despite that Amazon recommends bundling this playset with the Barbie-sizedAriel doll, those dolls are as big as the playset.
In fact if you look at the pictures you'll see a girl playing with one in which Ariel is as tall as the slide she's supposed to go down, and three times larger than her bed.This playset is more aligned for the increasingly-popularsmall plastic Disney figurinesets, for which it is an excellent playground.
If you're using the right-sized princesses, though, this set is $10 more expensive than the comparableThe Little Mermaid Castle Playsetor the much-largerCinderella Magic Castle, and twice the price of the similarly-sizedSleeping Beauty Palace Playset.In this playset, I feel like many of the swing-arm joints are frail and failing to secure them all correctly (an unlikely scenario for my 3yo) will result in snapping them.
Also, it's a boat; it would've been a much cooler toy if it was made for the bath or wading pool.
But it isn't (for that, check outAriel's Bath Time Playsetfor this same price).I will give credit that, though small, it is a very ornate playset with much more detailing that I usually see on these sorts of toys.
That doesn't redeem the poor value it represents against comparable items right here on Amazon.
While there's nothing inherently wrong with this playset itself, which is why I still gave it three stars, there are better alternatives to recommend.
Maybe if the price drops significantly you should consider it, but at a hefty $50 I wouldn't.
No dolls included is a major problem for this toy.
It is expensive enough it should have included them.My granddaughter is a major fan of Ariel so she has her own and loves this toy but I am not foreseeing a long life for it.
The pieces have to be put together rather often and that can be a bit of a pain for the grownups who have to do it.
The play value of the boat is not quite enough to make up for the problems.For free it is ok and she is enjoying it.
But the price is just too high for what you get.
This is a cute toy, for sure and my daughter likes it just fine, but it compares to a more $20-30 level of quality.
I am sure that it is priced this much because it is Disney Princess brand, but there are better options out there.
It does not strike me as very durable.
"Note: my reviews are from a grandfather, acquiring gifts for 3 and 5-yr-old grandkids.
I rate toys for ""gift impact,"" measured by the youngsters' excitement and gratitude, intended to assist other grandparents and those buying gifts for friends and relatives.
If you're a parent looking for another parent's recommendation, you'll find it elsewhere.This does makes an impressive gift!
It comes in a Disney box about 2ft x 1ft and a few inches thick.
It made an impact, and one little girl, at least, couldn't wait to tear it open and get to Ariel's ship.That said, at $50, it will be too expensive for many.However, the Royal Ship playset will provide hours of fun for an Ariel-struck little girl.
Be clear - this is not a tub toy.
It's a ""ship"" that sails a sea of imagination.
Up above, there's the bridge, and below decks, there's an entire ocean-going bedroom to play in.Also, be aware: an Ariel doll does not come with it.
Many little girls already have one, of course: if not, the doll must be bought separately.
Here's a link to what I think is the correct one, although I didn't buy it as my little princess has several ArielsDisney Princess Ariel Doll -- 12''.
It costs $23+- alone, so with the ship, it's a lot to lay out.
Also, apparently there's a male doll you can get to keep the mermaid company - you can buy a set of two x 12"" dollsThe Little Mermaid & Prince Eric Doll Set -- 12'' Hfor a little under $40.I'm surprised that there is not a recommendation of in-scale dolls on the Ariel Ship page, so you could make a choice sight-unseen from the Amazon catalogue.
That's something that could easily be provided.I don't know if the ship is durable, or how long the attraction will last.
BUT as a gift that will make a splash at a birthday or other special event for your little loved one, in my opinion, this is an extravagant beauty.Recommended - with a caveat about the cost."
Even though I received this for free through Vine, I have to agree with the previous reviewer.
This toy looks nice enough, but not only is the price too steep, it doesn't even come with an Ariel doll!
For the price, I would think the manufacturers could have at least bundled an Ariel doll with it.
My daughter happened to have an old Ariel doll and several other Disney princess dolls, so she could actually create a story around the ship and play with her friends, but anyone looking to purchase this set by itself need to keep in mind that there is no doll included.The set itself is nice enough.
Once assembled (doesn't take much time at all), the set is a ship when folded up, and when opened, it reveals an 'under-the-sea' area with several accessories that little girls can use to create stories.
All the accessories are made of plastic but once again, I did not think these accessories were especially unique to merit such a hefty price tag.
Ariel's bed is included here with a starfish-shaped 'pillow', a vanity with two-sided mirror , an ocean-themed nightstand with a lamp, treasure chest, platter, and other decorations.
There are also some beauty items such as a perfume bottle, compact in the shape of a shell, necklaces, tiaras (for the dolls which are not included).
The top of the ship has a steering wheel and stand that can hold two dolls.
As a playset, it is cute, but unfortunately, the lack of interactive features and doll/s is disappointing considering the price.
