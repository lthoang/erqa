Reviews:
This learning table can be used without the legs so it sits on the floor for children who do not stand up or walk yet and for children who are able to stand/walk the four legs easily snap into place.
However, the legs are very light and my 16 month old is easily able to slide it along the carpet.
I would prefer that the legs be heavier and sturdier to prevent children from toppling over.
For this reason I keep the legs off of our table.
The activities on the table are basic, but educational, colorful and fun.
There are two options for volume control (yay!)
and an option to learn about instruments and musical sounds or ABC's and shapes.
My daughter has been having a ball with this table and I recommend it for children 2 and under.
This sturdy little table toy is absolutely wonderful.
My daughter (17 months) adores it.
Each of the different elements are unique and fun, and the songs are cute and sound good, unlike so many children's toys.
There are options for her to make her own music, but also to flip pages, open the hippo, etc, to hear songs we both enjoy.
I love it that it has the alphabet song, sung clearly and well- so many of these toys have such bad sound quality they're worse than useless, but this is a stand-out option.
Another great thing about it is its compact size.
Our house is quite small, and this piece offers a lot of bang for the space!I highly recommend this one, or theRocktivity Music Skool Table, as both are compact, entertaining, educational, and offer a variety of ways for a child to interact with them.
"This is the 3rd Leapfrog Learning Table we've had, and we like them.
This one is a little shorter than the other two, so I'm not sure why that is.
Maybe so your little one can SIT and play with it.
Both of my boys like to stand and play with it, so I do wish it was a tad taller.I like that these tables are sturdy!
To put it together all you have to do is pop the legs in place, and you're done.
The legs don't come out or become loose very easily, so when my boys stand up on it, it holds strong.
Let's face it, little boys love to climb(I have no experience with little girls, so I can't say for them), so as much as I try to prevent climbing on toys, it happens.
I appreciate the sturdy toys like this one!I like that this one has different activities than the other two we have/had.
My youngest especially enjoys the mirror.
They both like to ""play"" the piano and do a little dance.
They have fun with it and learn at the same time.
That always makes me a happy momma.Overall, my boys and I are all fans of the Leapfrog tables, so we give this one 2 thumbs up(6 thumbs up)."
My LO (and I) prefers the Playskool equivalent to this toy.
This toy is less appealing visually and otherwise.
The only thing she is really interested in is the hippo head.
Otherwise, she picks Playskool every time even when they are side by side.
I think it has a lot to do with the particular sounds that come out of this toy, which are irritating to me.
The human voices sound so high-pitched and off-putting and the music does not engage my LO.
I also prefer the colors of the Playskool table (mostly primary) to those of this one.
This toy just looks and feels like they were trying a bit too hard and unfortunately it just comes off as cheesy and boring.Whereas my daughter plays effortlessly with the Playskool table, I can't even influence her to play with the LeapFrog table by pushing the buttons myself and pretending to enjoy the sounds.
The good points are that the table is sturdy, the legs are removable, and there is a lot to do if your child is interested.
If your child does not already have something similar, it may be worth a shot but I'd test it out in-store first.
We love LeapFrog products and one of my favorite toys from my first son is this LeapFrog play table he got for his first Christmas.
He played with that table probably every day and then my second son did and recently it has been Olivia.
Well LeapFrog has just come out with a new table for kids 6-36 months.The Animal Adventure Learning Table is basically a new and improved table than what we had.
It features bright colors with just enough fun to keep kids entertained (and secretly leanring) and it comes in a round table format.
Since Olivia is 14 months we started it out on its four legs but you can snap off the legs and use it on the floor, which is perfect for kids 6 months old.
Actually our old LeapFrog table helped my little guys learn to stand and build up their confidence to walk since we started with them on the floor and then after awhile I snapped on the legs making them stand up with it to play.
The legs on this table are seriously easy to snap off or take off (no tools required.)
I wish I would have had this table before Olivia started walking, although I definitely see her playing with well into 3 years old (my 4 and 5 year old boys are even intrigued by it!
)Like I said earlier the table is round which to me gives it a modern design and the size is really big enough for two kids to play at.
There are activities around the table but my daughters favorite is probably the drum in the center.
She bangs on that thing like there is no tomorrow!
The other activities involve tapping, turning, flipping, spinning, patting and pressing - lots of playing basically!
The table also goes to sleep after a period of one minute of inactivity and can be woken up by pushing any button.About the different stations:Giraffe:  Flip the page for ABC or 1-2-3 activitiesHippo:  Lift mouth for songs, mirror fun and peek-a-book playTiger:  Slide music notes to learn about opposites and hear silly soundsMonkey:  Spin the guitar for motor skill funPiano:  Explore music notes, melodies, numbers and colorsFish:  Bat the spinner to see it rattle and roll.Drum:  Tap for a musical light show and learn about shapes, numbers, colors and more!Overall, this table has been a hit with my little one, she plays with it multiple times a day, everyday.
She will play for a little bit, do something else and then go back to it.
I love hearing all the different sounds and songs, much better than having the same old songs over and over!
Oh and it does come with the required batteries so it is ready to go right out of the box.I was sent this product to review in exchange for my honest opinion.
"No doubt LeapFrog has cornered the market when they combine fun with subtle learning.
We all know that when toddlers begin to explore in a willy nilly fashion something like the Animal Adventure Learning Table is sure to get their attention in more ways than one.
Giggle time always arrives when little ones are engaged in a game of peek a boo, but can be even more fun when the little lavender hippo opens his mouth.
Underneath is a little mirror and surprise!
Hippo has a lot to say.Hippo:*  ""Hello!
""*  He giggles*  He whistles*  ""Open""  (he says this when is mouth is opened)*  ""Close""  (he says this when his mouth is closed)*  ""Hello, how are you today?
""*  ""Open your mouth!
Aaaah, aaaah!
""*  ""Close your mouth!
Mmmm, mmmm!
""*  ""Are you having fun?
""*  ""Hello!""
(giggles)*  ""Bye-bye!
""*  ""See ya!
""*  ""Bye-bye ... see you soon!Other interactive animals include the orange fish and the monkey holding a guitar.
Both encourage emerging fine motor skills.
"Overall, I'm a fan of this table.
I wanted something that would enable my baby to play as he began to pull himself up and this fits the bill.
It's complicated enough that it will be interesting to him for quite awhile, yet easy to put together and to use, even at 8-months.The table is easy to put together (just snap in the legs) and can be used both as a table or without the legs as a floor toy.
Batteries are easy to install and the power drain isn't bad (we've had the same batteries for over a month and this is one of our baby's favorite toys.
It has many interactive elements and a huge combination of sounds, lights and songs to keep things interesting.- There's a purple hippo head with with a mirror inside that opens and closes, cause sounds and songs.- An orange fish with a cleer plastic wheel with balls inside to spin.- A musical note knob (next to a saxaphone playing tiger cub) that slides back and forth to show opposites.- A red guitar (played by a monkey), with a yellow wheel to spin like a gear.- A ""book"" with a flippable page, which switches the table's modes with numbers and letters.- A central circle with flashing lights in different colors and shapes.- Three ""piano"" keys in bright, primary colorsYou can set the table on two sound levels and place it between ""Music"" and ""ABC"" mode, both of which have different versions when you ""flip"" the book page noted above.
The number of music, sound, mode variables is huge, which results in lots of interest for baby.My one complaint is that the table is not super sturdy.
The legs are light-weight plastic and unless either anchored or wedged in a way that prohibits movement, can easily slide about, which is a danger to babies learning to stand or walk."
We have an older Leap Frog table (square one) and got this for my 8 month old son.
The tables are theoretically pretty similar - have removable legs and a variety of features.
The one thing that really makes this one stands out is the center drum that lights up.
It really is like two toys in one.
Any baby loves to whack things that make noise, so this holds my son's interest for quite some time.
The little mirror inside the hippo is very cute, too!
This is a great and sturdy toy for those just learning to stand.
This newer version of the learning table is a good bit smaller than the original.
It would be very portable and you could even take it with you on vacation if you wanted!
The table has less features than the original i think but my son seems to like this one just as much if not more.
The drum in the middle is fun for banging and the various toys on the outside keep him busy for awhile.
He just turned 2 so he is on the older age for this table but seems very interested in it anyway.
It is really low to the ground and comes waist high on my son, a baby just pulling up would be perfect size for this.
The table is very stable and would withstand pulling up I believe.
My son crawls on top of it and it supports him no problem.
A durable, long lasting, fun toy!
"This has been a wonderful toy for my son!
He started using it at 7 months once he could stand, let's be honest more like lean for a few minutes before toppling over, and has played with it several times a day every day since.
I can credit this toy with really helping him build his strength up.
He just turned 9 months and it is so fun to see him pull himself up onto this and cruise around in circles!
As a parent, I don't find the voices or noises annoying or too obnoxious.
Actually, the little hippo sings a song ""Splish Splash, Hippo Takes A Bath"" and my husband and I actually catch ourselves singing it to ourselves.
This is a really stable, without being heavy, quality toy.
It is my first LeapFrog purchase and I have been really impressed with it."
This is a great product, well-made, easy to put together and both my 1yr old granddaughter and 3yr old grandson play with it and enjoy it.
Also, a good feature is that it allows a young child who is just learning to stand up to stand while playing with it or the toy is versatile enough to remove the table legs and be flat on the floor or on a table.
The only negative is that it does require batteries, but I do think some of the toy's neat features wouldn't be possible without them, so I think OK here.
"My one year old is into playing with toys where she can stand and play so this Leap Frog Animal Adventure learning table was bound to be a hit.
The table offers lots of fun activities and sounds to keep little ones engaged.
The bright colors of this are attractive and draw little ones to it.
The toy has two modes of playing each with it's own sounds and songs.
Be aware that the claim that it has 100 songs and learning responses does not mean that it has 100 songs.
There are a few songs, but it appears that with these learning tables they count each of the little individual sounds when coming up with this number.The toy can be used either as a learning table or you can detach the legs for a younger baby who isn't yet walking or pulling up to cruise.
Leap Frog says the target age range for this toy is 6-36 months but I think 6-24 months would probably be a more realistic age range for the toy.
It's a fun toy but think most 2-3 year olds will not stay interested in this toy for very long.When compared to the Playskool Rocktivity table, I'd say that the Leap Frog table has more to offer.
There's more to do on the Leap Frog table and the songs and sounds are better.
Both tables are roughly the same size but I think you could easily have two kids play with the Leap Frog table where the Playskool one seems like it's made to accommodate a single user.As far as the educational content for the toy, I wouldn't expect this toy to turn your child into a baby genius.
Sure it does colors, numbers, shapes, ABC's and so on, but most little ones will just bang away at the different buttons and so forth on this toy.
I know from my own experiences with my older children that they learned these skills from us and not the ""educational"" toys.Overall, I'd recommend this cute little table.
It would make a great first birthday gift or a Christmas gift for a little one between 6-18 months."
The LeapFrog Animal Adventure Learning Table arrived just before Halloween.
It was intended for my grandson, and was inadvertantly left sitting out.
Friends and neighbors came over that evening with their costumed children.
Instantly the learning table was a hit.
There was enough room for activity sharing and adults could actually converse for quite awhile as the children played.My first impression of the learning table was met with much less enthusiasm.
To me, this toy is like many others, a hodgepodge of electronics, lights, color and music.
It's a glorified busy box which LeapFrog passes off as a learning tool.
I doubt any child will master much from this table.
Perhaps some word opposites, but most everything else (abc's, numbers, shapes, colors, etc) needs strong reinforcement elsewhere (good old-fashioned books come to mind).That being said, kids sure do like the Animal Adventure Learning Table, including my grandson.
It is sturdy, colorful and the child-enticing activities are fun.
If your house doesn't already have a toy that resembles this type busy box, I would recommend its purchase.
If you do own something like it, do you really need another?
We do not have any toy of this sort, so the Animal Adventure Learning Table will be our one and only electronic activity center.
"Overall the table is great for those babies just starting to stand and 'walk' while holding onto furniture and others things.Good:- Lots of buttons to push- Super easy ""assembly""- Counts numbers (1-10) and sings the ABC.
And does some basic colors.- Interactions are all different and require the baby to think about how to interact with each element.
Some are for spinning, others pushing, flipping, pulling.
Some noises are mechanical, others are electronic/sounds.- Lights (our baby tries to eat those light int he center of the table)Neutral:- very light weight.
Which is both good and bad.
Good because if it fall on your toddler's feet of tummy, it won't really do any damage.
Bad because it's easy for the baby to pull it to the floor.- Not really sure what baby is learning, but she likes banging on the table, and seems to like the numbers song quite a bit.- Very small (easy to store, fits anywhere, but I expected it to be a little larger) It's just a little smaller than a regular office chair.Cons:- Easy to topple over.
Baby cannot hold onto it and pull themselves up.
(Or they can, if you hold the table so it doesn't tip over)- Legs have no rubber at the bottom or anything to keep them from slidingOverall this is a fun toy that provides a small area where babies can walk while holding onto something.
It has enough different types of buttons that your child is likely to find at least a few they like; but if your house does not have carpet I would not recommend this product.
It slips very easily on the floor, and baby would be unable to stand up by themselves.
However, it is more stable in carpet so with a little help baby can start standing up without your assistance."
"We ordered this toy for a 2-year old boy.
The size of the toy is perfect for him right now, but may not be as he grows taller.
Fortunately the legs are removable and can be used on a table.
They are easy to remove.The toy is sturdy, functional and a lot of fun.
The child can pick music, numbers, ABC's and cute faces to interface with, such as Hippo and Giraffe.
More than one child can play with it at one time, which is a big plus for us, as he is not always in ""sharing mode"" at this age.
When he has friends over, they seem to really have fun with it playing together.
He also has older sisters who even though they are over 5, seem to get a kick out of playing with Jack on ""his"" toy, as ""mine"" is one of his favorite words at this age.
LeapFrog makes good products, and this is well made, well thought out, and as adults, we loved the recyclable, frustration-free packaging.
Thumbs up for this product!"
My two kids under 3 years old have been pounding on this learning table for almost a month now and they still love it and play with it daily.
I pop the legs off of it so my 7 month old crawler can play with it, my 2.5 yr old will sit by him and play along happily.
Than later in the day I will pop the legs back on and my baby will crawl under it while my toddler dances around it using the center drum.
It is a great toy that really keeps their interest.The music is kind of latin-esque with cha cha type style, a nice break from farmer in the dell!It was super simple to assemble, just put the legs on and give it to your kids.If it broke I would definitely replace it, even at full price.
The ability to the dishes and start dinner uninterrupted is worth 45 bucks to me!
;D
This new Animal Adventure Learning Table from LeapFrog will provide hours of learning entertainment for your little one!
Designed for babies and toddlers between the ages of 6 to 36 months, this table 'grows' with your baby - it can start flat without the legs attached for when baby is laying or sitting on the floor, and then when baby is ready to learn to stand and walk you can add legs to the table to raise it up.
For a little one on the brink of standing and walking this is a great motivator!The different activities are lots of fun and help your little one learn at the same time - they teach cause and effect, numbers and counting, musical instruments, opposites, shapes and colors, and they all help develop motor skills.The sounds stop after about 1 minute if the table is left alone.
The legs are easy enough for parents to remove and put back on without tools, but sturdy enough that there is no fear of the table collapsing while baby is playing.
There is plenty of room - baby can share with others for fun with friends.
Table requires 3 AA batteries which are included.We've owned and enjoyed many LeapFrog products and this one does not fail to deliver with the level of quality and educational value that we have come to expect from LeapFrog.
This table is well made and will last through multiple babies - we'll be happy to pass this down to the next generation when the time comes.
"I ordered this toy for my seven-month-old baby, but my three-year-old loves it every bit as much, if not more!
Like all the LeapFrog toys, this activity table is high on educational value, covering ABC's, numbers, colors, shapes, etc.
To be perfectly honest, by the time you have your third child, you are less concerned about the educational value of a toy and more concerned about the ability of a toy to keep your child from screaming his head off.
(Or maybe that's just me.)
Either way, this toy fits the bill, and the truly excellent thing about it is that it is big enough and has enough activities that both my boys can play with it at the same time.
I also really like that it has removable legs, so it is perfect for my baby to play with RIGHT now, and when he starts standing up, it will ""grow"" with him.
I'd definitely recommend this toy to parents with small children."
I love many of Leapfrog's products, but definitely not this one.
First of all, the claim that it has over 100 songs and activities is sorely overstated - my estimate would be that it has about 10 songs and 7 activities.
The only activities it has are turning the guitar strings by the monkey, sliding the music note back and forth to hear opposites/horn sounds, lifting the hippo's face to see the mirror, turning the page on the 1 page book, spinning the fish wheel, pushing one of three piano keys, and tapping the drum in the center.The drum in the center where they can tap a shape to hear its color and shape name was nice but at 7 months my daughter doesn't have the strength required to make that work.
As an adult, I have to smack the drum really hard to get it to work which is obviously a con and even when you tap one shape, it lights up a different one than you tapped.
I was expecting more activities and was disappointed.It has 2 modes which are music and learning and I do like the bright/attractive colors with the jungle theme.
I did like the use of teaching the opposites.
It was very easy to put together since you only have to attach the legs, but there's no way this toy could work for up to 36 months old as it claims.
My daughter at 7 months already has to bend down to do the activities on the table so it's way too short.
Also, it's not made very sturdy and the legs are very wobbly so you have to sit with your child while he or she stands to use it otherwise they could easily fall and take the toy down with him or her.Given all of its drawbacks, which I was surprised about since Leapfrog always has great products, I wouldn't recommend this to a friend...or an enemy.
Let's just say it's not worth the $35 it cost.
I like LeapFrog products.
So do my grandchildren.
Battery makers like them too!
This one needs 3 AA batteries, but does come with demonstration ones installed.
They are still working in my unit.I like the on/off switch as well as 2 volumes.
There are 2 modes for play.
One is music (30+ songs and musical activities) and the other is a learning mode (letters, numbers, colors, and more).
My 14 month old twin grandsons love dancing to the music.
There are enough activities and space for them both to play on it at the same time.
I also like that you can use it with or without the legs.
All of my grandchildren can pull up and stand, but there is another one on the way, so we will be able to remove the legs when she does some tummy time.
I was impressed at how easy the LeapFrog learning table was to set up.
Just snap the legs in and you're good to go.
The table has two modes, one musical, the other learning.
Each of the 7 activities on the table responds differently.
My daughters favorite is the keyboard in music mode and she likes opening and closing the hippos mouth.There seems to be a gap in the ages that are interested in this.
My daughter liked this a lot when she was first standing.
Now that she can walk, she only pays attention to it for a few minutes before she wanders away.
Mostly she just tries to climb on it.
My 3 yr old nephew, who would not admit to it, likes playing with this.
He likes it because he can name the colors and numbers and sing the songs.So this is a fun toy for ages 6-12 months and then educational for ages 2-3.
In between, not so much, they are too busy exploring everything else.
I have a 16 month old who plays with this toy who is not yet independently ambulatory.
I really like the table and think that the variety of songs, activities, lights/sounds/cause and effects is great.
I especially like how easy it is to remove the legs (tool free) for transport, floor, or table top play.
I also have removed only 2 legs and used it as a slanted/angled toy.
The 2 level sound is a nice option.
I do feel that the legs do not provide enough height.
The 16 month old is small for age and has to bend over to play with the table toy.
A goal is to have the child stand up straight-extending hips and knees and this table only encourages a flexed body posture.
There is also a switch next to the volume control which makes each of the activity functions change to a secondary set of songs, games, and cause and effects.
The unit came with batteries which is great for gift giving ease, but I can not attest to the longevity of their life because I have only used the toy for several weeks.
The table toy does go into a sleep mode with a brief period of inactivity.
The table is too easy to slide across the floor, a non walking (but cruising) baby can easily push it around the room on carpet or hard floors.
Good value toy.
My one year old daughter absolutely loves this toy.
We have had it out for several weeks and it is still the toy she spends the most time with.
There are many things to do on the table, but her favorite is the light-up drum in the middle.
She loves beating on it and seeing it light up.
It has two settings, learning and music, as well as a volume control which, as all noise-inundated parents know, is a wonderful feature.
Assembling it took about a minute as the legs just snap on without any tools needed.
This is a perfect toy for older infants and young toddlers because it is just the right height for them to pull up on and cruise around.
With all the things to do and the two different settings, the fun factor is very high.
I highly recommend this table!
"With a variety of sounds and 'activities', this toy seems most appropriate for 6m-18m age, instead of upto 36m as stated by the manufacturer.
The toy is incredibly easy to set up and has intuitive settings for volume control and learning modes.
The fairly short stature of the toy may make this unsuitable for most kids over 1 year old.
My 18 month old now uses this as ""strength training"" equipment trying to lift it and walk around.One may need to compare it  toBaby Einstein Discovering Music Activity Tableto see which size may be more suitable for your child.
Regardless with a variety of interactions with the various animal characters - a particularly verbal hippo - and some catchy tunes, this is likely to be a good value for 6m-18m and an OK value for 18m-24m.
I don't see the toy being able to sustain interest through 36m age group as the manufacturer recommends."
"This is a really sweet toy with lots of opportunities to play.
One of the nice things about it is that it's so compact in size.
The legs can be kept off (and also come off really easily), and without them it takes up a lot less space than some other toys.From the write-up online, it might be difficult to tell what the toy does, so I'll try to explain some of the things that it does.
First, there are two settings that the entire toy can be put on--either music or ABC (verbal learning).
There are several features, though a couple are not connected to anything electronically.
The features are:1) An open plastic ""book"" with two page spreads.
On the music setting, these do the ABCs or 123s songs.
On the ABC setting, they talk about things like favorite numbers or letters.
From this part of the board, it seems that the speaker (when using the toy) is the giraffe pictured by the book.2) Going clockwise, next there's a hippo's head.
Open the mouth--and there's a mirror!
On the ABC setting the hippo does things like opposites--saying ""open"" and ""closed,"" ""hello"" and ""bye-bye.""
The music setting does a song about hippos, and various sounds.3) Next is a tiger with a trumpet.
The musical note is the action item here--it can be slid left or right.
The trumpet on the ABC setting says opposites--""right"" and ""left,"" ""loud"" and ""quiet,"" etc.
On the music setting, there are things like trumpet sounds.4) Next is a non-electronic guitar.
This can be turned by grabbing the knob or sticking a little finger in the hole.
First off, I must say that the design for the LeapFrog Animal Adventure Learning Table is very attention grabbing and attractive for a child.
It lights up and has pretty colors!There are 2 modes: Music & ABCs/123s with 7 stations:(a) Numbers 123 / Colors - Yellow, Red, Blue- This station is pretty limited with 3 colors and 3 numbers to play, and therefore a little disappointing in the educational value.
However, its a good start for a less than 1 year old child.
(b) Motor skills : Fish rattle- This station allows for motor-skill development, but wished it does more that that.
Perhaps some narration about fishes is a good start?
(c) Letters & Counting- It repeats with only 2 different statements/questions under the ABC mode, but the music mode its great!
It allows for counting up to 10 and has alphabet song from A to Z!
:)(d) Opposites & Music- I like the mirror that comes with the Hippo, and the opposites are great examples!!
:D(e) Opposites & Music- Cute with some motor skill involvement.
Love the opposites, but again with the music mode, there were limited music/narration.
(f) Motor skills : Guitar disc- Again, this station is fairly limited similar to station (b) - fish rattle.
More narration?
(g) Music Drum- Love this little drumming machine!!
It just keeps the child excited with the lights!!
:DAs said, its a little portable toy great for the little ones!
:) but if you are looking for an educational toy, this may not suit your specific needs.
