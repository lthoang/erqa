Top sentence(s):
It was a let-down, since part of the motivation of completing the puzzle was to see the fish swim around - but they didn't do it like we anticipated that they would.
The picture is beautiful and while we didn't get to see the animation due to our phone not being an iphone we are awaiting my nieces next visit with her iphone to see the fish move.
You are prompted to find a fish in the puzzle that matches the one swimming across the screen, and if you touch that fish (on the Ipad screen) you'll be rewarded with a ""you found it!""
But the big thing on this is the augmented reality (AR) component,  I think the AR idea is superb but in this case, I think they need to add features to it.
The promised ""augmented reality"" was a big disappointment to adults.

Reviews:
Ravensburger quality puzzles are always a nice laminated paper cardstock like material and this puzzle is no different.
Amazon wants me to rate the durability of this as a toy but it's a puzzle so when well taken care of, it can last quite sometime.
If you spill water, orange juice or get some other liquid on this puzzle, it is going to damage it.The things Amazon doesn't ask that use to evaluate in a puzzle are image quality and difficulty in putting it together.
This puzzle has a wonderful image that is so detailed that it makes it easy to medium difficulty.
The repetition of certain elements added some complexity to this puzzle, but my biggest problem was with the box cover for this puzzle.
Due to the marketing for this puzzle there is a section in near one of the corners that is covered by the hand holding the cell phone showing how the puzzle can be interactive.
It sounds like a great idea but I have an android and not an iphone/ipad so the app to use this feature isn't available (which is sort of annoying as I would have liked to play around with it).
I wish they could have shown the interactive feature without blocking the large puzzle image.
This 1000-piece puzzle was lots of fun over the course of about 3 weeks.
I left it on my kitchen table and put a few pieces together every night.
It's not a terribly difficult puzzle, although it took me about a week to find the last edge piece since I kept all the loose pieces in the box.As I put this together, I noticed that two or three of the pieces were broken, so I taped them as I used them.
Other than those pieces, the puzzle seems pretty durable.I do not own a smartphone and so cannot review the available downloadable app, although it appears to make the fish swim according to the instructions.
I must start by saying I hate that certain fruit logo'd company as they are what they are, a bunch of fruits and stymying innovation and choice in more ways than one.Aside from that huge negative, this is a great puzzle with a wonderful subject and the composition makes for even greater challenge.
While writing this review and thinking of AR (augmented reality) this would have been so much better with the open platform of Android (to some extent) and even hopefully, Windows 8.
But as an extension, should have been worked into the Nintendo 3ds (or other Nintendo handhelds if they do the augmented reality games, not sure).Tempted to knock of 2 stars because of limited platform support, but as a puzzle only, beautiful.
Our family enjoys putting puzzles together, but I think this was a bit too much for us.
Everyone was gung-ho, until the frame was assembled, which was the easy part.
My 7 year old didn't even attempt to help after the frame.
My husband and I would have to take several days worth of breaks, because the pieces were just too dizzying for us.
The large depicted areas were fairly simple but still challenging, yet the smaller fish backgrounds were very tedious (same color fish, same color background multiple times throughout the puzzle).
We had to spread the extra pieces over our air hockey table just to sort them all out.
You will definitely need a large, well-lit area to place the pieces for viewing.
At one point, I was using a flashlight to see the slight variances of some pieces.
Also, I feel like we were so excited to view the finished product and see the animation, that we were in a hurry and somewhat impatient to finish it, which slightly decreased the enjoyment of putting a puzzle together.Overall, the puzzle quality is very good, with beautiful vibrant colors, and the pieces snap together perfectly.
I like the fact that it is interactive and my son seemed to really enjoy the search and find feature; it takes puzzles to a whole new level.
I would recommend this puzzle to all the puzzle enthusiasts out there, but it is space and time consuming.I have to add that I wish the manufacturer wouldn't have covered the large picture on the front with the smart phone.
We had a difficult time determining what was in both of the bottom corners because the advertising covers part of the picture.
I'm beginning to repeat myself.
Ravensburger is by far the best quality puzzle I have seen.
They are very sturdily made and the cuts are complete so there are no torn edges as you struggle to separate the pieces.
This particular puzzle was very difficult and took me quite a while to complete.
The underwater picture was very busy but beautifully colored.
I didn't have much use for the feature of AR.
But I think a child might really enjoy this feature and it doesn't seem to add much to the overall cost of the puzzle.
Overall I highly recommend any Ravensburger puzzle you care to purchase and if you have kids the AR feature is an added learning bonus.
"This puzzle is much fun.
I'm a novice at puzzling, and this one provided a great challenge while remaining completable.
When I first started it, I was tempted to give up because it seemed overwhelming - the picture is very, very busy with lots of small objects, some of which occur in more than one place in the puzzle.
But with perseverance and patience (and some help from my in-laws who were visiting for the holidays), I was able to finish it and ended up enjoying it a lot.
After working on the larger objects in the puzzle, we sorted the pieces by shape and found that it helped - there are 3 or 4 major variations in the puzzle piece shapes, and working by shape was sometimes the best way to go.
In any case, this is standard Ravensburger quality - nice image quality, cleanly cut pieces, and sturdy construction that promises to last.
Compare the quality of this puzzle against that of department store puzzles and the difference is very obvious.While the puzzle itself is great, the claimed ""Augmented Reality"" feature is not.
This involves downloading an app for your Apple device (Ipad 2 in my case) and then viewing the puzzle through the device's camera.
Ravensburger makes grand claims about submersing yourself in an underwater world blah blah blah, but what you get is a few animated fish swimming across your Ipad screen against the background of your puzzle.
You are prompted to find a fish in the puzzle that matches the one swimming across the screen, and if you touch that fish (on the Ipad screen) you'll be rewarded with a ""you found it!""
chime sound effect.
That's it.
Very lame.Buy this one for the fun of a challenging and attractive puzzle.
Consider the ""augmented reality"" a curiosity - and an uninteresting one at that.
***Update*** After reading other reviews, it became evident that reviews of several Ravensburger puzzles are being lumped under this one product link.
I reviewed the 1000 piece Underwater puzzle for what it's worth, can't comment on the ""augmented reality"" content or experience involved with Ravensburger's other puzzles."
"This product review of the Underwater, 1000 pieces Augmented Reality Puzzle is part of my obligation to Amazon for accepting to be a member of the Vine program, a club of selected customers that provide opinions about ""new and pre-released items.""
We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.The family had a blast putting this puzzle together.
The product came in excellent condition and great attention to detail went into its manufacturing.
The high-tech interaction by an application that animates the puzzle is simply such fun for everyone.We were able to do it in an afternoon, the ages of the participants ranged from 14 through 40.
Sincerely recommend this product for anyone."
"This is one of the more difficult puzzles to put together but if you are persistent and love a challenge then I encourage you to buy this one.
The added use of an iPhone to animate the scene was awesome.
We enjoyed the ""magic"" of seeing the puzzle come alive."
Be mindful of the stated compatibility for the AR app.
It clearly states iPhone and iPad, and clearly does not state iPod Touch.
This is not an oversight.
The app does not work with the iPod Touch.
It might be a simple matter of how it was submitted to the iTunes store, but it will not install on an iPod Touch 5th generation.As to the puzzle itself, this one has worse interlocking thanAnimals in Africa, 1000-Pieces Augmented Reality Puzzle.
The pieces don't click together at all.
There is no grip, and when you need to move blocks, you pretty much move them a piece at a time.
An abnormal number of pieces had bits of paper sort of hanging off them, both on the top and the bottom, and clearly a result of poor cutting.
It's not common for Ravensburger to have any such issues--they are normally top quality puzzles.
I think they were so enchanted with the new technology--which is clever and innovative and I wish I could play with it--that they lost sight of what makes them great.I got Animals and Africa and this puzzle on the same day from Amazon Vine, and I'm hoping they both just came out of a bad batch.
I've done many of their puzzles in the past, and they are normally precisely cut and expertly crafted.The image, once assembled, is gorgeous, and one advantage of the weak interlocking is that the puzzle glue can easily get into the cracks between the pieces for a stronger finish.
I useMod Podge CS11302 Original 16-Ounce Glue, Matte Finishbecause it's easier to apply than the glue in the tube with the sponge tip.
This 1,000 piece puzzle is probably more for teenagers and adults, then younger kids.
This puzzle, once put together, can be viewed by an App (iPhone, iTouch, iPad, etc).
When viewed by the App (your device needs a camera to see the puzzle) the App will show the puzzle, and it will superimpose some animation on top of the picture.
In the case of this sea life puzzle, the App will show fish swimming on top of the puzzle picture -- sort of cool for about 10 seconds, but not worth the hype that this puzzle maker makes of this App.Pro's:* Box is very durable, will last forever (if you treat is nicely)* Picture image is very nice, excellent artworkCon's:* Some pieces fit together that don't go together (with 1,000 pieces, it's hard for each piece to be unique, and while I'm sure under the microscope they are different, some pieces fit together that really don't belong together)* Some pieces don't stay connected well, so if you are moving chunks of connected pieces around to find their home, they will sometimes separate* The cover with the only full picture of the puzzle has a hand over the picture with an iPhone telling us about some special feature that they have included with this puzzle, but that hand and iPhone cover that corner, so we didn't know what the picture looked like in that corner.
Not nice!
* The App for the puzzle is over hyped, not really that fun, just unique to see, but not really fun to use it more than once
"I am a long-time buyer of Ravensburger products, but have never tried one of the puzzles.Here are the positives:1.
We took this lovely puzzle on our beach vacation, where, throughout the week, 11 adults took turns flailing away at it.
We did finish it, and it was challenging!2.
It is really gorgeous to look at.
The depth and variety of color is impressive!
It made it more pleasant to put together, and that's important to me, because I am not a big fan of jigsaw puzzles.3.
It truly engaged us from Tuesday through Saturday evenings.
We have vowed to take a 1,000-piece, challenging puzzle every year from now on!The negatives:1.
The legendary Ravensburger quality just wasn't there in the puzzle piece construction.
Many edges still peeled, even before actually trying and re-trying them, although every piece fit perfectly.2.
The promised ""augmented reality"" was a big disappointment to adults.
Using an iPad, we discovered a very childish game of ""seek and touch the fish.""
It was a let-down, since part of the motivation of completing the puzzle was to see the fish swim around - but they didn't do it like we anticipated that they would.
Also, using the camera feature of the iPad to augment reality wasn't a perfect thing - it was awkward and rather imprecise, as well as sort of nauseating, because you can't gaze at the image on the iPad except from above, so you practically have to stand on a chair to see the image properly, since the iPad has to be kept parallel to the plane of the completed puzzle.
(This is an awkward description of the problem because it's hard to describe it, sorry.
)All in all, it's a nice puzzle and just an ""okay"" toy.
"This is my second Ravensburger ""augmented reality"" puzzle.I worked this with a 7-year old and she much preferred the AR features of this puzzle to the Ravensburger ""Animals in Africa"" puzzle.
She also liked the brightly colored graphics.
I preferred the Animals in Africa for the clean earthier colored graphics, and the relative simplicity of the puzzle.
This was much more difficult to assemble.This puzzle delivers Ravensburger's high quality graphics, puzzle stock, and overall excellent quality puzzle.As far as the iphone/ipad component, I think it is a BRILLIANT idea and an excellent way to coax young people into the relaxing (and UNPLUGGED) past time of puzzling.
It provides an incentive for the time and patience required to complete the puzzle.The seven year old who did the ipad portion thought it was wonderful and got very excited about it.
She would have liked more of this component of the puzzle.
I hope they create some with space and mythology themes (think eyewitness book type material) that will appeal to children--think the AR component would be terrific in those types of subjects.
As it stands the other two designs (Norway and Paris) have no appeal to a small child, and I've never been a fan of those types of puzzles either.As far as the educational value, I place a high premium on any activity that allows people of all ages and abilities to come together and do something together where they are actually really together---not all in same space but looking at own readers, tv, phones, laptops, gaming systems, etc.
This puzzle has the added element of being made of real objects living in a real place so there is plenty of opportunity to talk to kids about the sealife, their environment, whether they would all be in the same small space (and all still alive:>) etc"
As a puzzle, this is a really beautiful and quite challenging puzzle.
Like any Ravensburger puzzle, the quality is superb (well cut pieces, beautiful finish, thick pieces that can be used over and over again).
But the big thing on this is the augmented reality (AR) component,  I think the AR idea is superb but in this case, I think they need to add features to it.
First, the AR only works on an iPad or an iPhone.
It does not work on an iPod touch and you can't download it to the iPod so we tried this out on the iPad.
One thing missing with this is that they should have had a qr code (the funky black and white squares you'be been seeing on everything that you can use to take you instantly to a webpage) on the instructions so you could just snap the qr code and be taken to a site to download the app.
That would have made downloading the app much easier and its really easy to generate a qr code so if any one in their product/brand management team is reading reviews- GET A QR CODE!
But the features of the app itself were pretty limited (at least all that I could make the app do).
Find a fish in 10 seconds.
There is a lot of opportunity to add educational features, etc to these puzzles and in the future, I hope they take advantage of the capabilities of marrying the digital age technology to the puzzles.
So while I think the AR component is a neat idea, I think they really need to add some features to this in the future.
So great puzzle, ok app feature.
We started this puzzle by completing the outside like we start all others.
It was my 7 year old's first puzzle over 300 and she stressed at how difficult it was.
I kept telling her that that was what made it great.
Who wants to do something that is too easy.
It took us 3 weeks to complete doing it whenever we got to it.
It was so worth it.
The conversation, the singing, the laughing, working together and finally when my niece came to visit watching them work together doing something my daughter will remember for a lifetime.
The color make the puzzle challenging.
There is so much going on.
We thought we would start at the blue part and took all the blue pieces out hoping to get that.
When we exhausted that, we moved to the lower right corner and worked our way up.
The picture is beautiful and while we didn't get to see the animation due to our phone not being an iphone we are awaiting my nieces next visit with her iphone to see the fish move.
We did get to see it on You Tube but for now we are storing the puzzle under a bed until.
Our next puzzle will be a Ravensburger.
This is our 3 Ravensburger puzzle and we love the colors and themes.
I used to buy the cheapo puzzles for my kids...and they weren't really that impressed with them.
I remember it was mostly ME who would have to finish them or put them away, the kids just seemed frustrated with them when the pieces ~sort of ~ fit...sometimes you weren't even sure if you had it right or not.
Then I got one of these!
wow!
The difference in quality is obvious as soon as you open the box.
No handfuls of cardboard bits flying around, no tears where the pieces weren't cut properly, even the cardboard itself seems thicker and harder.
Just very nice to manipulate.
The augmented part was cool...but not the best part of puzzle time.
I think I enjoy the family being together (and talking and laughing etc.)
more than any accomplishment of doing the puzzle.
:)
My kids helped me pick out a few puzzles online and this was definitely one of the favorites.
So although we don't have the capability to do the augmented reality (thus I won't be reviewing that aspect), as a puzzle it is your typical high quality Ravensburger and the puzzle itself was really fun!If you have never had Ravensburger puzzles before, you will be impressed by the quality of puzzle pieces and how well they stand up to wear (even from my 6 and 7 year olds!
).I am a big fan of fish puzzles because there are so many different areas that you can work on and it's less tedious than a landscape.
So this was a huge hit (in spite of the large 1000 pieces) with my 6-10 year old crowd of kiddos.
I did help them out a bit, but they did make quite a bit of progress before I came over.
So it holds the attention of even children with it's beautiful picture.
Highly recommend!
What can you buy nowadays for under $20 that will give you hours and hours of fun and a real challenge for the mind?
Not much but jigsaw puzzles.
This is a simple fun project that has been going on for years and years and has never hurt anyone, doesn't have violent images or sharp edges and is fun for everyone from child to elderly.I can't say enough about jigsaw puzzles let alone the Ravensburger ones.
They are top quality with easy to snap together pieces and the artwork is just that......artwork!
This one was especially fun with sooooo many different colors and fishes.
It was like building my own aquarium.We almost always have a puzzle going in our home and if we don't have one we play dominoes which is not really as often as the puzzles.
Jigsaws are a good any time of year project that can include anyone who walks into your home and I think it shows that you are family orientated by having an ongoing challenge that is tons of fun.
