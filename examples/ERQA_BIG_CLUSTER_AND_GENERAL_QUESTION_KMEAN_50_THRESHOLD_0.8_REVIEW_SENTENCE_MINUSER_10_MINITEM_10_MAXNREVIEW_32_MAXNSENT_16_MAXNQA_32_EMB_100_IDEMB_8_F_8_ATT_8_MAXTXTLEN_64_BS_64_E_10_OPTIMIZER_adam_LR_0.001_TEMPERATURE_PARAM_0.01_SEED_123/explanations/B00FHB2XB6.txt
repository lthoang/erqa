Questions:
Does this require batteries. It lights up, so I am thinking it must need batteries but the description doesn't specify that batteries are required.
Do you know where I can purchase the Elsa doll separately?  I bought this used but the doll was not included.
Is the Elsa doll a magic clip doll?
how long the elsa doll and how long castle in full?
Does this connect to the glitter glide castle set?
Where is it coming from ?
Hi, I put this in my cart and now it has moved to the save for later and says no longer available?
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
This playset looks really cool in the pictures and on the box, and some parts of it really are - most notably the cool lighting effects.
It's great that my daughter can interact with Elsa and Olaf and recreate scenes from the movie.
The castle folds in, allowing all the accessories to stay together.
The flashing lights look great from the inside and outside, and they light up the walls, the furniture, and even the characters.
Very cool.Unfortunately, there are some real limitations to the design.
While everything folds up nicely, there is no handle to carry the castle.
Tuck it under an arm or carry it one-handed (or two-handed, if you're a 4-year-old), and you risk dropping it, spilling everything across the floor.
Second, the balcony side of the castle is very unstable.
While there are lots of pictures of Olaf or Elsa standing on the balcony, that is nearly impossible when the balcony is raised up high because the platform shrinks down to less than half an inch.
No one fits on that easily.
If you lower that side of the castle to fit a character, it loses the effect of being a balcony because it's lower than the bedroom - something any 4-year-old will gladly point out to you.
And finally, the Elsa character....  She looks really good, especially compared to some figures from other sets that don't look at all like their character.
She is definitely Elsa, and the dress is accurate and well constructed.
The biggest problem - and this is a problem I've noticed with MANY female characters when they're recreated as toys - is that her feet are just too small for her to stand well.
About half the time she falls over because her balance isn't quite right on those tiny feet, and leaning her against a wall is unlikely to make a child completely happy.Overall a fun set with some cool ideas.
Just wish a tad more care had been taken in all of the planning.
My daughter is a huge fan of Frozen.
When this came out of the box, she was incredibly excited!
She spent five minutes just admiring the lights.
It's a really cute idea - it comes with some furniture, Elsa and Olaf.
The figures are very cute, but small.
I thought with the size of the furniture and figures that the scale would be OK, but even with little pieces it doesn't all work well together.
The bed has to be tilted to shut the doors, and our doors keep falling off.
I have puzzled over the elevator trying to find a way to make it work, and I admit, it's a frustrating toy.I would think with the movie as big a hit as it was, that Disney would have made a better castle to accompany it.
While my daughter still likes to play with the lights, she's freed Elsa and Olaf and put them in her Imaginext space shuttle instead, and has ditched the castle in favor of a toy that actually works.
First the good.
My girls are enthralled with Frozen and anything related.
This is no exception.
The characters that come with it are nice.The bad.
This is cheaply made and falls apart very easily.
The quality is very similar to the Brave playset we also have.The kids really like it, but I am constantly having to put the doors back on.
The three youngest loved this toy, particularly when we turned it on in a darkened room.
I had to purchase another doll from the movie so that everyone had a toy to hold but they loved moving the pieces around and opening and closing the castle.To avoid having the pieces get separated, I put all of them in their own storage bag and we take this out with adult supervision.
Not too much to ask when the toy costs $50 but I think a more realistic price should be half that.
I'd honestly say it's maybe only a two star rating, but the kid loves how pretty it is, so I added an extra star.
It's flimsy, awkward and doesn't stay upright.
It's difficult to play with and definitely on the small side.
The only pluses are that it's kinda cute and comes with Elsa and Olaf figures.
Overall, I'd pass unless you find it for under $15.
"I have a 3 yo who is in love with the movie Frozen and when I had the opportunity to order this through Amazon Vine, I was thrilled.
We got it, and I have to say assembly was a bit of a PITA.
Door need to snap on but it's difficult to get proper leverage.
Things come off easily.
It feels very flimsy.However, my son could not care less.
He's so delighted with the ice palace he's been playing with it 2 days straight.
The first thing he did was put Elsa on the balcony and start singing her Let It Go song.From a parent's perspective, I see a ton of flaws.
* Difficult to close - he needs help with it because the stairs have to go up and the ""stand"" where Olaf is has to go under the castle* Only has Elsa and Olaf.
My son really wanted Anna too but the only way it is to get her seems to buy another set (and given the quality of this one, I am very hesitant to do so)* I keep hearing ""Mommy, can you help me?
I broke it"" as things pop off easily, especially the balcony and the top* Takes 3 AAA batteries (not included) for 3 tiny lights.
Really?
They also only stay on for about 45 seconds.
* Elsa can't stand up on her own.
He was playing with her outside the castle and I hear him say, ""Elsa, do you keep falling down?
I fall down too sometimes.
""So 4 stars because my child is loving it.
This product does not come assembled, but is pretty easy to put together.
However, the pieces have to be aligned correctly, or else it will not close.
Besides the castle, the package includes Elsa, Olaf, a bed, a throne and a dresser.The plastic feels very cheap, and the hinges feel like they could snap apart easily.
I doubt this product will last long.
That being said, my daughter enjoys it and plays with it often.
I wish, however, that they had made it out of better material.
This set reminds me a lot of Polly Pockets.
The figures are kind of small and made from thinner material than you'd find with something like Barbie.
This castle play set is cute, but it took quite a while to assemble and the &#34;wow&#34; or &#34;fun&#34; factor on it was pretty short lived.At this point my daughter goes crazy for anything Frozen related, but she quickly lost interest in this set.
Medium build quality, small figurines and a lot of assembly don't make this one something I'd really recommend.
The thing is, I think it would be a worthwhile set if it were about half the price.
There are some cool features, particularly the lights, but the whole thing isn't built well.
It's not sturdy and won't stand up to normal kid play, and the pieces don't want to stay together correctly.
It's small and portable, and the figurines are cute, but there's not much to do here and a lack of quality control.
I'd skip this one and wait for them to release something better... considering the huge success of Frozen, I'd expect that better toys will be on the way in the coming months.
My kids are nuts about Frozen (who isn't right now) so they were really excited to get the Elsa Castle Playset.
It even comes with and Olaf doll - my favorite part.Out of the box the castle comes in numerous pieces and needs to be assembled.
Here's where the problem lies.
I found that many of the pieces did not hold when I snapped them together.
The top of the turret piece won's stay on and the doors of the sides pop off frequently.
This means that, a lot of the time, the castle is in pieces.
The top turret piece is also integral for turning the ice piece in the middle - that basically doesn't work on ours.The play set comes with a couple of small pieces of furniture that do not amount to much.
A lot of the Frozen-related merchandise seems to have been churned out too quickly, and priced up to a premium due to demand.
This is no different.
It's actually a very basic, disappointing little playset.
There is an Olaf and an Elsa, but no other characters--though any of the small Disney princess figures would fit in here, if you have those.
The plastic is very cheap and not particularly durable.
With only two figures, there's only so much the kids can do with it.
Even though they are Frozen fanatics, this has mostly been ignored.
First of all - the setup.
I did have to follow the directions, but got it set up more or less correctly (even with &#34;help&#34; from one of the kiddos).
The one thing that didn't seem to work quite right was the side doors and the elevator to the balcony.
We can finagle it, but it is frustrating so the kids stopped trying.The best part of the toy was the light show.
I would advise putting in the batteries before you put the rest of it together.
There is no sound (a giant plus) and the kids will likely really like the lights.
It remains their favorite part of the toy.My eldest thought that the doll did not look like Elsa.
She had the right clothes and hair, but otherwise didn't look close enough to the animation.Most of the furniture was lost within 15 minutes of allowing the kids to play with the toy.
I pretty much expected this and almost wish those items hadn't been included, as I am sure to step on it sometime soon.They did love that Olaf the snowman was included.I might consider this as a gift for the child who really loves Frozen and has a lot of the smaller size dolls.
Really had such high hopes for this toydd is a HUGE frozen fanand we have many of the dollsso thought this would be a great addition to her collectionfirst it is soooo frustrating because the two sides do not really stay &#34;locked&#34; in place when playing with itthe balcony side oh just forget trying to keep that side in placethen trying to get Elsa up to the top the way it is intendedugh does not really work the little elevator part just keeps falling out and offthen trying to get Elsa to sit on her chairanother pain in the buttit is a cute idea just falls flat to acutally be played withmy daughter loved the fabric of the dressinstead of it being plastic like the mini dollsthat is another thing the other snap fit dolls they can not be used with this setthey are bigger than the doll in this setnow olaf he is super cute and the doll itself is so cutebut honestly i would take the money and get something elsei can see a younger child getting really frustrated and upsetso basically this thing will be used more as a decoration for her room
This was pretty easy to assemble, but it isn't exactly high quality.
The sides keep coming off and it's hard to close and shut with ease.
The furniture is holding up fine, but over all it seems cheaply made.
Not that impressed.
Our 8 & 6 year old grand kids love to play with this, she likes the doll and he loves Olaf the snowman.
It is sometimes hard for the kids to open and close the palace.
The sides don't always stay up when snapped into place when they are opened.
It is very frustrating for the 3 year old to try and play with it.
It looks beautiful when it lights up.
The castle is easy to put together but it also comes apart easy when the kids are playing with the castle.
The sides are always coming off.
There is no question that the kids enjoy playing with the castle.
I believe anything frozen at this point is a big hit.From a parent point of view I would have expected more from Mattel.
Cheap plastic parts that come off easy.
I will fault them for the cost because they are in business to make money and I am sure Disney licensing is not cheap.Personally I would recommend something else frozen.
it's not entirely a lost cause.
as others have aptly pointed out, this thing is incredibly overpriced for you what you get.
comparisons to Happy Meal toys aren't that far off.On the bright side, it was very easy to assemble.
The doors are sometimes hard to open & close but my children just love having an Elsa & Olfa doll to play with.
Their favorite feature was how the castle lights up.It looks as though this toy has been discontinued or no longer sold on amazon.
It's not a huge loss.
My daughter loves the movie Frozen, and hence she loves this Elsa castle.
That being said, it's not worth the price being asked for, but maybe if &#60;40 bucks, would be better.
But yes, if your daughter is into Frozen, she will love it.As is typical with such toys, assembly is sometimes a pain, and you have got to connect the dots.
Be ready for that ;)
My daughter has the large Frozen castle and we're very pleased with it, but thought this might be nice as it's small enough to be easily portable.
She could take it to her Grandma's house or to her cousin's house when she goes to play.It's a pretty little castle and it lights up beautifully, but unfortunately, this is extremely flimsy.
Assembly wasn't too bad - except that things don't want to stay assembled!
No matter what we do, most of the pieces that are supposed to stay attached are determined to be unattached!
And this is just during normal play - nothing rough at all.Unfortunately, this just isn't a high quality item.
My daughter has grown frustrated with it.
It now sits in a corner all forlorn.I go back and forth between one and two stars for this, finally settling on two.
It is pretty and the lights are a nice addition - but the quality has made this one a bit disappointing for my daughter.
My kids were so excited to get thees as a birthday present along with the new Sophia vacation castle toy.We were very soon disappointed.
3 different people assembled 3 different toys in the order that the instructions outlined.Not one of them has stayed assembled for more than 10 minutes, tops.In less than 18 hours since they were opened and given to the kids we have had to reattach pieces more than a dozen times.The plastic parts are sturdy enough and the detailed features and accessories are adorable.But the annoyance of having of having to repeatedly assemble these items is utterly ridiculous, especially considering the price that they are asking for this $5 hunk of plastic.I'm certain they could do a far better job of engineering these toys.
This is the castle that Elsa creates with her magic.
The set was fairly easy to assemble, you add the batteries and snap the back wall into the base, then add the side panels, central cylindar, and the top.
It just takes a little tugging and pushing.
The Sofia Floating Palace playset was much harder to put together.My 3 year old loved it and had fun moving Elsa from throne (in the center), upstairs to her bed, and then around the set.
She struggled to get the 'elevator' to work.
It doesn't work smoothly and gets caught.PROS- Elsa doll comes with the dress that she creates.
It doesn't have the swirls and snowflakes, but it's still lovely.
It's a painted blue bodice with a fabric skirt.
The gauzy overdress fastens in back with velcro.
She has her side braid and a tiara, though the tiara and dress were never together in the movie (she throws away the tiara/comb before creating her dress).
This is a Magiclip compatible doll.- Castle doors can be closed for easy transport, though you need an adult to lock the wings back in place.
You have to move them all the way to the top and rotate them backwards until the slot rests on the ledge.- There are stairs.
That's important because my daughter loves having her dolls climb stairs.- Olaf is included.
He's in an arms-down pose and kinda teeters sideways easily, but my daughter loves him.- The lights are lovely.
It really adds to the feel of the castle.- The throne is designed so that Elsa actually sits in it snugly.
My daughter has a little trouble getting her in there right, but the important thing is that it's not like every other set she has where the doll and chair topple.CONS- I really don't like the 'elevator' and neither myself or my daughter can use it.My daughter moves Elsa around this set and likes it, so that is the important thing.
Anyone that has ever bought anything even remotely associated with Disney knows that just having the Disney name on something means it will be more spendy than it otherwise should be.
Disney just doesn't tend to go cheap when it comes to their prices.
On the other hand, they may, at times, go cheap on the manufacturing quality (or the manufacturers that make the stuff for them may do so).
That may be in effect with this toy more than it should be.Truth be told, I think this could be an adorable item and it would certainly should be something that young girls that are fans of the movie Frozen would enjoy having and playing with, but the build quality is a bit flimsy (or perhaps the words there should say a bit more fragile than should be desired/expected) and it could lead to frustrations for the adults that would have to help support the younger users of the toy.The small Elsa doll/figure looks cute and it would certainly seem to be the kind of thing that would put a smile on a young girls face.
The only real concern that I would offer in saying that is that it is fairly small and could be a choking hazard for a family that had smaller children around.As a collectible display piece (for adults) this item could just be set up and left alone, and it would probably work just fine.
It would be more spendy than it should be, but it would still work for display.
As a toy that would be played with regularly, the fragile nature makes it somewhat less desirable.
If it isn't going to be durable, and won't hold up over time, it is harder to recommend for purchase.If you find it at a reduced price then by all means enjoy.
If your children just can't go without, then again, go for it, but expect you may soon enough hear some cries of disappointment because it has broken more easily than you had hoped.
