Questions:
OK question! I noticed all the Leappad games say internet may be required for cartridge. We dont have internet, is it a waste to get this for my kids
Does this work with leap pad 2?
The descriptions and reviews are vague.  I saw one review that said it teaches shapes and weight. What else does the game target? TIA
this game work in leapster explorer
Does this work with LeapPad2?
will this cartridge work on my leapster 2
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
I was surprised this game seems like more of a video in the beginning.
We had to watch quite a bit in order to get to the game.
So parents, be patient; however, 3 year olds don't seem to mind.
This has more interesting graphics than other games we have--more actual videos.-This game works on all LeapPads, Leapster Explorer, and Leapster GS-Geared toward 3-5 year olds.
(older may get bored)-The games are mostly experimental engineering and problem solving--Focuses on how things work-Features Grover, Elmo, and Abby (favorites of toddlers!
)-There is also an option to watch a video.Entertaining problem-solving game for young ones.
First off, I'm a huge fan of Leap Frog, and I applaud them for adding in so much science content in the past year.
Their games have made math and reading fun for my children, and I love that there are now games that also explore scientific and natural world concepts.
In a few of the games we have, such as Phineas and Ferb, this worked out incredibly well.
With Super Grover, I think the execution was a little less well done.
There is such a narrow band where the child can both understand and think through the concepts being taught, and still be into Super Grover.My niece is three and loves Grover, but had trouble understanding what the game was asking at times.
My daughter, almost five, found the game too repetitive.
The go-kart and pig balancing were hits with both kids.Overall, it's a neat game.
Kids who love Sesame Street would most likely love this game.
It doesn't have as broad a range as I have seen with other Leap Frog cartridges, but it's still a good one.
When I first saw my kids playing the Solve It With Elmo game, I wasn't sure they'd like it.
The initial game of choosing an object of the right weight to launch Super Grover into the air seemed too plain to hold their interest.
But I was wrong.
They enjoy launching Super Grover from his lever and then catching toys with the net.
The game then moves on to other stages where the children solve simple puzzles and are introduced to different types of physics tools like the wheel and the pulley.The game is definitely better suited for 4-7 year old children, but it holds their interest fairly well.
My 3 year old plays it, though she doesn't fully understand it.
My 5 year old enjoys it, and my 7 year old plays it even though I thought it might be too repetitive for her.
As they proceed through the game, they earn more badges and micro-mods.This game introduces children (including my 9 and 11 year old sons) to the science of physics.
My initial assessment of it being too repetitive was wrong, though I think older kids will be turned off by the characters more than the game itself.
I gave this game to my 2.5 year old and I was amazed at how quickly she was figuring things out.
It is hard for her not being used to really playing a game on the LeapPad and what she needs to do, but she is quickly picking it up.
There are tons of prompts for your child where they can just tap on the screen and it will say what they need to do, which I think is great for younger kids with short attention spans.
My daughter was too interested in playing the game rather than actually paying attention to the directions.
The animation is cute though and the game features Abby, Elmo, and Grover - my daughters favorites.
My 6 year old was bored with this game right away, but my 5 year old played it longer than I expected.
I think this game would be good for a 3-4 year old, or a 2.5 year old to start practicing.
For us its great because we have the old LeapPad which my daughter can call her own while my boys have the new LeapPad Ultra tablets - this is probably the youngest game I have seen both in age and characters.
Kids do not feel like they are learning in this game as the games really are great examples.
Like there is one where you have to balance the boat with pigs so my daughter kept dragging them all to one side and the boat would tip, she finally realized to try the other side and it worked.
Great confidence boosting games!
I would recommend this game for any mom looking for a younger game for her child, especially if they are a Sesame Street fan.I received this game to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.
My preschooler can not get enough of this game!
He's just over 2.5 and while he does need some help to navigate certain parts of the game, I feel that by 3 (the suggested age) he will probably be able to play completely independently.
As it is, he is able to play for 20-30 minutes at a time, and only calls me for help here and there.
He played this specific game almost over an entire plane ride!
We are using it with our Leap Pad Ultra and it works great!
The graphics are only so-so, but he doesn't notice at all.
I was totally surprised at how much he plays this game.
We had a couple of other games and ebooks  (the monsters university game, the wreck it ralph ebook) and none of them can even compare to how much time he has spent playing &#34;super grover&#34; as he calls it.
My child is a huge Sesame Street fan.
We just recently got our first LeapPad as an early Christmas gift since we were doing a lot of holiday-related traveling and wanted something we could leave him to handle by himself, rather than one of our tablets.
The opportunity to try this game via Vine seemed like a no-brainer, since he loves Elmo, Grover, and Abby (probably his 3 favorite monsters).He can't get enough of this game!
He does need help from time to time to work through parts of the game, but he's quickly gotten a handle on it.
I was a little disappointed in the graphics but he certainly doesn't seem to mind, and he has a lot of fun both doing the right thing to &#34;win&#34; the game as well as doing the &#34;wrong&#34; to make it fail.As for the age range, this seems best for 3-4 year olds.
I think it would probably be a little elementary for most 5 year olds, unless they are not familiar with electronic games.
For me, the LeapFrog Leap Pad is a great learning toy for children and the games are a huge part of it!
This cute Sesame Street game is aimed at preschoolers, but works for all three of my kid testers who range from ages 4, 6, and 7.
The other games we own are more literacy based so this Solve it with Elmo, Abby and Super Grover game for the Leap Pad is great because it focus on 'STEM', which stands for science, technology, engineering and mathematics  concepts.As far as if this kept the attention of my kid testers, I believe it did!
They picked up the gist of the game pretty quick and seemed entertained.
I personally like this game because of the fun ways it tries to teach STEM and the cute graphics.If your kid likes Sesame Street, they'll probably like LeapFrog game!
It took me weeks to tear this game away from my 3 year old long enough to test it out and give it a review.
It is an exceptionally interesting game with great graphics and valuable lessons.
Before this game my son didn't know about pulleys and levers, and now he goes around pointing them out.
The game teaches cause and effect, and other physics properties.
There are little videos to animate each section of the game and he really enjoys watching them and interacting with the characters.
The stories are interesting and the game is educational and highly entertaining.
I can see this game being a staple on our leapster explorer for years to come.
As he grows the game will grow with him and I love that there is room for expansion when paired with a parent computer.
An excellent game!
"We have two Leapsters currently, a Leappad Ultra, and a Leapster 2.
My kids love using them, so we always like to get the new games for them.
It has really helped out our kids in school with various subjects, and, now that there was a Sesame Street game, we were even more thrilled.In the words of my 7 year old (who uses the Leappad Ultra):""It says that you learn science.
It teaches me stuff I already know about, but I am older than the game's age.
It has be put pigs onto balance, so pigs can get to the pumpkin patch.
Find wheels for Elmo's cart to go.
Find the right amount of weight to launch super grover 2.0 into the tree to get Elmo's toys.
""At first my kids weren't too interested in the game, but that quickly changed.
My son can hardly put it down.
He loves it to death.
It definitely seems to reach them about science principles, which we feel good about.
We have a Wii, but like to let the kids use their Leapsters more, as we know there is a whole educational side that they don't experience with the Wii.From what I've seen of the game, it looks fun.
My kids enjoy it, and it's teaching them science and other skills.
Only a positive thing for me."
My son loved this Leappad game, and he is five and according to him way beyond Sesame Street and all the characters thus involved.
He likes this despite his protests that he was too old for and its educational value disguised as fun in unbeatable.
The fact that this is a science game is what I think won my son's heart, and I have to admit I am super excited about being the main focus.
Most games are reading, writing and math related.
My sons loves science and he definitely noticed that theme.
Also one of my son's favorite I-pad books is There is  monster At the End of This Book narrated by Grover so he loved the Grover aspect of this game.
Overall this game is educational, cute, fun, easy to figure out and use and oriented for those kids excited about science and how things work!
The graphics are pretty good also, though overall I think the Leappad graphics are inferior to other gaming devices.
I got this for my granddaughter's (she's five) LeapPad2.
The game is touted to explore physical science, technology and engineering, simple machines, magnetism, problem solving and logic and reasoning, or essentially what's referred to as STEM.
I think this game would be great for preschoolers.
It teaches kids about STEM-like topics without them thinking they are being taught...it is really well done and ends up being a fun game for them using familiar characters.
it may end up being a bit boring for a 5 year old which is at the end of the recommended age range.
I definitely recommend it for 3+ year olds.
got this for my sons new leap frog and he loves it!
was a little leary of game vs educational level and surprisingly pleased with the game rating as well as mix..on the surface its a game but it helps with decision making, coordination, thinking, and etc.he loves it!
This is just great for my 5 year old kindergartener.
I have a few other Leapfrog educational games and this is one of the best, especially from those that involve name brand characters.
Stuff that features a brand (e.g.
&#34;Disney&#34; or &#34;Thomas&#34; or whatever) can be real iffy because it's more about delivering their favorite character than about delivering a quality educational product.
In this one they also deliver a quality educational product.
The problems are abstract and interesting: really makes your kid think, and still has Elmo to boot.
Great educational tool!
!
My son loves Sesame Street, and Super Grover is one of his favorite characters.
So he just loves it when he turns on his LeapPad and sees Super Grover flying across the screen.
But he becomes increasingly frustrated as he plays the game.The game that my son wants to play the most is a balance game featuring Abby Cadabby.
She hovers above the boat and encourages kids to take items off a dock and place them in a boat, balancing one end with the animals (usually pigs) on the other end of the boat.
In theory, it's a great game.
But the boat doesn't just require that kids balance animals on the two sides of the boat, they actually have to mirror what's on one side to the other.
This is a difficult concept for my son, who actually knows how to balance things in the real world.
It's a little too specific, and in all honesty, it took me a couple of tries before I figured out that the game was calling for an exact mirror of the animals rather than just having the correct number and size of animals on each side.
Once the boat does finally get filled correctly, the child has to navigate it through a river, around little islands.
This is something that he quite enjoyed.There's another game where Elmo has some toys stuck in a tree and needs help getting them out.
There is a little video kids watch to discover what the problem is and how they might go about solving it.
This video just takes too long for a toddler's attention span.
There's a lot of story background that they have to watch before they actually get to the game.
The game teaches kids about fulcrums and levers, which would be great for an older child, but I just don't think 3 year-olds are ready for it.
And the same can be said for most of the activities on this game cartridge.My son much prefers to play withLeapFrog Explorer Learning Game: Disney Doc McStuffinswhich is much more intuitive and allows him much more success.
We got this game for my daughter for her new LeapPad on her 3rd birthday.
She has never used an electronic device of any kind before, as we've tried to keep her away from such  things for a while.
Unfortunately she has a five year old brother with a LeapPad, so she has been quite envious of it for some time.
Since this game said it is for 3-5 year olds we figured it would be a good fit for her.
I played with it for a while to get a feel for it, and then let her have at it while I watched over her shoulder.
It's a great game with lots of interaction and video, lots of easy little games that are fairly intuitive.
However, for my second-born child who JUST turned three, and has never held anything electronic in her life, this game is way too advanced.
I think she'll love it and have fun with it when she's four, but for now it's too far over her head.
This game introducing your preschooler to math and science concepts they will need to know when they start school.
It's a little difficult for my young 2 year old but he does well with help from my 6 year old.
My 6 year old has no interest in the game or subject matter.
I think this game would be perfect for 3-4 year olds but most 5 year olds would not be interested in the Sesame Street characters.
This game is great.
I give it 4 stars in comparison to other LeapFrog Explorer games, which have all been high quality.
I think it really lives up to its claims of teaching problem solving and physical science.
Kids get to play with the concepts of balance, weight and simple machines in ways that make sense to them.
While Elmo gets top billing in the name of the game, Super Grover is the main character.
Though he's not as popular, what Sesame Street fan doesn't love Super Grover?Solve it was a huge hit with my son initially and then I think he got a bit tired of it; if it has a downside it's that it's a bit repetitive/light on content.
There are just three short scenarios to play through.
However, the young target age probably means the players will be fine with doing the same things again and again for awhile.This would be a good game for any child who's old enough to use the Leappad but not to old to be a fan of Sesame Street - so the 3-5 age range is about right.
My 2.5-year-old has a LeapPad1 that he loves.
He also loves Sesame Street, so I thought this would be a great addition to his apps on the LeapPad.
I installed it for him and just let him pick when he wanted to play it.
He had so much fun with it.
He figured it out all by himself and had a blast with it.
All four of my kids who are able to use theLeapFrog LeapPad Ultra Kids' Learning Tablet, Greenlove this game.
They range from ages 2 to 7.
They can easily put it into the LeapPad Ultra themselves and play independently.
They love Super Grover and Elmo, so this game was an instant hit, just based on the characters.When we started using it, the LeapPad Ultra stopped working and needed to be plugged into the computer (for the first time) for an update.
It could be a coincidence that it was necessary right as they started playing the new game.
Not sure.I'm not a LeapFrog fan.
I find their games overpriced and they revamp and make things obsolete too quickly.
But my kids do love the products, so I have to give them credit for that.
LeapFrog Explorer Sesame Street Solve it with Elmo, Abby and Super Grover 2.0 Learning Game.
This is a fun game with lots of different activities.
My 5 year old grandson loves playing all the games and didn't need any help.
My 3 year old granddaughter needed help to figure out how to play the games and move to different areas.
Some of the games were to hard for her now but she will grow into them.
The games teach hand eye co-ordination, recognizing objects, following directions, different shapes.
Many science ideas were introduced in these games.
The kids do enjoy them.
Never get tired of these Leapfrog games and toys.
Both educational and fun, this was no exception.
It was easy enough for the 2 year old to mostly navigate and he enjoyed putzing with it for a pretty long time.
We have the Leapfrog Explorer and had no issues working it.
Cute mystery for problem solving and additional learning with characters they love.
I won't bother going through its features since they're detailed in the bio, but it was everything it advertised.
No complaints.
"Our 4 year old has a LeapPad2, which is one of the various platforms that uses this game.
It's all about your child being Super Grover 2.0's sidekick and helping Elmo and Abby with different tasks.
It's very easy to use-my daughter figured it out with no help at all.
It's got fun games that are also educational.
It's a lot about balance, leverage, magnets, and other basic scientific principles.
After every game your child is awarded a digital sticker for their ""Wall"" in the game.
For some games, they receive a piece of a larger gadget machine as well.
Overall, this is a great educational game for kids about 4-5 years old, but would be boring for older ones."
This is a nice little learning game for the 3-5 year old child.
Elmo and friends lead your child in learning science and math.
An older child would probably get bored with the game, as there are only so many things you can do in it, but a 3-5 year old who is a fan of Elmo would enjoy this.
Your child thinks she playing, but you know she's really learning.
We have had lots of leappad games and this fits right in with what we have come to expect from our games.
Sesame Street solve it is educational but mostly my kids find it to be lots of fun, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) concepts are introduced and run seamlessly with the game.
I really enjoy sitting with my kids and watching them play this game, I like seeing them get the concepts when they encounter them.
It is very age appropriate.
If your child loves Sesame Street, they will love the game.
My daughter who is age 7, still enjoys playing it from time to time.
I love the fact that although kids love playing it and that they think of it as a game, it is very educational and helps them with Physical Science, Logic and reasoning, Problem Solving, and engineering.
It is a very nice game and worth getting.
I would highly recommend this.
This has been very popular game with my kids.
Not their absolute favorite, but they have played it more than some others we purchased for their Leap pads.As an adult, I find the &#34;voices&#34; in this pretty annoying.
If that kind of thing gets on your nerves, you may want to shop for something else.
This can get old pretty quickly, especially on a car trip.As for the content of the game, I can't honestly say much.
I didn't play it, but for my kids, ages 3, 5 and 7, it's been well loved by all of them.
My son still loves going to Sesame Place at 5 so I wasn't too surprised that he loves this game (and the Doc McStuffins)  over the other leapfrog explorers.
This is more of a &#34;how things work&#34; than the other basic shapes, color ect...learning games which for me, is a wonderful addition to his set.
Most of the favorite characters are present and the songs and graphics are excellent!
Recommended to the 2 to 5 year old.
Fun fun fun, it keeps the young one happy and he learns along the way.
I can't say that I honestly spent a lot of time playing it myself but I do know that my son has spent enough time on it to tell me that it's not boring and he is having fun and learning.I have looked at the screens as he plays and it's pretty impressive for a kid game pad.
My hat goes off to Sesame street an LeapFrog for making another great product.
We have a LeapPad Ultra and as it really doesn't have many games on it, we are glad to get a game cartridge to have something that is more substantial.
As you would expect with Leap Frog, the game is very educational and appeals to kids.There are three basic missions on this game that can be played over and over (which also get slightly more challenging each time too).
They include identifying round objects flowed by go cart game, a balling challenge followed by a boat game, and identifying something the weight of Super Grover followed by a catching game.For completing a mission, the reward is a sticker or a part of a super duper machine.
And to get all the stickers and machine parts will take a lot of time, so it will be enough to keep your child busy for a while.Although kids exposed to games more often will pick up on this easier, I think many 3 year olds will find the game too challenging.
This is a great way to introduce kids to basic science concepts.
The LeapPad games have been very hit-and-miss for my 3yo, since that's a difficult age to code for.
They games are often either too complicated or too basic, but Sesame Street Solve It straddles the line very well.
With some search games, some problem-solving, and some guiding encouragement from Elmo and team, Solve It is the first LeapPad game she's played for more than a few minutes and the first she's requested again the next day.The game is divided into mini games and puzzles which are well-geared for the 3yo and 4yo attention span.
They teach problem-solving and observational skills, both of which are critical development points for that age.
In all it seems like fun and my 3yo  thoroughly enjoys it even though she only peripherally knows the characters (we're not big tv watchers).
It's definitely one of the best LeapPad games for this age.
I recently tried this game out with my 2.5 year old on an airplane trip.
He absolutely loved it.
There were tons of fun clips from Grover 2.0.
Some of the games were over his head, but they were perfect for my four-year-old.
The games were fun and educational and featured my boys favorite Sesame Street characters.
I don't think they even realized that they were learning while they were playing.
It kept my sons occupied on an entire leg of a flight.
It has been mom-tested-mom approved.
My boys have  loved it and so do I!
This game actually contains three games: 2 with Elmo and 1 with Abby.Unfortunately, you have to watch the tutorial for each game EVERY time!!
There is no way to skip and just play the game.There is a handful of clips to watch of Grover 2.0.
(Grover 2.0 is just like on Sesame street.)
There is a fun part after a game is completed where the child earns a sticker or a part to a side game like a marble maze.
You get to choose how to clear off confetti that has collected in celebration of earning a piece of game or sticker.
You can shake the console like the etch-a-sketch, use a leaf blower, speak into the console to tell it to erase, and other ways.So if your kid loves Grover, it's a great game.
Kids don't mind the repetition of things like watching tutorials over and over.
The only way around watching the tutorial is if you don't switch out of the game - if you choose to keep playing instead of getting your prize after completion.The games are great for this age range.
They progressively get more challenging as they continue.
Plus, it's educational - like you expect from Sesame Street.
