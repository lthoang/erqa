Reviews:
My 3-year-old grandson loves playing on the LeapPad 2.
He calls it his &#8220;iPad&#8221;.
He enjoys walking around the house and taking pictures, and then editing them in the art app.
We'll do just about anything to keep little ones entertained, right?Things that I personally like about the LeapPad 2 are: I like that it&#8217;s educational and he can learn to trace his letters, how he can learn to hold a pencil by using the stylus that is included, and the free app that he chose teaches him about other countries.Things I don&#8217;t like about the LeapPad 2 are: That it seems like you can take as many pictures as you want.
I wish they had a set amount (like 12 or something), so when I go through and delete pictures, I&#8217;m not scrolling through page after page.
I absolutely think that the prices on apps are ridiculous.
I&#8217;m not spending $25 on a Jake and the Pirates app even though he LOVES Jake and the Pirates.
So, I guess that's one of my limits on keeping kids happy.
It needs to be inexpensive or very well worth it for the price of those apps.
Oh, and I think the battery compartment needs to be secured with a screw.
Not very safe for a 3-year-old to be able to pop out the batteries.This says it&#8217;s for ages 3-9.
I definitely think it&#8217;s more of a 3-6 years age range.
I can&#8217;t see an 8-9 year old enjoying this.
Overall, I give it 4 stars, even being pink which some might consider a &#34;girly&#34; color.
It's functional and if you hate pink, you can always use one of the enclosed skins to change the look.
It&#8217;s a fun toy and worth the investment.
This is a solidly built piece of hardware.
The screen is clear, the stylus is accurate, and it includes a front and back camera of decent quality for a kids &#34;tablet&#34;.
The sticker skins are cute but not really necessary.Installing the software on my Mac was a breeze and purchasing 2 not so expensive games for the kids to try out was a breeze.I helped the kids create their own profiles and they were able to do the rest by themselves.The batteries ran out pretty quickly and I had to scrounge up some rechargeable batteries to use.Overall I'm not sure I'd recommend this.
I think the games on a Nintendo 3DS/2DS are better for the money, or even getting an 7&#34; android tablet with all the free games/apps would be a better choice, and the additional games would be more cost effective.
My kids see a commercial for some great new tablet and start the begging and pleading for it even though they already have a VReader and already have an Inotab and already have whatever else was popular last week, but these became available and I figured, why not.
I might as well dip in and see if they are worth snagging.I have some issues.I&#8217;m tired of these tablets pretending to be these great learning tools when their games are pretty standard generic and cheap and don&#8217;t really compel the mind to dig deeper.
I mean, they can&#8217;t hold the interest of a child because they don&#8217;t challenge the mind and they only repeat a series of tasks that are essentially pretty boring.
So, as a learning tool, I don&#8217;t see the appeal here.
What is provided on the actual tablet is minuscule (like, two games) but the games available for purchase (none of the aps are free, sadly) are extremely dull looking.
The cartridges, which have a little more going for them, are pretty pricey.The camera is terrible.
They all are.
The camera on the Inotab was worse, I think, but this isn&#8217;t much better.
I&#8217;m glad that it has a front and back camera, but I wish that the pictures taken and the videos recorded weren&#8217;t so cheap looking.
The &#8216;fun stuff&#8217; you can do with the pictures are pretty lame too.The same old same.The draw here are the sticky skins you can put on your tablet to customize it, but they are cheap and don&#8217;t stick very well.
The fact that this doesn&#8217;t have a rechargeable battery or A/C adaptor and pretty much eats through your batteries in a single day (my kids are notorious for leaving these things on for the whole day) is a nuisance to say the least.It may be cheaper than buying an actual tablet (like a Kindle Fire or iPad) but is it really worth it?
This is a well-thought out, educational, fun, easy to set up tablet for kids!
I ordered this for my daughter, she's at the young end of the age range for the LeapPad2, (it's recommended for ages 3-9) and I'm excited because I know she will have fun with this for years.Setting this up was very easy.
You just pop batteries in (it takes 4 AA batteries) and enter your child's information.
Then you plug it into your computer and set up an account online with LeapFrog's website.
After that you are able to download the free apps that come with this tablet.
Plus, once your account is set up you get emails from LeapFrog notifying you when they are having sales, if you would like to buy more apps.
Most of it happened automatically when I plugged it into the computer, which really made getting started a breeze.This LeapPad came with a total of 9 apps to get us started.
There's a calendar, a calculator, a front and rear camera (so your child can take pictures of themself and others), a video camera, a photo editing app, educational songs, etc.
I was allowed to choose one free game app online.
I also purchased 2 LeapPad game cartridges, and all you need to do is pop them in the opening at the top to begin playing.It's very user friendly.
Young children will need some parental help getting started but they will quickly figure out what to do.
If your child is a budding photographer they will love taking and editing their own photos and recording their own videos.
The quality wasn't superb on the photos and video, as compared to a digital camera, but I don't think young kids will care - they are excited just to be able to have those features.
The attached stylus is easy to use and it's attached to the tablet so it doesn't get lost.There are some nice things your child can do to personalize this too, there are stickers to put around the front of the screen - your child can choose from 9 of them, and the child can even color some of them himself.
The background of the screen can be customized as well with a child's favorite background and photo.
Parents can check on their child's progress through various educational games they are playing.I checked out the website and there are hundreds of apps that can be bought and downloaded, depending on your child's interests, age bracket, and educational needs.
"We have had multiple Leap Pads in our family for the past 6 months.
Our kids love them, especially the 3 - 9 year olds.
Although I never wanted our kids to be dependent on technology to entertain them, I have found them very useful for car trips, waiting in doctor's offices, etc.
The fact that we can add ear buds or head phones for quiet use makes that even better.The LeapPad2 is a nice size for little hands and is fairly durable.
We have found that the weakest point of the device is the screen.
Screen protectors are affordable and will protect the screen from scratches, chips, and gouges.
Our oldest Leap Pad screen is looking dull from the scratching back and forth that a few of the games require.
We also have a gouge in one of our screens and no clue how it happened.
Well, the 3 year old might know, but she isn't volunteering any information.This Custom Edition Leap Pad includes the Pet Writing App, the Art Studio App, the Photo Lab, Camera, Video Recorder, Calculator, Calendar, Note Pad, Clock/Stopwatch, Music Player, Ebook reader, 10 sticker skins, 11 digital wallpapers, and 1 free app download from the website.
The free app allows you to choose one of three free game options online.
You will need to use the included USB cord to download the free game and any other apps you purchase to your computer, as it does not have wi-fi capabilities (a plus, in my book).
(Only the Leap Pad Ultra has wi-fi capabilities.
)The main thing that makes this Leap Pad2 package different from other options is the 10 sticker skins and the 11 digital wallpapers.
The stickers match up with the digital wallpapers.
The sticker skins are easily applied to the front of the Leap Pad, and they are also removed easily.
Our 3 year old took one off, and the 5 year old was able to put it back on.
My kids did enjoy this learning tablet and it made a cross country trip a little more bearable, but not nearly as engrossing as a kindle HD or iPad.
We found the Apps much, much more limited and while the price doesn't go too far for a real tablet, I think I might be tempted to save the money and put it towards a kindle is I were to buy a new tablet.I respect the position that LeapFrog tablets fill, but with a mediocre camera, limited apps and support from the developing community, the platform is fairly limited in usefulness.
I understand that it's not apples to apples, but I think for longevity of usefulness and engagement, a Kindle fire might be a better way to go.The one thing that kind of differentiates this Leapfrog from others is the inclusion of some sticker that allow you to customize your leap pad to a limited degree.
If I had to choose one of them, I think I would go for the power LeapFrog for the ability to recharge the device.All in all, it truly is an ok electronic gadget, but I think it's worth it to go full blown tablet even for a early learner.
This is not the first LeapFrog product we own here but it certainly is the nicest.
The unit is well made and will be able to take bumps, knocks, and even minor falls.
It's meant for kids.
This is no iPad.
It comes with a software system installed but you will need to spend time hooking it up to a computer, downloading software, and installing apps.
This is why this is not a 5 star toy.
This aspect is a bit of a hassle.
You get a few free apps with is nice and my so has enjoyed playing with it a lot.
The ability to pick the skin and customize it was fun too.
It also does not have rechargeable batteries so you might want to add that to your list right away.
Aside from the initial software time and batteries that unit is great.
Disclaimer: I am reviewing a unit I received for free from the Vine program.This is our initial reaction.
Perhaps I'll revise this review again in a few weeks.Initially it held 2 kids' interest for about 15 minutes.
Then they both gave up and went back to their Kindle Fire tablets.I got the feeling that this is LeapFrog's attempt to catch up in the tablet game, but it's too little, too late.
It has some features borrowed from Nintendo DS, like a stylus (though the screen does respond to finger touch), and cameras with a distort-the-photo app.
It has some features borrowed from tablets.and it comes with a few &#34;skins&#34;, colored labels to stick around the outside of the screen.
kids weren't at all interested, unfortunately.
after a few minutes with the &#34;pet&#34; app they just set it aside, as I mentioned, and went back to their Kindle Fire tablets.It comes with almost no software initially (besides the photo thing and a pet app), LeapFrog apps aren't free like many good Android apps are, and the version I got (the &#34;Custom Edition&#34;) from Vine doesn't even come with a rechargeable battery!
nor an A/C adaptor or cable!!!
You have to feed it AA batteries.Overall it makes me say &#34;how 2000's&#34;....
I got this for when my 4 yr. old grandson comes over to visit, and when he saw that I had this, his whole face lit up.
I had already set it up for him to play with it.
He took it and off he went.
It kept him entertained for about 2 hours, before he brought it over to me and asked me to download more games.
When I went online to get more games, I saw that non of them were free, they were at least $10.
So I told him to hold off and just play the games that were already on it.
He did for a little while longer, then he went to the laptop and played his games there like he always does when he comes over.
I was a little disappointed that he didn't really like what was offered on this tablet.
I think for the price, I could buy him a regular table that I can download free games for him to play with.
I'm not sure this is going to be such a good toy for kids, considering what is out on the market right now.
I consistently like LeapFrog products, and often they really do help my children to learn something.
However, with this tablet, though the kids like it, I find it to be more of a toy than an actual learning device.
It comes pre-loaded with an art studio app, a couple of games, a music app, a camera, a notepad, and new to this more recent tablet, a calculator, calendar, and clock.
I would love to use this as more of an educational tool, however, the apps that you need to buy are not cheap.
In fact, I would save myself a bit of money if I just added educational games to my iPad for the kids to use.
I also found batteries to be used up quickly with average use, which made me desire a rechargeable battery to be included.
The custom stickers I did find cute and fun for a little girl to use and make the LeapPad2 more personal.All in all, a decent product, but requires more spending to make it all that it could be!
It's a little early, but the granddaughter has this for 2 weeks now.
She's 8, and well, so far so good.
For the time being she has left her mom's Ipad alone and has focused on this new attraction.
Love the idea that new apps can be downloaded...don't love the prices of some of them...but then I feel the same way about my smartphone apps.
I don't know if she's explored all of the functions yet, but for now she spends hours away from the TV set and mom's Ipad...those are good things.
From what I've seen so far, 3 years old might be too young unless mom and dad spends time with them during their play with the leapfrog.
As long as they have reasonably price apps, this should keep the granddaughter engaged for a while.
Especially with the library, camera and video functions.
The tablet is well constructed, light in weight and the display is clear (not HD) but good enough for reading and playing.
Based on what I have observed so far, this is a reasonably good investment in your child's development... but don't .... like any device... let it rule out family time and outdoor activities.
At every chance of landing her hands on the phone, my daughter loves taking and watching pictures.
So this is very handy for that.
The art studio aids in enhancing creativity.
My 4 year old loves this LeapPad.
She was super excited to get it and she and her 5 year old friend have played it a ton already.Pros: Easy for young children to operate on their own.
Fun games that keep their attention for a decent amount of time.
Educational and interesting.
Works on many forms of learning.
Great for visual and audio learners.
Interactive, i.e.
You shake the device, or blow into the speaker for various games.
Many games to choose from across the age span.
This is a perfect device to save your iPad or Kindle (android) device.
Further, it is more durable and functional for the age than those other two.
I mean, give a 4 year old an iPad and see what happens.
This?
Easier to handle and seems to be more durable.Cons: This particular package does not come with an ac adapter for charging, it must be ordered separately.
It does use a lot of battery and doesn't shut off quickly enough if the child forgets to power off on their own.
The game cartridges are pricey when compared to other apps/games on other electronics, such as Apple products and Kindles.
This LeapPad is a very high quality tablet for youngsters to enjoy.
For those who have children that already play games on a kindle or other tablet, they may find this a bit too juvenile or boring, but as a first tablet it is colossal.It comes with a lot of nice apps (I did connect this to the internet and download the package of apps and registered it, etc, upon first use).
Most of the content they give you is simple (songs to sing along to, a calculator, a calendar, etc).
But there is a cartoonish and quirky little pet sim where you take care of an animal that you can choose options to personalize, and that is kind of fun to play with in short bursts.
They also offer a free game that you can choose from when you are on their website.
I chose a space game.
They have about 3 simple ones to choose from.On the tablet, there is a little art-like app for making pictures that you can save, and also use to decorate photographs you can take with the included camera.
In fact, the camera is the most fun aspect of this as a base unit.
It takes good pictures and kids love to photograph themselves and everything else!I purchased a Hello Kitty cartridge game for playing on this LeapPad and it was adorable and made good use of the touch screen and the camera as well as being a very educational game.
It helped me to realize the full potential of this LeapPad, and it's usefulness.The format for all software on LeapPad is ultra kid-friendly, speaking directions and gently helping them learn, and celebrating their achievements while making them feel like they are playing and not being schooled.
This is an extremely genius learning system.The tablet itself is very durable and while a little heavy (4 AA batteries carry a bit of weight!
), it is still easy for youngsters to use, and the touch screen works great with the stylus or even just fingers.
The stylus also has a little string attached to it and it clips on to the side of the unit so it won't get lost.I was not personally impressed with the idea of putting all the sticker skins on the tablet but I did find the wide variety of included wallpapers (software) to be very nice.All in all, I think this LeapPad is a must for little ones, especially in the 3-5 year old range because that is a critical learning stage where they can greatly benefit from the way this LeapPad teaches and works with the ones who have not yet learned to read.
It's an excellent high quality tablet that does not cost a fortune and grows with your child as they learn.
Many of the software titles can be adjusted to become more challenging as your child learns and plays which expands their value!I very highly recommend this product, I think it is extremely useful, and especially fun for kids to learn with!
This is a good starter tablet that comes with a few small apps but you don't get anything of real value without buying it separate.
Even the MP3 playing app has to be purchased.
There is an option to have multiple players but the settings remain the same for everyone (which kind of defeats the purpose).
Even my four year old wasn't fooled by that.
My kids played with the camera (and the apps that we added) for about a day after that the use trickled off drastically and gave way to them playing with their other toys.
Even now my kids prefer to play learning apps on my phone.
I didn't purchase this product but got it free for review.
I ordered this product for my 3 year old granddaughter's birthday.
She will like the stickers to customise it and I really liked that it comes with 9 apps.
It's so disappointing to give an electronic product and then find the child can't use it until they buy other products.
This can be expanded but is usable right out of the box.
Now I have some time to shop for more games and programs to keep it fresh.Cons -It takes batteries which is expensive and environmentally unfriendly.Interesting that Amazons price is just suggested retail - I usually come here for the deals.
Grandson loves this and it's rugged enough to hold up to his antics.
Hes 5 and has several games he enjoys.
Leappad systems have been around for a while now and I've always been happy with their products and durability.
You won't be disappointed.
This is a nice product.
This is  such a great tool for kids.
It has an unbelievable 4G of storage (more than my computer)  The kids can personalize it with the different skins they offer.
There is a built in camera.
You can go to the website and download tons of apps according to your child's needs.
It feels like play to them, and what a fun way to learn.
There is no rechargeable battery pack, which is a sown side, nor does it come with a cord.
I think this should be fixed because it can be costly in batteries.
Still this is another great item from Leapfrog
This is the best kid's tablet we have tried so far.
We also own the V-tech Inno Tab 2 but that is nothing compared to this.
My daughter loves all the different skins that come with this pack, they are very easy to change and switch out.
The tablet itself is easy to set up and use and comes pre-loaded with lots of apps that keep her busy.
The screen is easy to the touch (unlike the inno tab) and is a good size.
My only complaint is that it eats batteries, I do wish is came with a charger!
My wife and I gave this to 4 year old as a birthday present and boy did this go over big.
She commented on the pretty colors and was very happy that the LeapPad was pink.
She wasted no time turning this thing on and was mesmerized.
I was impressed at the way the interface was set up so she navigated through like she had owned it for weeks!
Her favorite thing was the pet shop.
She washed the dog a gazillion times and ran out of the shampoo, I guess she likes clean dogs!The product is lightweight, yet thick enough to be a comfortable grip in a small child's hands.
The only problem I had with it was trying to hook it up to my Mac OSX with Mavericks.
It said the software was not available for my current set up.
Hmmm&#8230;but the joy that this brought was well worth it and I'm glad that Emmy loved it.
This kid friendly tablet(4 GB memory for 20000 photos and 70 game apps) with stylus offers several fun activities right out of the box, once you place the 4 AA's(not included).
Like Leap Frog, in general, the potential of the product grows with the purchaseable, expandable items.The opening page allows several users to feature their names, picture, background and preferences.
Our girls(ages 7 & 10) love playing with the pets, taking photos, videos and, especially, doctoring the photos with silly stuff such as moustaches, flowers, dresses, etc.
The photo lab allows coloring, stretching, magnifying, B&W; the picture, add paterns, e.g.
pawprints, and to save them to each persons' file.
The personalization is the favorite with the kids, spending endless time going through endless options.Onboard, they include a games on &#34;Petpad&#34;.
e.g., where one washes and cleans the pet(by blowing into the microphone-sounds like a hairdryer) or feeding the pet treats or doing the flingobar(?
)- where one shakes the tablet to charge it up and then chases balloons.
9 apps are also included, but, for us, were slow to download.Overall, there are 10 sticker skins, 11 digital wallpapers, pet writing app, art studio app, front and back cameras, video camera calculator, calender, notepad, clock and stopwatch, music player, learning songs app with 3 songs given,  quick start guide and parental guide.
One needs high speed internet and adobe flash player, basic computer requirements for Apple or PC, e.g., 550 MB free disk space, USB port(cable included) and 1 GB of RAM.One can buy tons of games, apps, and accessories, ad nauseum.The girls find this hugely entertaining.
We regulate and limit the amount of screen time, i.e, TV, computers, games, etc, our children are exposed to each day, to encourage other activities like reading and playing outdoors and being kids; however, these are great for short periods and for travel.
Customize for your own child.
Our children are thrown into the age of technology, no doubt.
I firmly believe this is a GREAT way to start and put off buying them a tablet of their own for awhile.
Let kids be kids!
GREAT apps!
Although I love the game selection, I spent $20 additional and purchased videos, apps and books!
Great value there!
The custom features are fun, but not a necessity!
I love the LeapPad 2.
We own the InnoTab and this beats that!
"For the pricepoint, you are really paying for the LeapFrog brand and the ""opportunity"" to buy a curated (high-price) set of apps designed for kids.
The form factor is OK (almost like a phablet) but the screen size, reliance on alkaline batteries, absence of WiFi, limited number of apps does not make this a compelling value.
Even for a child, you may better off buying a relatively cheap Android-based tablet that will provide access to ebooks and a much wider ecosystem of apps - most of which will  be free.
Plus, it can serve as an occasional back-up tablet for the adult in the family too.
Such a tablet could also serve a growing child through middle school at least and you will not have this tablet gathering dust after 1-2 years.
Overall, an excellent concept -  but at this price point, not a compelling value."
"This LeapPad2 is different from the standard ones in that it comes with stickers to customize it, and matching wallpapers to choose from (although some, like the Monsters Inc. edition, also have special edition wallpapers).APPSI reviewed the apps in my review of Monsters University LeapPad2.
Like that one, this one also has the newer utility suite.
The information in this section is from my review of that product, since the apps are the same.
(Followed by new information about the customization.
)Art Studio App--This is like a little Paint program.
Unfortunately, this is the app where it's most noticeable that there's a response delay with the stylus.
Drawing needs to be done somewhat slowly.Camera--This is a toy-quality camera and video recorder.
It can take photos from the front or back.Cartoon Director App--Kids can make mini-movies, and can use photos of faces to personalize the characters.
Motions are limited and the movies are mostly narrative, but it's still a great way to exercise creativity.Learning Songs--A few LeapPad educational songs.Pet Pad--This app helps teach kids how to write letters with the help of a personalized pet.
Letters correspond with pet tricks.
There are also activities, including bathing, feeding, and making the pet ""fly"" to collect balloons by shooting it in a slingshot.Photo Lab--Photos can be manipulated and edited.Utility Apps--There are also some new included apps that don't appear on earlier versions of the LeapPad2.
Those are:* Calculator that can accommodate eight digits.
It adds, divides, multiplies, and subtracts.
* Calendar that has ""stickers"" for marking important dates, and will also allow for ""typing"" in notes that get added to it as sticky notes.
* Clock/stopwatch, with analog and digital readouts, along with a count-up stopwatch option.
* Note pad, where short notes can be ""typed"" onto a sticky note.
"I got this for my grandchildren to  use when they visit.
It is a HUGE hit.
We had to limit usage time so the next person could use it.
It was in use the entire day.With grandchildren ages 3 to 11 it is great to find a single toy that the entire age range can use and enjoy.
The 11 year old likes the calendar, the 8 and 9 year olds loved the photo lab- manipulating the photos was the biggest hit.My 3 year old grandson was able to play- and never wanted to give up the LeapPad after discovering this game- the pet pad.
He got to take care of the petPet Pad- a pet meter at the bottom of the screen lets you know how happy your pet is.
With various activities, you keep the pet happy.
One activity had the child select a letter that he then has to trace correctly with the stylus to keep the pet happy- your child learns his letters and the pet is great entertainment while it's happening.
The letter is the first letter of the word that the pet then acts out.
For example: Tracing the letter ""V"" the pad spells ""Vibrate"" and the pet shakes all over.
""F"" and the the word ""Freeze"" with the pet suddenly encased in a block of ice.Camera- Fun stuff!
Little kids can take photos and videos and then have fun manipulating them if they want or simply store the original in a file.My Stuff- Just what it says, store your own photos, pictures, stories, etcMyBooks- You need to go online and download your own, no books come with the pad.Music- Five songs come with the pad.
You can download moreArt Studio- draw your own, picking the brush, pencil, pattern, colors, thickness of lines- It's a great app and then they can be saved in a fileCalculator- Simple calculator like you see on any phone- easy to use.Clock- Gives and says the time, and has a stopwatchCalendar- Shows a calendar and when opened tell the day and date.
Child can add icons and write in events on the calendar with a qwerty pad that appears when you click on the date.
*If the clock and calendar are not set to the right date and time go to the parent settings- When the sign in menu displays, press the volume up and Home button at the same time.A few little things that were not great:It doesn't come with a cable that allows you to play without batteries.The photos etc get put into a file that all users can access.
My granddaughter didn't like that her brothers could access the photo and photoshop them or delete them.We have a lefty and the stylus is attached on the right side- with no way of switching it to the left so the attached stylus string always was stretched across the pad for the lefty interfering with the screen."
This is our first foray into the world of tablets.
I like that the unit is durable and meant to last.
It does't appear that the older cartridges that our friends have are compatible.
My child just turned 9 and finds it very enjoyable but burns through batteries very quickly.
I am unable at this time to upload the intended features since our windows computer is super low on memory and our best functioning computer uses Linex which is not compatible.
Wish there were protective covers for the actual screen instead of just the decorative skins.
Liked that the customer service was even available on Presidents Day.
I'll be looking for a better power option.
I let the group of cousins, aged three through seven play with this.
The six and seven years olds thought it was too babyish and they wanted to play with my kindle and iPad .
They are trying to learn Chinese via an app.
The younger kids had lots of fun taking photos of them selves.
the also liked the kitten pet game.The unit comes with paste on sleeves , two of which you can color yourself and one is plain white.
There is also a  USB cord to connect to a laptop or PC so you can download other features.
No case is included and no batteries.
You will need four AA batteries.
Set up is easy for up to three users.
There are also online parental settings.
No wifi connection available with this model.I think the younger five year olds are the best age for this.
