Questions:
Does this set come in a retail box?  Or just a brown amazon box?
Would this be appropriate for my grandson's 3rd birthday?  (I know that the recommended age is 5-12, but he really loves cars!)
does this set include any hot wheel cars?
My daughter loves this and she wants to know why Amazon is calling it "do it yourself fun for boys."
does it come with that little plane pictured?
How wide are the individual tracks?
does this set have propulsion?
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
Honestly, the only problem I had was actually opening the box!
It was super-mega-glued!
Once it was open it took a scant 5 minutes to put the track together.
There are 6 stickers to place.
I agree with the instructions -- much easier to do when you're starting.The new track joiners are a great addition.
They slip between track sections and are quite sturdy.
I know this because I had to undo one section and it was not easy to get them back apart.
I'm hoping that means my sons will leave it together.
There are 2 lengths of track and it's very clear on the instructions which goes where (when you read the instructions....).The platform is sturdy and has places for 5 cars to start.
The platforms are marked as A or B on them so they're easy to figure out which goes where on the instructions.The cars are launched by pressing the red flag at the top of the tower.
Two tracks race together through a flag, one launches a rocket, one goes through &#34;a ring of fire&#34; and one is just plain.
There are 6 places at the bottom of the track to join additional track lengths and sets.My sons are already playing with it as I type this review and I'm loving hearing the laughter!
Ordered this and also received all the add-on's below for review.
Had to clear a large space, just to set it up - but it was so worth it.
I first purchased a Hot Wheels kit for my grandson when he was about 3 (he's now 7) and both he and his younger brother have spend many a hour at Gammy's house playing with it since.First of all, this was super simple to put together.
Much easier than the old track.
Don't think either of the boys will have a problem with it.
(Because, yes, I'm taking it down after the better half gets home and has a chance to play with it too.)
I've been playing with it myself for the last several hours and am amazed at all the tricks on the tracks.The tracks themselves, as well as the other accessories seem to be even more sturdy than the original set I bought years ago, so I have no doubt that this set will last the boys for years (seeing as they only get to play with it when they visit.)
The new style of track connectors, I think will be even easier for the boys to connect.If you are looking for a great hot wheels set, you can not got wrong with this starter kit.
Even it alone, will provide plenty of action for the young man in your life.Accessories that are bound to be absolute fun for the boys to play with.Hot Wheels Track Builder Essentials Curve PackHot Wheels Track Builder Triple Blast Alley Stunt PackHot Wheels Workshop Straight TrackHot Wheels Track Builder Digital Speedometer AccessoryHot Wheels Track Builder Deluxe Quick Kick Loop Stunt SetHot Wheels Track Builder Essentials Launch Pack -Hot Wheels Track Builder Crossroad Crash Stunt PackHot Wheels Track Builder Deluxe Daredevil Drop Stunt SetHot Wheels Track Builder Rocket Launcher Stunt Pack
The tower itself is a great idea to launch the cars without having to start from a table, chair, couch etc in a way that multiple cars can be released at the same time.
The new track connectors make the track stick together, where even I had a hard time taking the track apart.
The shooting plane and the finish line pieces are nice to have in the set with the track .As mentioned elsewhere, you need to purchase some additional pieces to have fun with this set.Recommended additional add-ons:Quick kick loop, launch pack, curve pack, straight tracksMaybe:Crossroad crash, daredevil drop (the dropping car has a hard time going straight after the crossroads)Don't bother:Triple Blast Alley, rocket launcher, speedometer (just prints some digital numbers)
My little man is 4 years, the perfect age to get into a Hot Wheels track.
I have been waiting for an excuse to get back in the track that I loved so much when I was a kid.
This kit is a surprising good start for very little cash.
I suggest buying one piece at a time to spread out the fun.
Even with this small kit my boy is entertained plenty.
This then gives me a chance to later pick up a small addon and revive the fun.I have always like the materials Hot Wheels uses for the track.
I like how they have kept the quality in the product, just like I remembered.
What is nice about the track material is it is tuff and bendable, can survive my little mans stomping feet ;)I noticed they did change the track linkage ... and for the better.
They now offer a little button like release.
My little man had no problems figuring it out and now can change the tracks himself.I was happy to see that I was able to take my time and let my little man put the kit together.
We followed the instructions together, putting the kit together was just as fun ... well more fun for me since I can see my little man developing his motor skills as he is putting the kit together.In short I recommend this kit.Happy Shopping!
This track starter set is easy to assemble and fun to play with.
It is even better when you add some of the accessories that are available.
The boys set this up quickly and had cars going everywhere.
In addition to the cars shooting down the tracks, a rocket and a plane launched.
What fun!
It is a great toy for several kids to play with at one time.
After playing with the basic set, we added the speedometer, which I think is their favorite part.
The boys claim we had a car moving at 584 mph!
Another must have part is a launcher.
The Quick Kick Loop gives cars a boost of speed and is great fun to watch.You can set this up any way you like and change it and try new things everytime you play with it.
You do need quite a large area to play with this.
I think it is the best race set we have ever had.
This is an incredible starter set for hot wheels.
Our kids have a few of the add ons and they play with it all the time.
The set is durable an fun.
Our 7 year old and 5 year old boys play with it after school every day for the past few weeks.
They have 100s of cars to go along with it all.
Hot wheels is a staple of our home.
Great toy, the quality is what you would expect from hot wheels brand but it's a great starter track that connected to the hot wheels I already had so now it's one HUGE  track.
You can connect different sizes loops an use different cars so it's always entertaining .
My younger child was supposed to be a boy.
My wife's second pregnancy was 180 different and everyone seemed to think we'd have a boy.
But after the ultrasound, we prepared for a girl and she is about as girly as they get.
Except for cars.
During a recent event, she was able to select any prize and chose a Hot Wheels set.
That was all I needed to re-enter the world of Hot Wheels.When this appeared on my list, I did not hesitate to select it.
Simply put, it is everything expected and more.
Mattel included multiple optional packs that really take full advantage of this set.
We have really enjoyed playing with the looper, speedometer, and much more.
The quick connect and disconnect are a great improvement from the old style that I remember.My only complaint about this tower in particular is there is no easy way to disconnect tracks from some of the launchers.
I wished they had pushbutton locks like other pieces.
I have ended up peeling the tracks off the launchers or leaving then connected and disassembling the other parts.
In terms of launching these miniature vehicles, this does a great job and we like the multiple options that are available.
My children, despite loving their Barbie dolls and stuffed animals, will gladly spend an afternoon devising all sorts of new tracks.
This tower track started kit is fun.
I put it together quickly with picture instructions.
You snap the car placers first, then snap on the track.
The track connect to the tower with small dots to hold it in place once secured, and track to track with blue extention pieces.
While 5cars start on the tower at once, only 1 car is included in this package.
Press the top of the tower and you send 5 cars shooting down the tracks.My dad, child's dad, and sons had a great time playing with this hot wheel set and the many add ons.
We have many more car sets, some new, and some classics that were held on from my child's father's childhood.
So while they are plastic tracks, they hold up.Sometimes the cars go flying, but that only adds to the appeal.
The clean up is easy and weve designanted a storage box for all things hot wheels.
My boys can play with this for a significant amount of time and always go back to it.
We moved it outside for by the pool play during spring break.
Its so light and easy to transport.With all the add ons sold seperately, I still find Hot Wheels to be reasonably priced.
Specially since they last for generations.
We used this set and several accessories (listed below) as an outright bribe/reward to get our 3YO to do his business in the potty.Right or wrong (most likely wrong), I was probably just as excited about the fact that we would finally be able to open this massive setup and play with it, as I was about his pottying.When that joyful day came, and all the hoopla about the toilet was over, we went straight to the &#34;big box o' cars and track&#34; that had been waiting patiently, to be played with.In addition to this starter set, we had several plain track pieces, the airplane launcher, the rocket launcher, the Quick Kick loop, the digital speedometer, the Crossroads crash stunt, the Daredevil Drop stunt, Triple Blast alley, the launch pack ,and the curves pack.
All told, when put together, this thing is MASSIVE, and so dang impressive.But of course we were too impatient to build the whole thing before we started playing with it.
In fact, we started off not even using this starter set, because we had so much fun with just the Daredevl Drop + Crossroads Crash +Quick Kick Loop (by far my favorite).
We lined all those pieces up in one long line, starting on one end with the Drop, for velocity, then by the time the car hit the Quick Kick (which propels the car around the loop) - it was FLYING.
:)  So awesome.Later, when we put the whole thing together, it was almost overwhelming.
In fact, you have to stand back a little to see everything happening, if you launch multiple cars at once from the center tower.Matchbox/Hotwheels sure have come a long way since I was a kid when we just had the yellowish orange track with the purple &#34;tongues&#34;...maybe the loops existed back then, but nothing like this!Overall, highly recommend this as long as you realize you need to add some accessories to make this into the massive playset they show on the box.One suggestion - at least for the Daredevil Drop stunt, I found that only the heavier cars worked well, because the other ones would hit the side rail and flip more often than not.
My kids had a blast with this track set.
However, we had a lot more than just the &#34;Starter Set&#34;.
We have a lot of the accessories that are available.Without the accessories, the Track Builder Starter Set is a little &#34;ho-hum&#34;.
You can release 5 cars in 4 different directions.
Or You can race to cars downhill.
Not a lot of variety there.However, with the addition of the loops, launchers, and additional track this set becomes can integral part of a great play experience.I think if they had added just a little more to the basic set, they would have had a great value.
However, as it is, it is a bit disappointing but still good for a little diversion.Overall: 3 stars.
Good, but could use some of the accessories in the Starter Set.
"When I was a kid, I used 2x4's and tin sheets to race my Hot Wheels cars.
I don't know if I missed the track building era or if my parents were just poor as dirt.
It may be that they were poor as dirt.
Either way, I didn't mind using tin sheets and 2x4's but now that I'm a father myself, I realize that I've always longed to own tracks.
I guess you could call it an unrequited childhood experience.
Lucky for me when the doctor caught my child at birth, he said, ""It's a boy!
""Last year I bought the super-6 lane raceway and now I I have the Track Builder Workshop Starter Set, Loop and numerous other additions that basically took up my entire front walk area.
My son, when he saw the boxes started jumping into the air, pumping his fists and screaming, ""It's like Christmas!!""
That alone is enough to put a smile on my face.This Starter set is a pretty cool tower that can branch off into 4 different directions.
One direction is a race between 2 cars, one has a flame hoop and one has a rocket ship that launches when triggered.
All 5 cars can be launched all at once and if done properly can look like an extreme carnival monster truck rally with rockets, (cardboard) flames and checkered flag.
The only thing missing is whistles and fireworks which could be done if your house or desired location is fire proof.
(whistle not included)The best part about track builder is that your child can use their imagination and do whatever they want with the tracks, directions and (cardboard) pyrotechnics.
I love things like this because it is relentlessly entertaining and when one thing gets old, all you have to do is re-adjust and try something new.
I can just see my kids brain bouncing around with ideas as he plays.I love this product and I'm sure it will supply hours and hours of fun for me and my son.
I wish the tracks had a little bit more of a lip or edge to them to keep cars from bouncing off the tracks more often, but that's the only complaint I have.
I've noticed a few reviews that dinged this set for not being sufficient in and of itself, but I find it's really just a matter of imagination.
The launcher stands about 2-2.5 feet tall and allows you to attach up to 5 tracks.
There's a unified &#34;release&#34; mechanism, so you can place 5 cars in their respective slots, pull the release, and watch them all take off.
Given enough room, you can have some really fun runs (though only one really counts as a side-by-side &#34;race&#34;).
I do agree that this is even more enjoyable when you add other sets, but they're by no means required.
The contruction is solid and reasonably stable, though I found the stickers were a bit fininicky (the edges of the flames had a tendency to tear if I was not careful removing them from the sheet).
All told, I'm glad (or rather, my son and daughter are) to have this as an addition to our sets, though I would have been just as pleased to have it as a stand-alone to sit atop the kitchen table and launch Hot Wheels to the four corners of the world (or dining room, depending on how you look at it).
I love this hot wheels track builder setup.
Mostly because it's somewhat free form, you can buy add ons, track, etc and then you and your kids can set it up however you want.
For purpose of review, Hot Wheels sent not just the starter set but a bunch of track pieces and other things to connect this to, which all work great (and the new 2014 style tracks with the half circle cut outs are so so so much better than the old ones -- this item still uses the old style, but it's not all that bad to disconnect them and attach them).This particular set is a tower, the tallest point has two tracks so you can side by side race cars (and a little checkered flag pop up that shows which one wins), then there are three additional heights.
You can stage all 5 cars on the items, push down the top hot wheels logo and all 5 will be sent down at once.
If you get add ons you can easily link them up and get a series of jumps, loops, corners, etc to make a rube goldberg like car sequence.Love that it is all modular, and there are all kinds of fun little things to do with it, and all kinds of open ended add ons.
Great fun for kids, and helps them be creative.
I'm in my 40s and *I* love this thing.
That rather embarrassing confession aside, my little boy also cannot get enough of this track.
That's the least you need to know, it's easy to setup and it's hellacious fun, enough so that your kids will come back time and again to play with it.
For parents, you know this is the gold standard: will it capture and keep the kids' interest before it's tossed aside for a video game or two.I really like the new track connections, which a redesign ensured I kept my fingernails and mind intact.
With truly (truly!)
imaginative expansions possible with purchase--of course!--of other tracks and equipment, it is possible to combine these tracks into a limitless combination of high-speed fun.
Every Hot Wheels car we tried works splendidly and set up, is very very quick.
The jet springing high in the air triggered by the passing car is a sight to behold; if you get enough track and equipment, you can fire off six simultaneous cars speeding down the track, each performing multiple and various stunts!
I dare you to find something else more fun for a 4-year-old.Five stars; now to save up for all those optional equipment!
My 4 year old figured out how to connect the track before I did.
I took it up to school and gave a box full of pieces to my 4 and 5 year old  class.
In no time the track was going all over the room they had figured out how to make big crashes and how to get the rocket to blast off and hit a car.
I think that was the best 3 weeks they had had in a while.
I have promised they will get to use it again before school is out.
Right now the track is all over another teacher's classroom.
They learn so much about how to connect the tracks to the the effect they want.
I feel very lucky we got to explore with a few of the extras that were sent to us.
As a teacher it was a very positive learning tool.
"Before I get into the particulars of this latest concept by Hot Wheels, I have to say I think this is a really great idea for the following reasons:1) The Starter Set is affordable at $25, and is a great set to customize with future stunts and accessories.2) There are plenty of add-on stunts and accessories at a variety of price points, starting as low as $5.3) Everything is easy to put together (except maybe the stickers), and Hot Wheels has improved the way track fastens so that it stays together better.The Starter Set includes the following items:-The Tower-8 x 1' straight track-9 x 1.5' straight track-8 x blue track connectors-1 Hot Wheels car-Ring of Fire track decoration-Checkered Flag (drops the checkered flag on the winning car in side-by-side race)-Plane launcher (as car passes underneath it will spring launch a small plane into the air)-Stickers-InstructionsMinor Add-on Packs: ($5 - $8 each)-Workshop Straight Track Pack (4 x 1' pieces of track + 4 blue connectors)-Hot Wheels Gift Pack (9 cars, start with this pack to increase your car count because you want at least 5 cars)-Crossroad Crash (Provides a crossroad where traffic coming one way jumps over traffic coming the other way, connects to existing track in 4 places)-Triple Blast Alley (straddles the track, 3 archways that launch signs about 6"" into the air when a car passes under them)-Rocket Launcher (cradles the track and launches a rocket about 1' in the air when a car passes through)Major Add-on Packs: ($12 - $20 each)-Daredevil Drop (Drops a car through a 3-way intersection, connects three ways to existing set, provides a 6th launch point)-Quick Kick Loop (2 x 1' track, 2 blue connectors, rubber band powered kicker launches car through loop)-Curve Pack (4 x 1' track, 2 x 9"" track, 4 curve pieces, 8 blue connectors, 3-speed rubber band launcher)-Digital Speedometer (3xAAA battery powered, attaches to track in two places and measures speed - Cool!
)-Launch Pack (4 x 1' track, 2 x 9"" track, 6 blue connectors, 3-speed launcher, kicker launcher)After working with the Starter Set and all of these add-on packs, I have the following bits of advice:-Definitely buy the Hot Wheels Gift Pack (9 cars) -AND- at least 1 x Workshop Straight Track so you have more cars and more track-The best add-on Stunts/Accessories are the Digital Speedometer, the Quick Kick Loop, the Rocket Launcher, the Crossroad Crash, and the Curve Pack.-Definitely have someone who knows how to do a good job with stickers nearby, because every set/stunt/accessory has them-You need an open space of 7' x 7' for the Starter Set alone, and it grows from there.
If you live in a compact space, this set might not be for you.
There are other Hot Wheels sets that are much more compact.I highly recommend this Starter Set concept by Hot Wheels for the reasons I stated above.
You can start small and grow the set into a really nice $150+ set that takes up an entire room and provides hours and hours of enjoyment."
I ordered this for my son who is obsessed with cars.
He is almost two and is able to easily load the cars onto the tracks and make them &#34;race&#34;!
He needs help setting up the actual track but once it is ready to rock he can easily play with it.
My husband and brother in laws all played with this track set with my son and his cousins and I honestly don't know who had more fun.
Everyone loved it, and it only gets to be more fun the more sets you add to it.
This is a nice Hot Wheels track starter.
It contains a single tower that lets you simultaneously launch five cars in four directions with a single push.
Two cars race down from the top and one car heads in each of the other three directions.
There is something like twenty-five feet of straight track included in the set, along with a finish line for the drag race that drops a checkered flag over the lane that wins.
The highlight of the set is the plane launcher, which sends a small jet shooting off when a car speeds beneath it.
This unit really serves as a great hub to which other Hot Wheels track units may be added.
You'll definitely want to add some curves to the set soon, and there are some other fun add-ons available.
I expect my six-year-olds will get years of use out of this.
(As I mention in the title, you'll want quite a bit of space to really use this, since it shoots off in all four directions.
And while assembly is rather easy for an adult, kids may struggle with some of it; and getting some of the pieces apart is certainly an adult task.)
My son is a huge Hot Wheels fan so I was really excited to give him this for his birthday.
I had also picked up numerous other addon sets from the new Track Builder series, which was quite a challenge because they are pretty hard to find right now, with good reason.
This base set gives you a launch point for up to 5 cars, letting you start off a chain reaction on each track.
One track launches a rocket, another flips a flag to show which car crossed the finish line first, and one is just a simple fire ring the cars race through.
The lever at the top launches all cars at once, so it can be pretty fun to see them all go.The true beauty in the Track Builder series is all the addon parts you can buy.
You don't even necessarily need this base set, but you do get quite a lot of track with this set in addition to the new connector system.
The old Hot Wheels connectors were just flat plastic pieces with little nubs to hold the tracks together.
They always held together well, but they were sometimes really challenging for kids (and sometimes adults!)
to pull apart.
Now these connector pieces have little buttons you can depress to make the tracks much easier to separate.The addon parts range from $5 to $10, with one set being $15.
The $5 pieces offer a range of jumps and stunts that can be added to ANY Hot Wheels track that you own.
The $10 sets include a real working digital speedometer that clocks the car's speed as it zooms past and a booster powered loop, among others.
I can't tell you how much fun we had ranking all our cars by speed and giving out awards to our top speeders.
The $15 set is a standalone booster that can be used anywhere in your setup.
These were very hard to find at regular price, but when I found them, I picked up a couple for my son and he has had an absolute blast creating his very own tracks.My long-lived gripe about Hot Wheels tracks is that they are very often big and always hard to store, but my biggest complaint is that they just don't work together with other sets.
At all.
The Hot Wheels Workshop Track Builder Starter Set is - as the name suggests - the ideal starting point for any Hot Wheels play set.
For those who aren't familiar with how Hot Wheels cars and tracks work, the cars aren't motorized so the only way that cars move on a Hot Wheels track is by gravity or by some type of &#34;launcher&#34; (usually powered by a rubber band).The Track Builder Starter Set is basically a big tower with spots to launch up to five Hot Wheels cars.
There are no rubber bands powering the launchers here; it's gravity powered.
You simply place the cars on the blue starting points attached to the tower, then press down the Hot Wheels logo at the top of the tower and all five cars are launched at the same time.From there, it's up to you to add more tracks and expand the play set.
The Starter Set tower is cool by itself, but if your child is like my son then your kid will want more tracks so that the cars keep going after they reach the ends of the tracks that are included with this starter set.I can't give this play set any negative marks because it was easy to set up, and my son loves it.
Sure, it's not a complete track by itself ... but that's why it's a &#34;starter set.&#34;Even though you'll probably want to add more tracks to this set right away, it's a great start since the tower lets you get five cars moving right away along different tracks.
the push rod at the top is fun to see all the cars slide down at the same time.
the tracks are curved naturally due to gravity but be forewarned that if you connect all four track directions, it will take up a LOT of floor space!
my girls really liked this on hardwood floors to see the cars to past the track onto the floor.
First and foremost, Amazon shipped fast, arrived on time, good job Amazon.
I have to admit, I still play with Hot Wheels (I am over 40).
My son is 4, and I have introduced Hot Wheels to him recently.
He loves loves loves this starter kit.
Putting the kit together was very easy, in fact, I still have nightmares about putting those old style tracks together when I was a kid.
Sure, we put firecrackers in our hot wheels when we got older, but that is a story for another review =).
After the install went smooth, we did some Hot Wheel action.
The tower is very cool, and my 4 year old and I were racing his hot wheels in no time (Jeep for the win).
Overall, I highly recommend this set to young and old looking to experience one of the greatest childhood toys ever conceived.
My kids (ages 7years old, 6 years old, 4 years old, and 2 years old) loved this!
I thought they would find it difficult to set up and operate, but once their dad showed them how, they were track building pros.
They have had so much fun!
We use this with other Hot Wheels Builder tracks to create an ultimate fun track.
This is our primary component of our track, though.
They absolutely love it!
They've had Hot Wheels cars for a long time, but I was always hesitant about the track because of mess and thinking they'd be yelling &#34;Mom!&#34; every 10 seconds.
But they can operate this independently and I wish we hadn't waited so long to take the track plunge!
My son loves playing with this track.
We have another set, so he was able to make a larger, more complete track.
I find it annoying because it's constantly coming apart.
This set delivers on the promise of cars doing insane, amazing things: racing multiple cars at once, jumping through rings of (plastic) fire, launching a rocket, and settling once and for all which car is faster.It all starts with the tower.
The tower can launch five cars, two at once in one direction, the rest in all the other directions.
One car rolls through a fire hoop, another launches a trigger that fires a rocket (the angle is adjustable), and two more race along a dual track to a finish line with a flag that indicates which car won the race.
Best of all, adding on other tracks from other sets expands this entire arrangement into a Rubegoldbergian series of dizzying car races in which five cares launch simultaneously into crazier stunts.The track connection system is surprisingly simple -- easy to put together, not so easy to take apart.
It works on a pin and hole system, with blue connectors that branch each bright orange track with the next.
You push the button to remove them, which is easy -- for tracks connection to other pieces like the main tower, this is not as easy.This set does not work as well with other cars.
It's Hot Wheels or nothing.
The vehicles from the Cars movie are too wide.
Cheapo cars that don't have enough weight will not trigger many of the devices that come in the other sets.
In other words, if you're buying this set, spend a little extra money for some Hot Wheels cars.My three-year-old and six-year-old think this is pretty much the best thing ever and have been playing with it for a week straight, experimenting with different cars, different tracks, and different heights.
The only drawback is that we've run out of room to lay all the tracks!
I had a blast with this race track, along with my four-year old racer.
You would have thought it was Christmas morning when I took this out of the box!
My son loves Hot Wheels and this set really impressed him.
Hours of fun and easy to assemble, what more could you want from this classic toy company?
*Please note, this is not a stand alone toy.
You need at least more track and some additional parts for this to really work*That said, I applaud Hot Wheels for making this track builder set.
The problem I was always encountering with my son was he would LOVE the Hot Wheels traditional tracks for two weeks and then get bored with them.
Honestly, they're not open ended toys and once the novelty wears off, my son loses interest.But with this track builder set, when he gets bored he just dismantles it and builds a new one.
This requires so much more creativity and the replay value is much higher.This specific piece is the center.
It kind of has to be because the cars zoom out in all directions so placing it in a corner will only utilize one or two tracks (which is fine if that's what your child wants it to be).
The great thing is all the cars get released at once and depending on the path your child has built, the cars get to traverse through different adventures.Adult supervision is needed, especially if they are on the younger side, and as others have mentioned, you need lots of room.
Like the entire floorspace of your child's room or even a living room.
Once, my son wanted to make a really long configuration so we did it in the hall way.
He then discovered that he made it too long and the cars ran out of steam before they hit any of the obstacles so he learned to make the track shorter.Fun AND educational, this tower (and the track sets needed to go with it) have been a big hit with my five year old son.
I am so glad to see these kind of sets where the kids can build their own tracks.
These are what I had as a kid, and we love them.
The other hot wheels stuff falls apart so easily.
These you can build and add onto according to your imagination.
My son and 2yo grandson have a lot of fun with this track.
It was pretty sturdy on their tile floor.
Both of them love Hot Wheels and accessories.
"Wow, Hot Wheels have come a long way since thechunky tracksof yesteryear.This ""starter kit"" is really built around the tower, which allows you to set up and release five cars at the same time.
The top-most two are side-by-side, allowing for racing which the kids enjoyed most of all.
There's a flag-finish you can set up for these two tracks and whichever car goes through first wins, causing a gate to close on the other side and the losing car to crash.
While this starter kit comes with just enough track to attach to each of the five starting positions, the lowest position is a pretty shallow drop and unless it's connected toa speed kicker, really doesn't have enough vim to accomplish most of the actions.
The second-highest faces the opposite direction of the race start, so removing it made the complex take up much less space.
The kids quickly eliminated those two starting positions and used their tracks for the main race.
The other start position sits just below and counter-clockwise to the race start, and is where we connected the included rocket launcher.Largely, the above makes a good drop-race track, but isn't amazing.
By adding on pieces like therocket launcher,loop, anddrop-crash stuntthe kids became much more engaged (see customer picture).
Unless your home is far larger than ours (which, to be fair, it probably is), I'd definitely recommend getting thecurve pieces, too, so the track doesn't consume your room.
And, of course,some extra cars.What's fantastic is the new track connectors, which are easily separated by pressing the blue tab in the center.
This makes rearranging the track part much quicker and easier than the old slide-together tracks.
Unfortunately the tabs are ONLY on the track connectors and not the core pieces (yet?
), which sometimes serves to highlight how bad the old connections were when you try to swap track on a core component.
The blue-tab is definitely the way of the future and I can't wait to see Mattel incorporate it on all track pieces.Have fun!"
I was eager to get this set.
It reminds me of my sets of Hot Wheels/Matchbox as a kid.
There is plenty in the starter kit for lots of fun.
The tower has five drop points for cars to be released at the same time.
The connections of the track were mostly easy, although not as easy as I remembered.We set this up, and added some of the cool expansion packs.
All quite fun.
This is a fun set that every boy (and probably girls) should own.
We have a daughter too young for this, but I'm excited for her to play as well.Or, you can do what my brother and I did with this set as kids: use the orange tracks to fight with and see who can cause the biggest welts!
