Reviews:
This classic pull-toy is well-made and much cuter than the old dog pull-toy I had growing up.
He &#34;quacks&#34; as he rolls along and my kids have been having a blast with him.
My 8 month old sits and rolls him back and forth.
My 3 year old runs through the house with him.
My 5 year old and 7 year old take him for walks, too.
He's adorable and makes me smile when I see him quacking behind one of my kids.The best thing about him is that though he does quack, it's a quiet, organic, rhythmic sound and not an annoying, loud sound.
Not as annoying as a push-popper toy or the battery-operated toys that fill my living room.
I wouldn't buy him for an older child, but he'd make a perfect Christmas or birthday gift for a 1 or 2 year old child.
I can't wait for my baby to be a toddler pulling him around the house.
If you want to get a child a classic toy they can pass down for generations, get a Brio.
This little wooden duck is so simple and sweet...as baby pulls it along, it clicks, moves its head from side to side and its wings move up and down.
Adorable!Although they are now made in China, the Brio website states that they test frequently and thoroughly to make sure their products are safe and toxin free.
"My daughter LOVES this duck!
It's super cute and very well built.
It's all wood with a nylon string attached.
When you pull the duck, his head moves back and forth and it makes a noise.
She giggles and says ""duckie"" as she's pulling it along.
It's very entertaining for her, which is great for us!
;)My only complaint is that the nylon string is too short.
Sure, my daughter is tall (33""), but it barely reaches her hand when standing.
If they made it a bit longer, this would get 5 stars."
What a well-made toy!
I used to have a pull-duck-toy when I was a kid, centuries ago, but it didn't seem to be made like this.
As soon as I saw it I smiled.
Obviously it is well-crafted.
There are no sharp edges and the weight feels sturdy, not like plastic, but solid wood.
It is just what you would expect from a toy made by Brio.
No real gimmicks, just a fun toy that actually works with only a person moving it, instead of batteries or whatever.
It's very attractive to look at and children are drawn to it.
The quack is almost imperceptible.
The Brio Pull Along Duck is great classic toy.
It is made of wood and is made to last for many years.
It is a great pull along toy for a baby who is walking.
Duck will follow along behind waving his wings and turning his head to and fro.
I love the old-fashioned style and am really impressed by the workmanship that goes into making this toy.
This cute little pull along duck from Brio is a nice classic baby toy for a little one who can walk or crawl.
The ducks head and wings move as the toy gets pulled around.
The little wooden toy is certainly attractive and can make not only a fun toy for baby but also a nice decorative piece in a nursery.
The paint finish on this toy is nicely done and looks as though it will be able to stand up to years of play.
It's certainly a nice alternative to noisy plastic battery operated pull toys.
Another one of those toys that is utterly simple and yet you never tire of.
It's a well made wooden duck that follows your around the room on a string with a quack and a flap and a nod.
Ours also plays legos, is a frequent dinner guest at the kids kitchen and is best friends with a stuffed bear (or so I'm told).
It's a well built toy that provides hours of fun!
"What an absolutely perfectly made toy!
Beautifully designed and executed!
Now this is quality!I was impressed with this duck the minute I saw it.She / he nods her head and flaps her wings as she's pulled along.
She supposed to even give out quacks,but those aren't as realistic as I had hoped for.Although she only weights 14 oz, she's heavy enough that her head & wings work on our thick carpet.Her main body is a full 1 1/2"" thick, the wheels are nearly 1"" wide, she's over-all 3 1/2"" wide.Tail to beck is 6 1/2"" long and she's 5"" high with a 28"" long pull string.This toy should bring a smile on anyone's face.
It's a cheery toy, built with excellence.And like the good old wooden toys of yesteryear ~ this toy should last."
This is a cute, well made classic toy that my niece really enjoyed.
She played with it for quite some time, dragging it around.
I would say for the price, this is a great option for a less expensive item that will still hold up to the &#34;beatings&#34; of young kids.
Overall, very happy with the item.
This duck is very well made.
I was quite impressed when I got it, though to tell the truth it is a bit on the small side.
I love the craftsmanship and paint work.
The duck's colors are bright and glossy and the string is long enough for any toddler to use.
The wings flap and the head bops with no trouble.
The price seems a bit high but it is constructed very well and can't really see this thing breaking apart any time soon!
