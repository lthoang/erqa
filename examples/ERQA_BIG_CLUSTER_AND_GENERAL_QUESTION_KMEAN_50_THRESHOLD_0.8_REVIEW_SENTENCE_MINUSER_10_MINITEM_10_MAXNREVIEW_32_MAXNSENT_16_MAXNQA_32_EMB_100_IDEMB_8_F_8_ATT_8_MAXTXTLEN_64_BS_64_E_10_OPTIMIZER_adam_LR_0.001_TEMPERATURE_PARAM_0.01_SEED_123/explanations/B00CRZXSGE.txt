does Mr. Pencil teach left handed writing
Does this pencil work as just a stylus
Top sentence(s):
There are many apps in the app store that charge you but the app here is free so you are really just paying for the stylus, Mr. Pencil.

Reviews:
Our son has been working on writing for over a year now, and he often doesn't have the patience for it because he gets frustrated by his mistakes.
Even using a pencil, his mistakes on the page are somewhat permanent, but not with Mr. Pencil!
Mistakes disappear immediately and he can try to make the letters and shapes again.
He has done more work using Mr. Pencil in the past couple weeks than he would typically do over a few months for that simple reason.One suggestion for LeapFrog though.
Our son would rather start his letters wherever he wants, rather than in the preassigned location required by the app.
It would be nice if the app could simply sense where he's starting and make sure he stays on the lines from there rather than mandating he start his O's at the top for instance (I typically start mine on the side and write them in the opposite direction from what the app requires).A great product that has helped our son continue to learn and grow and develop, but it could be improved by adding a little flexibility to the app and the way it teaches.
"The stylus itself is easy to hold and use.
I have had no problems with it interacting with my iPad screen.
My sons, 3 and 6, have enjoyed using it and have had no issues with performance either.The app took a long time to download (although it may have been our WiFi connection's fault, not the app) but once it was on the iPad I have had no problems with it.
I've seen comments about it being hard to unlock the content, but I had no problems with it.The game is very similar to the Leap Pad Mr. Pencil games.
It teaches writing and basic drawing skills for both upper case and lower case letters, numbers 1-20 and basic shapes.
It takes you through the town to get it ready for the Art Appreciation Day Parade.
Some activities include sprucing up the fountain, firehouse and museum.It starts with straight lines (F, L, squares) then moves into curved ones.
Once you finish the first 4 locations, the next 4 unlock and so on through the game.It says there is a parents progress checker, but I have not been able to find this function.
It's worth mentioning too that if you have to correct a profile (misspelled name in our case) you have to do so through the app settings menu, not in the game itself.
At first I found that annoying, but now I think that is actually good because the kiddos can't change things themselves like the would do on the Leap Pads.I wish this connected to the Leap Frog Learning Path and I wish it had a way to practice specific letters or shapes that need extra practice.
The only way to do that is to remember where the shape or letter was initially introduced and return there for more practice.
A centralized ""practice"" area would be most helpful.I like that the stylus writes in a thick line.
It has made it easier for my younger son to stay on the sample on the screen.
It will make you start over if you get out of the line.
The app guides the child through what needs to be done on each step of the way.
We haven't gotten all the way to the end of the ""preparations"" but it says there is a parade when it's done.The stylus is soft and glides easily on the screen.
Our 4yo is learning to write, and this had been a great addition.
She has improve so much her writing and she is convinced that she is just playing
This LeapFrog pencil is clear that it works with Apple products on the product page, but I am still docking it a star for not launching with Android connectivity given the popularity of that system...I understand the challenges, but still think this product should be more universal.After that complaint, Mr. Pencil is pretty nice.
After you download the app, which I believe was second in size to only Garage Band on my iTouch (so warning if you are close to capacity already), it is easy to get rolling.
The most complicated thing was making it identify the tip of his eraser for the initial launch.
The actual activities are fun and provide a decent challenge that will not leave your kid ready to throw your phone or iTouch at the wall because Mr. Pencil isn't picking up their downstroke properly.I can't say that the &#34;splash screens&#34; and conversations are the best thing ever, but they effectively help transfer the &#34;action&#34;from one area to the other, so those aren't a major issue for a star docking.I think Mr. Pencil will be great for Apple users, but I hope it becomes more accessible for others in the future.
My 4year old had a good bit of trouble using it on my iphone, but my 6 year old loved it.
I can't wait to try it on the ipad mini!
For whatever reason, the corresponding app took a long time to download.
My 4 year old found the pencil awkward to use.But it does work and it is helpful.
Personally, I believe their engineers should fine tune it a bit.
Otherwise, it's a very good and environmentally friendly way for your child to learn how to write numbers and letters.
My 3 year old just couldn't stop using this.
He followed the instructions on how to write various letters and I can see how proud he wa after he completes a new letter.
The interactive nature of the device makes it really fun and makes the learning to write process easier.
The response to wrong strokes is also immediate, so my kid knows right away when he has made a bad stroke.The stylus is light and bulky enough for young kids to use.
In addition, the stylus doesn't need any batteries so as long as the iPad has power, your kid should be able to use this device.This stylus is very easy to use.
The installation was fairly straightforward.
You go to the Apple App Store and download the free app.
The app was approximately 500MB in size.
Once the app installed, my kid did the rest on his own.
"Just so there are no misunderstandings, all this package contains is a large pencil stylus.
It comes with a ""free"" app.
Here is where the clever comes in.
Mr. Pencil has a pattern on his eraser head.
This pattern is the key to unlocking the complete app.
So, you can download the application and play a demo version, but if you and your child like it, you need Mr. Pencil to unlock it.
I've installed the HD Version on an iPad and the regular version on my iPhone.
They both work well.
I was concerned after playing the iPad version that the iPhone would be too small, but it was fine.
The app is cute and does a good job of teaching writing skills.
(As an adult, you may be surprised at how bad your letters and shapes come out....I certainly was.)"
First let me say that you need an iPhone, iPad or iPod to use this toy.
Then you will need to download the free app from the Apple app store.
I have an iPhone.
This can be used with my iPhone but the screen is so small that I really wouldn't purchase this unless I had an iPad.
I think it would it would work fantastic with an iPad.I also want to say that my children also have the LeapFrog LeapPad and Explorer game systems and there is a game cartridge that does pretty much the same thing as this that works with both of those.
It's also called Mr. Pencil.
If you have that already, then you probably don't need this also.That all being said, this Learn to Write with Mr. Pencil is a very nice learning tool.
I think for what you're getting it is reasonably priced as well.
There are many apps in the app store that charge you but the app here is free so you are really just paying for the stylus, Mr. Pencil.
In the box, it looks like some kind of pad is included by that is just for demonstration.
You are getting the stylus.If you haven't already, I suggest watching the video on the product page.
You can see there what the pencil looks like, the actual size and a demonstration of the type of activity that your child can do with it.It of course is for children just learning to write but even 1st or 2nd graders would still enjoy practicing their writing and the other activities that are in the town of Doodleburg.I love LeapFrog products.
They have always been top quality and have taught our children more than other brands that we have tried.
Downloading the app takes a few minutes, but you can actually try out the Learn to Write with Mr. Pencil App without purchase.
If you have Mr. Pencil, you stamp the eraser end of the stylus to unlock the game.
Make sure the eraser end is flat.
There is an immediate tutorial that tells you things such as &#8220;Be careful not to rest your hands on the screen.&#8221;  You then are asked to create a profile and then you move into your options.I definitely like the activities the Learn to Write with Mr. Pencil offers.
Many of the learning tools I see focus mainly on reading, but the actual physical activity of writing is as important to literacy as the reading.
A little bit of instruction from a parent, caretaker, or teacher is necessary at first to learn to hold the stylus.
The tutorial shows this, but it isn&#8217;t particularly clear.The Mr. Pencil activities can be utilized independently by the child, especially when they need practice writing those numbers and letters.
It&#8217;s a fun &#8220;pencil&#8221; and a great motivator for younger children to learn how to write right along with older siblings who already know how.WHAT A CHILD CAN LEARN (according to LeapFrog):&#9658;  WritingLearning to write gives children the opportunity to use language in new ways for a variety of purpose&#9658;  DrawingAs they draw, children develop spatial reasoning, visual acuity, and hand control - skills which will ultimately help them write letters.&#9658;  LettersChildren who can recognize letters with confidence have an easier time learning letter sounds and word spellings.&#9658;  NumbersChildren learn to count and compare sets of objects and identify numbers as standing for specific quantities.&#9658;  ShapesChildren learn to recognize the defining properties of shapes (such as a square having four sides of equal length and a triangle having three sides) and identify them in different rotationsCOMPATIBILITY:&#9658;  Works with iPhone 4/4s/5, iPod touch (4th & 5th generation) and iPadLeapFrog Learning products and accessories:LeapFrog LeapReader Reading and Writing System, GreenLeapFrog LeapReader Learn to Read, Volume 1 (works with Tag)LeapFrog My Own Leaptop (Frustration Free Packaging)LeapFrog My Discovery HouseLeapFrog Letter Factory PhonicsLeapFrog Letter Factory Phonics
This is such a smart idea!
As a consumer, I think the price is completely on-target and, as a professor, I love the idea of children using technology for (genuine) learning purposes.The concept is fairly simple: Mr. Pencil acts as an easy-to-grip stylus and your iPad (or iPhone) allows your child to practice (stroke-by-stroke) handwriting.
(I, personally, saw more success with the considerably larger iPad; however, I think that if you only have an iPhone, this can still be effective).The stylus tip is super soft and will not scratch your iPad/iPhone (nonetheless, if one is permitting one's child to use an iPad/iPhone, hopefully, all precautions have been taken to guard the screen).There is a progress tracker that allows parents to remain informed ... this is a nice touch.
And, this is what separates the LeapFrog products from other, similar ones: they truly invest in the smallest details.
They are devoted to teaching.Yes, buy this for your child.
Use it as a supplement to traditional learning techniques.
And, at this price, you will not regret your purchase.
The Mr. Pencil Stylus works with a free (iOS-only) app that promotes writing practice through games and puzzles.
The stylus is large but lightweight.
I'd say that kids as young as four would be able to use it - any younger than that, and hand/finger size may hamper its use.
The stylus requires no batteries or charging of any kind (yay!
).The writing practice app is really the backbone of the system.
Note that it's extremely large - I thought that our download had frozen until I realized that it was actually just crawling along very slowly while dealing with the bulk.
Once you launch it, you create a profile for your child - this is nice because you can independently track mulitple kids' progress and the registration process is quick and light (i.e.
you don't need to provide any personal information or email address).
In use, we noticed that the app provides a good mix of instruction, encouragement, reward and correction.
Our son enjoys using it and never complains about it being frustrating.LeapFrog has always made great learning tools/toys for kids in the pre-school/early grade level and this one is no exception.
It's nice that it leverages your own existing tech (iPad, iPhone, etc.)
so that you don't have another item that needs to be charged, configured, etc.
Our son enjoyed using the stylus and the app provided him with frustration-free practice with his penmanship that he always looks forward to using.
My son has had problems forming his letters in Kindergarten due to hand strength and grip.
Many time a very narrow, long pencil makes it harder to write.
Mr. Pencil is easy for him to grip and requires no batteries!!!!
Using the free app on my Iphone was easy after using the 'eraser' to conform we owned a Mr. Pencil.
He is laughing and forming letters as I write this, the affirmations from the software boosting his interest and confidence.
Great product!
The LeapFrog Learn to Write with Mr. Pencil Stylus and Writing App is a fun tool to help teach 3-6 year olds to print, write numbers, and learn to draw shapes.
It comes with an app that has some fun levels to play - to get the full levels costs an additional amount.
Given the cost of the stylus, I think that the extra app charge is within reason if the child in your life enjoys and uses the free levels.I could wish that in the future, the company would add on cursive writing to the app and perhaps some additional complex shapes or other numerical equation formats (for helping with math problems.
)All in all, a great way to help a child with learning the dexterity required in learning to use a writing implement.
"My 5-year-old daughter loves the stylus!
Its use on her iPad mini has gone far beyond just the Learn to Write app.
I suppose it would have been worth the purchase price simply for the pencil shaped, easy-to-grip iPad/iPhone stylus.
She loved the app too, working on it for hours, and completing it.
Her handwriting actually improved, I think, from using this.
She also is more consistent in her style of writing letters and for the most part stopped drawing them backwards.
She was working through this app, and theLeapFrog LeapReader Book: Learn to Write Letters with Mr Pencil Interactive Education Electronic Booksimultaneously.When you purchase this, the box contains only the Mr. Pencil stylus.
You will have to go to the app store on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch to download the app (which is very large, 300-500 MB I believe, so make sure you have room for it).
The app then has you place the top of the pencil onto the screen to prove that you have the stylus.
This unlocks the full app, which will take your child through fun exercises in a variety of ""locations"" to learn how to write common strokes, shapes, letters, and numbers.The main problem with the app was that it took forever for us to get the app to actually recognize the pencil.
It probably took 5 minutes of trying to place the three dots on the top of the pencil just right on the screen.
We finally got it to accept it...and then we had to do it two more times!
This whole process of trying to get our iPad to recognize the pencil three times in a row took 15-20 minutes.
We almost quit a number of times.
My daughter finally stuck with it (I had quit) and got it to work.
This salvaged the stylus from a one star review.
Although the LeapFrog Learn to Write with Mr. Pencil App is only available for Apple iOS (iPhone, iPad, etc.
), you can still use this for other tablets including Kindle Fire and Microsoft Surface.There are many (free) drawing and coloring apps available for other platforms (Android, Kindle, Windows, etc.)
that make good use for this.
It teaches kids the skills to holding a marker/pen/pencil correctly and using it to draw/color.
Our nephew really loved it.
First things first - you need an iOS device for this thing.
All you get in the box is a pencil-shaped capacitive stylus.
If you search the Apple App Store with the title of this product, you can download the app and take it for a test drive before you purchase this product...if you do purchase the product, you can unlock the app to get the full version (or I guess you can pay for the full version via an in-app purchase, but then you don't get the fun pencil...).
Really, what you will see here is a review of the app, not so much the pencil device.This is for a three-going-on-four year old who is able to draw some individual letters but doesn't really get what they mean yet.
He really took to the app quite well.
It's easy enough that after I set up a profile for him (the app allows for individual profiles so parents can track the progress of multiple users) he can launch and start things up on his own.
As for usage, the features are friendly graphics and dialogue, and my son is able to follow along with no help from me.
He does have trouble holding the overlarge pencil though...small hands, giant pencil, uncomfortable kid.
I did have a smaller capacitive stylus handy that he used instead, but then that all kind of defeats the purpose of buying this product...just download and unlock the app, I guess.Anyway, another thing to note is that the app itself seems large-ish.
I installed this on a 1st Gen iPad and it took quite a while to download and install.
Presumably it would be faster on a later generation iPad, but if you're putting this app on an older one prepare to devote 20 minutes or so to the process.Lastly, the actual exercises being done are similar, if not identical, to the writing exercises in other LeapPad products.
One of the older kids has a LeapPad device (looks like an iPad but with an attached stylus) and the exercises were very much the same.
I'd say if you already have a LeapPad, this product would likely be redundant.Overall though, my son received great value from this product and app.
I even caught my seven year old playing with it.
It seems fun for them - quite happy with the product, all considered.
Here's what I like about the pencil: it enforces good habits that just sound like nagging when the parent does it.
Players have to make the lines of the letters in the proper sequence from top down.
There is a bit of lag time between each line drawn, which I thought would annoy my kindergarten son to no end.
It didn't faze him.
In fact, it gave him a chance to regroup and refocus for each line in the letter.
Forcing him to write slower improved his writing, which gave him more confidence.
It also makes the player start over if the line being drawn veers too far off course.
It's pretty picky, but again, my son rose to the challenge instead of getting frustrated and walking away.
It's just enough of a game to keep him working at it.That said, there are some significant drawbacks.
It takes a huge amount of space on your phone or tablet.
And my son finished the sequence in about 7 hours of off and on play.
Your call if that amount of handwriting practice/entertainment is worth the price....The pencil itself is much larger than any pencil a child will use at school--good for a beginner only.
The pencil seems to be made for a 3 year old in terms of size/grip, but my 3 year old couldn't stay on course.
After starting the first line of the program about 10 times, she walked away and hasn't been interested since.
What a  fun tool!
My therapy students love this..especially the 3- 4 years old that are Just  beginning to write.
Such great success for the kids, they want to play with it every time.
The pen is easily held by little and bigger hands alike.
The cartoons are vibrant and the sound is also good.
The doodling is also great and gives a break from letter practice.I am using this on my iphone 4s and even though the screen is small, it still has a lot of room to play.
I'm sure it's even more amazing on a bigger pad.
I wish the pencil had come with a small case but I found something to keep it safe in my bag.
The app downloaded perfectly from the itunes store and was free.Would make a great gift!
My daughter is much more proficient with an iPad than a writing utensil, so this seemed like a perfect match to me.
I'm happy to report that it's better than I had expected.While you can download the LeapFrog app for free, the stylus unlocks a good portion of the program, making it much more diverse and fun.
There's lots of encouragement when letters aren't drawn perfectly, which I thought was great for reducing frustration.
And, the stylus itself is made quite well.The only concern I really had, is that the size of the stylus seems to encourage holding it with a fist, instead of how a person would normally hold a pencil.
But for right now, just getting the letters and patterns down is key, and this is absolutely perfect for that.
When it comes to a product like this, I really have two questions: How effectively can it teach a child to write?
And will it be fun enough that the child will work on the skills voluntarily, or at least happily agree to it?
My child just turned four.
He's bright, but is much closer to learning to read than to write.
My practicing over and over again with him is simply frustrating, and I don't want to push someone that young.
He LOVES the iPad, so the idea of him learning to write using the iPad is promising.It's a bit early yet to see whether this program can make great strides towards him writing, but it seems like it's effectively designed.
The fat stylus seems to encourage him to use an appropriate grip.
It's mostly practice of the letters, numbers, and basic strokes like curves - similar to the tracing practice he'd be doing on preschool worksheets.
But the digital aspect gives him a little more feedback than he'd get from a piece of paper.Mr Pencil might not be competition for some other non-education iPad apps in the fun department.
Our preschooler would pick it occasionally, but not often.
However, it's certainly more fun than practicing on paper so he happily plays Mr Pencil if he's offered extra screen time to do it.When you open the box itself, the only thing inside is the Mr Pencil stylus itself.
He's cute, and has a tip that will be gentle on a screen when used by little hands.
It may not strike you as worth the purchase price on its own, but it unlocks the full version of the corresponding writing app you can download for free.
The stylus and app together seem to be a great combination and well worth the suggested price - as long as you already have a compatible iPhone, iPod, or iPad that you're comfortable with letting your child use.
I had a lot of trouble teaching my four year old how to hold a pencil.
She had this less than a day and is now doing it like a champ!
Finding the activation screen was a little bit tricky on the ipad app - so make sure you follow the directions completely.
Otherwise, this is a great toy.
My two year old is already starting to use it!
This is a stylus designed for young hands.While there is software that goes with this stylus I have my young granddaughter use it with my android device.Considering that &#34;real&#34; stylus can start in a similar price range I found this to be a great price point just for the stylus by it's self.
I think Leapfrog did a nice job with Mr. Pencil and the app as well.
Mr.Pencil is easy to hold and grip, is durable, and writing on a tablet with it is very responsive(better than other styluses i've tried).
I feel that its a bit on the heavy side though for a small child.
But still, overall it is a well made and kid friendly stylus.The app itself is alright and gets kids somewhat interested.
It provides a fair number of activities and also includes a progress tracker which is nice.
The story is basically helping Mr.Pencil decorate parade floats for an upcoming parade.
Overall i can recommend this product, even just for Mr.Pencil , since it a great kid friendly stylus.
"My son is 4 1/2 and he likes to use Mr. Pencil when playing with the iPad.
Even my 2 1/2 year old can use it.
It's quite large, and my son can grip it well.
My older son is learning to hold his pencil correctly, and he does with the help of Mr. Pencil, because he can see that his writing improves when he holds it properly.We installed the Writing App for our iPad, which is free if you have the pencil.
You touch the Writing App with the eraser portion of the stylus three times and it unlocks.I thought the app was nice, but I couldn't find where my son could just work on writing his letters or numbers without having to go through the ""game"" and unlock each section, which is what he'd rather do.
So... it's a got stylus, I definitely recommend it, but not so much the writing app.
There are other apps the stylus will work with.
In fact, I can use the stylus on the iPad as well, but it doesn't swipe pages easily."
My 4, 5 and 6 year olds are all learning to read and write, and it's rare that you find educational products that 1. can actually teach your kids and 2. help keep them motivated to actually use the product if it turns out to be educational.
This product got a big pass on both points!You download the free app and it both teaches and encourages writing skills, congratulating and unlocking levels for successes and offering gentle correction for missteps.
The big cartoon pencil also helps make it fun.
It's probably the best letter writing app we've tried on the iPad, and we've used many!At the asking price, it's a steal!
Love that this product helps with writing.
My 3 year old loves working with Mr. Pencil and the Ipad.
He is not in school yet so this gives him a head start on learning to write.
Right now I let him work with this product for as long as he would like and then he goes off to something else.
Love that it is cute and educational at the same time!
!
My toddler loves playing on my iPad so I was naturally curious about this app.
She recognizes her numbers and letters so I thought this would be a good way to introducing her to writing her letters.
However, maybe she is just too young.
She can't hold the pencil stylus in place as is required to make each letter because you can only make it go in a particular direction.
We still use it, but at 3, she may be some time away from using it properly.
My 3 year old is fascinated with trying to write his numbers and letters, and loves to pretend he is really writing.
Mr. Pencil is empowering him to actually begin writing numbers and letters, and it is easier for him to hold than a traditional pencil.This is great for hand-eye coordination, teaches tracing, upper and lower case letters and numbers with some basic shapes.Now I just need to find a way to find Mr. Pencil after he goes on adventure away from the table.
