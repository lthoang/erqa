Minnie's Bow-tique uses early reading skills and fun characters and animation in LeapFrog's latest game release.In this game, Minnie is getting ready for a surprise party, and asks for your child's help in creating ribbons and bows for all of her friends.In order to collect ribbons and bows, your child must match colors, letters, and word sounds.Skills featured in this game are: blending sounds into words (Phonics concepts), upper and lower case letters, logic, reasoning (help dress Daisy for a party), listening skills, and colors.While this game works on both the LeapPad and Leapster Explorer systems, it is best played by younger children (PreK and K).
It is a game where they are planing a surprise party for Minnie.
This is a good but not great game for a toddler.
There is also a decent amount of narrative throughout the game where characters will call your shop to order bows, Daisy and Minnie will chat with each other, etc.
Yes, this is a girly game, however, due to my nieces, my son does not care or see it that way.

Reviews:
This game takes place in Minnie's Bow-tique, and the kids get to make bows and prepare for a surprise party.
While my two girls like to play this game, it seems a little monotonous to me.
I think there should be a little more to it.
They go in cycles where they'll play it quite a bit, then forget about it for a while.Overall, a cute but simple game.
"My 4 year old daughter loves this game!
She would probably would have given this product 5 stars, but I can't for two simple reasons.
First, the game play seems to be extremely redundant.
The characters say the same thing, the rooms of play are the same - Daisy's dressing room, Minnie's Boutique and the party room.
The only thing that seems to change is the ability to 'make' bows and alter some of the scenery, for example touching the party room's cake will change it into a different style of cake.
The other reason I would not give it 5 stars is the educational aspect which is very minimal.
I noted the game did try to enforce colors ""choose the purple"", etc.
but that was all I noted.
On the positive side, I think the fun aspect of this game is the ability for creativity, although it is very limited."
"Kids will have fun helping Daisy get a party ready for Minnie.
They can decorate the party room, create bows for party guests and explore Minnie's Bow-tique.
It takes creating 4 bows for friends to get to have the party, so little ones won't get bored with it before they have the ""reward"".Also in the store, you can help Daisy get dressed (which teaches color recognition), hunt for Cuckoo Loca when she hides in the store, play a butterfly catch game (teaches eye-hand coordination as well as color recognition), and play Ribbon Roundup (teaches color recognition and expands to letter recognition).
Almost everything in the store is ""touchable"" and will respond in some way.
Most just ""sparkle"" but others do cute things.
The same goes for the party room, it's easy to change and decorate the features in the room for a custom party.The Butterfly Game also teaches phonics by asking the child to listen to the word being said (in syllables) and pick the correct picture to match the word.
I like that because I'm not seeing a lot of phonics being taught in schools and I really think that's the best way to teach early reading skills.
Once the child has identified the pictures, they play the catch game as a ""reward"" for getting the words.Ribbon Round Up is for matching colors and adjusts in difficulty as they play more.
It will eventually have letters to match, but we're still in the colors.The Bow Design Studio also has a small amount of hand coordination skill to it as the child will ""twist"" the bow into shape before decorating it.
The creativity seems to be endless as the child earns more colors and patterns of ribbons each time they create one.There are several Micro-Mods that can be downloaded from the LeapFrog Connect program.
They expand ribbon choices as well as decoration choices.My boys have both enjoyed it and I'm not worried about them playing a ""girl"" game.
They like Minnie and Daisy just as much as Mickey and Donald and laugh at the Minnie's Bow-tique shorts on Disney Jr. just as much as they laugh at the Jake and the Neverland pirates shorts.Don't let the fact that it's a ""girl"" game keep you from letting a boy play it.
They will have just as much fun."
"We have all the Leapster Games except Tangled (returned) and this is one for younger kids, and likely girls.
Bow-making is the only real activity with a few variations.
Don't invite Minnie to your party, she whines a bit and her voice is much higher pitched than regular Minnie Mouse.
The skills practiced on the game are easy for a kindergartener, so this would be a preschool buy for sure.One cool thing is, as with other Leapfrog games, you can track progress online and set up some of the input variables to create appropriate test problems for the game.
Also, if you've had your leapfrog explorer or leap pad awhile, go online and they'll do an ""update"" tuneup that takes about 20 minutes but adds some great free features and micromods.
BTW, we've checked everywhere...Amazon has the cheapest prices on Leapster games of anywhere, you just have to check regularly, especially on""Today's Deals""."
My daughter is always peering over her brother's shoulder while he plays his Leap Pad.
There are so many fantastic games out there for his age group, and she struggles a bit with them at this point.
It is great to have a game designed for the 3-5 age range.
My daughter was thrilled to open this, immediately popped it into the Leap Pad, and became engrossed.
It's very easy for her to play, and she picked up on it within the first few minutes.There are several options for play, from more learning-geared projects to more simply fun projects.
Her favorite parts right now are designing the bows.
Minnie's friends are throwing her a surprise party to celebrate the success of her store, and they each call up and order bows.
A lot of the characters from Mickey's Club House are in the game, including Claribelle the Cow, Daisy and Cuckoo Loca, along with Minnie's nieces.
Four friends call up to order bows, and after designing all four, there is a surprise party for Minnie.
You can pick colors for the ribbon and add in up to 20 jewels to decorate.
You can even add a sparkle color for extra pizzazz.
Each time you successfully finish a bow, you get a new color/design added to the options for the next bow making session.You can also help Daisy decorate for the party by changing the wallpaper, hanging bows and changing the design of the chairs, music, cake, etc.For more learning-oriented games (rather than the just for fun ones), kids can match letters, sounds and colors to help complete tasks in Minnie's Bow-tique.Overall, it's a really cute game.
I think the age range recommended is just about right - I can't see it holding an older child's interest.
If your child is just getting started with games like this or the Leap Pad interface, I think this would be a perfect start.
I got this game for my daughter, who's in Kindergarten, and have mixed thoughts about it.
Minnie Mouse's friends are planning a surprise party for her, and you have to help them get ready by decorating the party room, dressing Daisy up in a special outfit, and making new bows for everyone to wear to the party.
The graphics and controls for this game are awesome!
The mini-games are very creativity-oriented and also teach colors, letters, and other ready-to-read skills.
What there is of this game is really fantastic.Unfortunately, though this is one of the cutest Leapster Explorer games I've seen, it's also one of the most minimal with regards to content.
The entire game can be played through in less than 20 minutes before it loops back to the beginning and repeats.
For the amount of content you get, it seems much more like a $10 app than a $25 cartridge game, and it just hasn't been enough to hold my daughter's attention the way our other Leapster Explorer games have.
If you have a 2 or 3 year-old who loves doing the same thing over and over again, it might not be bad, but for slightly older children, I think ourLeapFrog Explorer Learning Game: Disney TangledandLeapFrog Explorer Learning Game: Dora the Explorer (works with LeapPad & Leapster Explorer)games offer a lot, lot more playtime than this game for the same price and are much better alternatives.
Out of the many things that Santa bring on Xmas day, this was under the tree...She run to her room and play for at least two hours straight before look to the other toys... She is having a blast ith it.
My daughter is 4YO and are having such a great time with this
"My three-year-old munchkin is the one using the game.
She's a big Minnie fan, and a huge fan of all things ""Bow-Tique"", so this was right up her alley.She got quite a kick out of it for several hours -- making the bows, preparing for the party, etc.
-- but after that few hours, she got kind of bored with it and didn't come back to it for several days.
Since then it's been kind of on and off.But that seems to be simply how it is with munchkins.
They play with things, then move on to other things, then come back.So, for what it is, I think it's a good value.
I do have to mention that in this day and age of cell phone and tablet apps that do pretty much the same thing, and often cheaper (if not free), you may want to assess your needs before buying."
My daughter is 8 and isn't really into Minnie Mouse, so keep that in mind.
She liked the girly'ness of this game a lot but I found that she seemed to lose her interest fairly quickly.
It's a cute game though and a girl that's a bit younger (maybe around 4 and 5?)
that is into Minnie Mouse would enjoy this one much more!It does have some learning activities that I thought were fun.
But there's a lot they can do that isn't necessarily learning (though it kind of is, they just don't know it!)
and is pretty entertaining.
I found it worked well for car rides when there wasn't a tv or other games tempting them away and they needed something to do.
Surprisingly enough my 4 year old son seemed to enjoy the game too!
Minnie's Bow-tique uses early reading skills and fun characters and animation in LeapFrog's latest game release.In this game, Minnie is getting ready for a surprise party, and asks for your child's help in creating ribbons and bows for all of her friends.In order to collect ribbons and bows, your child must match colors, letters, and word sounds.Skills featured in this game are: blending sounds into words (Phonics concepts), upper and lower case letters, logic, reasoning (help dress Daisy for a party), listening skills, and colors.While this game works on both the LeapPad and Leapster Explorer systems, it is best played by younger children (PreK and K).
My Kindergarten child throughly enjoyed this game, but my older daughter, in third grade, quickly grew bored with it.If your child enjoys watching Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on Disney Junior on TV, or has seen the Minnie's Bow-tique special on DVD, then they will enjoy this game as well.
My kids love their LeapPad and this Minnie game is adorable!
It has just enough features to keep kids attention and is a great way for them to secretly practice their words, memory skills, colors and other preschool aspects.
My kids go back and forth to it, as they do all their games.
Its so cute how they use the different Minnie Mouse character and friends to teach kids.
While the stuff taught in the game is simple and food all over (smartphone games and apps, books and even other video games) you are paying for the Disney character too, which if you have a Minnie Mouse fan this would be perfect as a educational bonus!
Overall, this is a bright, colorful and very kid-friendly game that is perfect for any child preschool aged who loves Minnie Mouse and is looking for a fun way to learn!
I gave this game to my 5 & 7 year olds for Christmas and my 5 year old in particular likes playing the game.
My 7 year old easily looses interest mainly since it's easy and repetitive.
My 5 year old however loves making bows and decorating.
It's not much of an educational game for her age but I can see a 3 or 4 year old learning colors and fine motor skills from the game.
If you have a little girl that loves Mickey and Minnie, add this game to your collection.
"My three-year-old daughter loves her LeapPad.
She was very excited to get this Minnie Mouse Bowtique Surprise Party ""game"" for her LeapPad.
She has the Minnie Mouse Bowtique toy so she was familiar with Minnie's dress-up bows and such.The game held her attention for quite a while.
There are several things you can do to earn pretty new ribbons to make bows.
There are some fun little games that my daughter was able to play pretty well.
Then, all the characters go to a party sporting the beautiful bow and dresses you picked for them.
It is very girly, so little princesses will love it!"
"This is a cute game.
My 3 and 5 year old girls enjoy it.
It has great graphics and features two Disney characters that have been adored for generations, Minnie and Daisy.
The user can design bows in Minnie's bowtique and also play an assortment of games.
I was left wanting more educational content from the game since it is a ""learning game"" but my girls were entertained nonetheless.Like other LeapFrog products (ex.
Tag or Tag Jr.), it costs a decent amount of money to buy the device and even just a few books/games.
If your family already has a tablet, it may be more affordable to download a few games to entertain/teach your child.
But if you have the money to get your child their own tablet, this LeapPad system was definitely created for kids, with education in mind and seems to be very durable!"
My 5 year old loved the game at first but has lost interest.
There doesn't seem to be a whole lot to do.
"I have a 5 year old boy, so I was hesitant to get this in part due to the fact that I worried it would be too easy for him with the 3-5 year age range and also because it is obviously geared to girls.
I'll admit, he has an older sister so ""girl toys"" have never been an issue and has games like Tangled and Brave for his LeapPad too.
When he saw the game, he couldn't wait to play it.
He has played it for hours on end.
He's making his way through it fairly quickly, but I expected that.
What's most important is that he's really enjoying the game.
I like that instead of playing Skylanders, he's learning things like letters, using logic to work through puzzles, and word sounds playing his game.
He also enjoys collecting the bows as he completes them and comes to show me every now and then how many he has done and how many are left."
Yes, this is a girly game, however, due to my nieces, my son does not care or see it that way.
He was ecstatic to try this game out after seeing the girls play!
The Bowtique is a fun because it is interactive.
I like that so that he is not just watching something, he is making the things happen.
One thing I especially liked was that they give directions verbally so that although my son does not read yet, he could understand what to do.
The concept of the game is that Minnie's friends are throwing her a surprise party and all of the friends call to have Minnie make a bow for a special day.
Kids can make bows with Minnie (where they can be their own artist!
), decorate with Daisy, play matching games, practice colors and following directions by choosing Daisy's clothes, etc.
I am always impressed with leap frog and I think any kid would enjoy this game.
The first thing I noticed playing this game with my 2 3/4 year old is that the graphics are a notch up from our other LeapFrog games.
The characters all look great and the environments are colorful and packed with little details.
The animation's are fairly simple, but fit well with the style of the game.
More importantly, this game is a lot of fun.
My little girl played for over 30 minutes on the first go.
She went back to another game the next day, but only for a little while and has been playing Minnie's Bow-tique ever since.
While I think it's the perfect game for a 3 or even 4 year old girl, I think some 5 year olds may get bored by the simple game mechanics.My daughter loves showing me the bows she creates and there is some flexibility to make attractive designs with different fabrics, paints and jewels.
The game include a party room to view characters wearing your bows (and interact by touching them and objects around the room).
There is also a decent amount of narrative throughout the game where characters will call your shop to order bows, Daisy and Minnie will chat with each other, etc.
There are not a ton of different things to do in this game, but the games that are there are well-suited to most 3-4 year olds, entertaining and fairly educational.
"This game takes place in Minnie's Bow-Tique.
She makes bows for customers while Daisy is planning a surprise party for Minnie.
There are several games within this game that your child can play.
As a parent, the game seems a easy and slow paced, but it is meant for ages 3-5.
My 4 year daughter loves all things Minnie, so she really enjoys this game.
It is not a difficult game for her at all, and she just enjoys paying the various games.
There are only a few ""skill"" which are learned in this game; color matching and identification, and hearing the sound of a word and finding the picture that goes with it, and tracing lines.
Not one of the most educational games as compared to other Leappad games my children own, but it's a fun game that my daughter likes to play."
This is a good but not great game for a toddler.
Some of the games that involve hand eye coordination can keep them busy for a while.
But the ones that are more Q&A and/or design will get old fast.
I reviewed the LeapPad 2 version, and I have to say the LeapPad 2 is a fantastic device: download an art program and keep your child occupied for a good long stretch; add another game that better challenges their tablet swipe motions, and your golden for, dare I say, a car trip.
This particular game, however, is only good... not great.
My great grandaughter is a little girlie girl and she loves this game.
She started playing the little bow game and was so fast at it I couldn't keep up with her
My almost 5-year old was very eager to try this game - she loves Minnie Mouse and loves fashion so this game was right up her alley.
There are multiple games to play including Ribbon Roundup, Butterfly Bows, and Daisy's Dressing Room - all to help plan a surprise party for Minnie Mouse.
I love that the difficulty level adjusts as your child plays the game, and is helping my daughter learn logic and memory skills, words sounds and letter recognition, reasoning and colors - all while she's having fun.This game cartridge works with both the LeapFrog Leapster Explorer or Tablet devices, and is appropriate for ages 3-5 years although I think somebody right at the 3-year range might need a little help with a few things in the game, and even a 6 or 7 year old might enjoy playing this as well.
I do like the fact that the game explains what to do throughout, which helps my daughter who can't read much yet.
This game was designed really well - any little budding fashionista will enjoy it.
This game is great, I have played it and watched my children play it and it wins all around.
There is a story to this game, Daisy Duck is throwing a surprise party for Minnie in the bow shop, you work in the shop to help both Daisy get ready for the party and Minnie do her work in the shop.
There are many fun mini-games to play and they are easy enough for my three year old to handle.
There is a matching game to find the same color ribbon spools, a game that has you pick the picture to match the word you hear (on flying bows) and more.
The best part for my kids was the ability to design bows of their own for the characters to wear.
This game is lots of fun and has plenty of re-play value!
This is designed for ages 3 to 5, which I believe to be very age appropriate, although my daughter at age 6 still enjoys playing this game.
It is a game where they are planing a surprise party for Minnie.
Everyone needs bows for the party, and while keeping it a secret, they order and your child helps make the bows.
It is a very simple game to play.
It is a lot of fun for any child that enjoys Minnie's Boutique.
We got my soon-to-be-3yo a Leappad for Christmas and the Minnie's Bow-tique game to sate her love of all things Minnie.
The game is pretty simple: you pick sparkels, stars, etc, and rub them on an on-screen ribbon for about a minute.
Then pull it into a bow (this took a few times for her to understand), and voila!
And repeat.
And repeat.
And repeat.
Without much complexity or variance, it's unlikely to hold the attention of older children, but it's prefect for the early-preschool crowd who adore earning the praise of their favorite Disney character.
Leapfrog must have some really good design folks.
They keep coming up with games that kids love to play that teach them in a way they absolutely love.
This is another good game for getting little ones hooked on reading and enjoying the learning.
If your young one loves Minnie then she will certainly love this game.
A Wonderful learning game for your Leappad, Leappad 2 or Leapster Explorer systems.
The Disney Minnie's Bow-tique Super Surprise Party teaches Word Sounds, Letter Recognition, Memory Skills & Logic & Reasoning.
It Contains 4 different games with different levels of difficulty which automatically adjust to your child's learning as they progress.
The Minnie's Bow-tique Super Surprise Party is recommended for ages 3-5 or Pre-K to Kindergarten children and mainly feature Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck.
My 5 year old daughter loves this and it is a great introduction to pre-reading and overall development.
A Great addition to any Leapfrog game collection.
My daughter loves this game!
There are decent skills learned and she enjoys that it is Minnie, of course.
Between this one and Phineas and Ferb, she pretty much does not play any others.
No matter how much a child can learn from a game, they learn nothing if they don't play because it is not fun!
"My daughter, at 4.5 years has pretty much aged out of this game.
She still finds some enjoyment in in, but it's a pretty limited game.
It has several different sections in the ""game"" (if you can really call it that).
Mostly the game teaches colors and some letter recognition, it just isn't very deep and is definitely very basic and not-complex.
Not that everything has to be complex, but I was expecting a little more gameplay.For smaller kids new to the Leapfrog system, this is a pretty good buy.
If your child is 4.5-5 years or older, this game is probably geared too young for them."
The setting of this game is Minnie's Bow-tique, where she designs and sells bows.
The characters are illustrated as they appear on Disney Channel's Disney Junior's _Minnie's Bow Toons_, having a faux 3D look to them.
The graphics are cute pastels, highly feminine with bows and hearts abounding!In the game, Minnie is taking phone call orders from her friends for bows--you have to tap the phone to answer it.
The main activity is creating hair bows for animals who call.
The hair bow color is chosen, the ribbon snipped, and then it's looped and tied (with some simple swipes on the screen) and then decorated with sequins (gems) in bowls--later, glitter is an earned addition.
More ribbon designs are also earned as play progresses.
There's no real right or wrong in this game--it's about creativity.
Once all the orders (four) are fulfilled, it's time for Daisy's party.
Minnie also has a ribbon activity for matching things (like colors and patterns), that can be done at any time.
This matching game is done face-up (i.e., not a memory-type game).Meanwhile, Daisy is planning Minnie's surprise party.
Scrolling the main screen, the player can visit her activities.
One is called Daisy's Dress-Up.
This activity helps with color recognition, since she wants to wear a certain color outfit.
After choosing colored outfits, the game allows the user to pick any outfit.
In Daisy's game Butterfly Bows, a man sounds out a word, and the appropriate bow--with that word pictured on it--must be dragged into a box.
After this is played for a while, there's a fun speed-related, non-educational activity.If the party room is gone into before Minnie has made all of her bows, the user and Daisy can redecorate the room, changing things like furniture, the wallpaper, or decorating it with stickers, including earned ones.
The first thing that struck me about this game was the high quality graphics and voice.
They look and sound pretty very much like the characters on Mickey's clubhouse on Disney Jr. We tried the game on the Leapster GS and the LeapPad 2 and it worked on both, but definitely has an edge on the higher quality screen of the LeapPad2.So, game play... the primary game both my kids (2 year old and 5 year old) play seems to be a bow tying and decorating game.
They seem to enjoy it, but I had to turn it on myself and play it a bit to uncover more educational skills in it.
It does have color matching and a bit of letter sounding in it.
Their fine motor skills should develop from using the stylus which I hope will translate into hand writing skills.
There is also some educational value in them listening to the directions and following them.
Certainly more than just sitting around and watching Disney Jr.
However, I wish they it incorporated some other skills like doing a little guided counting or addition.I think the gameplay would be better if they added a bit more to it, but then again keeping it simple and fun while is importan.
Whatever the case, it is a very nice looking game that the kids seem to enjoy for short periods of time and they have gone back to it several times.
"This game provides great ""learning entertainment"" for younger kids.
Work with familiar characters from the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse to get ready for a Surprise Party.Kids will work with patterns, colors, sounds, letters, and numbers to get ready for s Surprise Party.
This is made especially fun if your kids ever watch the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and have seen some of the Minnie's Bowtique episodes.The game does provide repetitive learning fun for young kids.
It will be very short entertainment for older kids, who might like to run though the game a few times total.
I find that my younger child likes to ""know"" what is coming up, so enjoys the repetitiveness.In all, another great addition to our Leap Frog Explorer library."
