Top sentence(s):
My older daughter received the regular Spot It game for her 7th Birthday and we already knew we loved the concept.
The main game has the players (at least two and up to as many as can fit around the cards) flipping two cards over at the same time and then trying to find the one animal that has a match.
Spot it Jr. is fun for all ages.
Such a simple concept but the excitement is finding things first.
Of course, adults can't play at full speed here (memory games are where the kids beat the adults!

Questions:
What age groups?
Is it too easy for a 4 year old who already is good at identifying and picking similar things out: similar to the spot it books?
Suitable for a 4 yr old?
Can I put together 2 sets of these cards to prolong the game? My concern is that I'll end up with duplicated cards. Will the game be less fun?
How many can play at a time?
What age range is this for?My granddaughter is 2.
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
This is a fantastic game!
I was first introduced to this by my daughter who played it with a friend, told me how fun it was, and of course, asked for it.
Soon after, I played the regular Spot it!
game with some adult friends, and we all thought it was a fun game of speed.So now we have Spot it Jr!, and it's perfect for our family because everyone can play.
The Jr. version just has animal pictures of various sizes.
You look for matching animals in two different cards and try to be the fastest to find them.
You can see examples of the cards and pictures in the photos above.Seriously, a fun game for all ages!
"We have been playing this game with our four year-old since it arrived and he loves it!
(We love it too, by the way).
When I say ""it"" I mean all five game variations included in the instructions.
What a great idea to offer different options on how to play.
If more game manufacturers did that, it would be a win for both consumers and producers as there is much more replayability.As a side note, how in world did they ensure that every card will have one and only one match with every other card in the deck?"
I have a 12-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter.
Finding games that both can play together, and that both will enjoy, can often be a challenge.
Surprisingly, this game has become one that both have fun playing together.The game itself poses the challenge of finding matches.
As the game says, there is only one animal match between any two cards.
The main game has the players (at least two and up to as many as can fit around the cards) flipping two cards over at the same time and then trying to find the one animal that has a match.
There are several variations upon this main game, but the basic premise remains the same.The great thing about this particular game is that the younger players are not necessarily at a disadvantage with the older ones.
It's all about observations and patterns - something younger ones often excel at.It's an excellent game to give as a gift, for road trips, stocking stuffers, or even for classrooms.
We have 4 year old, 6 year old, and 9 year old kids.
This game is easy enough for the 4 year old to understand but too easy for the older ones.
Each game is different so that is nice.In my opinion, skip Jr and just by the original Spot It even if you have a preschooler.
Our four-year-old son is really not one to sit and play games, which has pretty much killed off our old &#34;Family game night&#34; tradition.
We thought this might be a good fit for him, and it seems to have done the trick...he loves &#34;matching&#34;, as he calls it, and the game is actually fun enough to get the whole family drawn in.
I've never played the adult version of Spot It, so I can't say if this is similar or not,  but the kid version has lots of recognizable animals for younger players, and it's been a great tool in teaching our son to recognize patterns, and the cards are durable enough to stand up to younger players.
Our family loves the original Spot it game and were excited to try the jr. version with our 4 and 2 year old.
These cards include only animals and fewer objects per card to simplify the game for the younger crowd and yet we, as adults, were not bored to play with them-in fact our four year old has beaten us many a time!
It amazes us every time that between any two of the 31 cards there is always one match.
We would highly recommend this game.
We have a preschooler and a first grader and this is one of the few games we can all play together.
I love watching my first grader get faster and faster as we play, he's so excited when he finds the match before we do.
Our preschooler loves the game and is pretty good at it, but can't keep up with the rest of us.
However we found the perfect solution; we have her be a team with her brother!
I can play without holding back and the two of them are a totally even match for me.
And the best part, because they win or lose together they don't fight and argue.
They actually love Spot It Jr. so much I have to hide it from them when I don't have time to play.One additional thought, my kids do like to play with the cards and there is risk of one or more getting lost or damaged.
But with this game that is no problem at all, you can play just as well with a few cards missing as with the whole set, it makes no difference.
I LOVE a game that doesn't get ruined if you lose a piece.
5 stars!------------------------------------------------------We have enjoyed Spot It Jr. so much that we have since purchasedSpot ItandSpot it!
Halloween Card Game.
We are Spot It fools.
Excellent games!
This is a Jr. version of the popular Spot it!
game.
The game cards have 6 different animal images - very nicely printed and look cute.
There 5 different games suggested in the manual.
The different games require you to find the matching animal between two different cards.
There are Each animal image is present only on two different cards.
So for a given animal, there is only one possible pair of matching cards.We tried the game with a set of kids aged 4,5,7 and 10.
The actual rules ask for all kids to play at the same time for example to find if there is a matching animal between two cards.
Whoever finds it first wins the round.
The problem is that older kids always find it quicker than the younger ones who get frustrated after a while.
If you manage to get a set of kids all same/very close ages, then it's fine.
When playing as family or with our set of kids, We modified the rules so that each kid get their turn and take their time to find if there are matching animals between two cards.
This set has 31 cards in total and the game can get old pretty quickly.
Overall, it's a really good game that helps make kids smart - quick response and comparison.
I teach pre K and it is important to find different ways to develop the eye hand coordination.
This game is social, fun and can be played as a group activity where they work together to find the items on the cards.
We enjoy the art work and that they are not only look for the item they also have to look for size as it changes.
When we can make learning a game it is always the best way to go in the classroom.
I also love the tin the cards are kept in.
Not big and doesn't take up room but does keep the cards clean and safe until the next time.
Big hit with 5 year olds.
My whole family loves the originalSpot It.
If you haven't played, the idea is simple.
You get a round tin full of circular cards.
Each card has a bunch of different symbols on it.
Between any 2 cards, there will always be 1 matching symbol.
You have to be the first to identify the matching symbol and call it out.
Off of that simple start, there are countless variations (be the first to get rid of your cards, get the most cards from the pile, or make up your own).
The rules are simple, the game is fast, and even my kids can beat me on a good day.So why Spot It Jr?
Original Spot-It has 8 symbols per card, whereas Junior has 6.
The original Spot-It has 55 cards whereas Junior has 31.
Having fewer symbols on each card makes it a bit easier for younger kids to play.
Also, the Original Spot-It has some funky symbols, like a maple leaf, anchor, cactus, knight.
Younger kids will likely be more comfortable with the animals on Spot It Junior - a pig, octopus, cat, dog, deal, shark, bat, etc.Whichever you play, the kids will love it.
My 4 year old played Spot It (the original) just fine and liked it, and he also likes the more colorful cards and fun animals on Spot It Jr.
Both are great games.
I'm not much for games, so it's tough sometimes when the kids want to play.
Spot It is one of the few games I actually enjoy, and they love it too, so it's a win-win for everyone.
It is quick and easy to play, there are variations for shorter and longer games to keep it interesting, and it's a lot of fun.
We have the original Spot It as well, which we enjoy, but it's a little tougher for the kids.
This one gives them a better chance of winning, which of course, they love.
:)  This is a great one for taking on vacation or over to someone's house--easy to transport and cleanup, doesn't have a ton of little pieces that might get lost.
Great game!
So there are seemingly infinite permutations of this game coming out.
I can't imagine why you would need more than one set, but I highly recommend owning a set.
Kids really enjoy playing it, it builds skills, and it's small and portable.
Great to throw in the purse or trip bag.
The junior version says 4 and up, but 3 year olds can easily play it.
What makes the Junior Animals version appealing for preschoolers is that they will recognize all the images easily.
That said, I prefer the original game.
If you're playing competitively, then you might need the juniors set to even the playing field, but if the 3 year old's play partner is willing to cut some slack, why not give them a little extra time on the harder set of cards?
More of a challenge and a skill builder that way.
Plus you can have interesting conversations about the images or words the child doesn't know.
"My kids, particularly my seven-year-old, enjoy Spot It Junior.
The game is comprised of round cards, each of which has several objects pictured on it.
The idea is that players lay out the cards as they play against each other and try to be the first to spot a match between objects.
The trick is that every pair of cards has a different combination of objects and only one match between any two cards (with all cards having a one item match between them).
The logistics that someone had to deal with in figuring out the combinations is a little mind-boggling, but it's also quite fun for kids.
My daughter enjoyed playing alone as well as with the family.
On her own, it simply became a game of matching and observation.
I can't say that this is a particularly exciting game for adults, but it is one that is great for kids and adults to play together.
I've learned that my kids are much more observant than I give them credit for, and this game is so much more fun than the tired old ""classics"" like Candyland or Chutes and Ladders which never cease to bore me!"
"Don't be fooled by it's simplicity and colorful design.
Spot it Jr!
is not just a fun game, it builds visual perception and cognitive processing as players locate matching animals on the individual cards.
My kids (ages 6 and 8) and I (middle-aged Mom) played all of the games for this review and found the games just challenging enough so that no one player dominated.
It built their visual perception skills (which are good for reading and math) while it exercised my cognitive speed (I'm not getting any younger).There are 5 different mini games that take just minutes to play.
My kids liked the ""Twins"" game where all players have to find the match between 2 cards (winner take all).
I liked the ""Tower"" and the ""Well"" where we all had different cards to match with the center card.We thought that this game was best for ages 4-9 (two of the games are better for ages 6 and up).
However, the best feature was that the whole family could play.
The cards appear to be fairly durable and the set is small enough to fit into a large purse or travel bag.
Despite what the description says, this is not a good game for quiet spaces (restaurant, waiting room) unless your kids' voices are fairly quiet."
My four year-old and my six year-old both really love this game, although they can't really compete against each other.
On the surface, it seems like it would be too easy, but the different sizes of the animals really adds a challenge, even sometimes for adults.
For older children, the challenge comes in the speed, rather than just seeing if you can find the match.
Also, perhaps a minor detail, but I love the durable tin it comes in.
We have way too many card games that came packaged in cardboard boxes that are falling apart at the seams.
"I've used this with 3-4 year olds in speech therapy and for the most part, they've loved it.
It's very easy to spot the animals and matches.
Durable cards that could be spot washed if needed.
The tin is sturdy and really handy to slip in your bag or even pocket.
You can adapt the cards by naming the animals, using the concept ""big and small, fast and slow..."" For some of the older kids however, they were bored by about the 5th time 'spotting' and wanted to move on.
I would also use this in the car because it is a snap to clean up.
Would make a great stocking stuffer this Christmas."
"We are always on the lookout at my house for a game that we can all play as a family.
Having a mix of readers and not readers, large attention spans and short ones makes this a huge challenge.
This game wins!!!
It's easy to explain, easy to learn, and fast to play.
If someone gets distracted for a few turns it's not big deal to the rest of the players because it's easy to ""skip"" them and have them join back in later.
The cards are colorful and the tin makes it an easy game to put in a bag and play almost anywhere (air planes, lobbies, restaurants,  dr offices...)  It great for observation, and levels the field in terms of not having to read but still being fun and fast for all ages.
Great game!"
There are few games that are truly enjoyable for the whole family and various age ranges and abilities, while not terribly boring for the adults.
This is one of those gems that fits the bill.It's easy enough for younger ones (or in my case, students with disabilities) to spot matching animals on the cards.
There are variations to keep it simple or make it more challenging, and the cards are all cute and colorful to look at.Card size is about 4 inches around and they fit in a fabulous little tin for easy storage or to bring along in a bag for a quick something to kill time while waiting with bored little ones.Terrific little game!
Our family loved playing this game.
We had a 60 yr old, two adults who are thirty years old, someone in their twenties and three kids ages 3,5 and 7 play Spot It.
We had a a blast.
This is a great family game and we know that we will be playing this for years to come.
Such a simple concept but the excitement is finding things first.
That is why the entire family can play this game together.
The 3 year old even shocked us several times when he found the item first.
lol  For the cost of this game you cannot go wrong.
The fact that anyone of any age can play makes this a great family game!
My older daughter received the regular Spot It game for her 7th Birthday and we already knew we loved the concept.
This is even better for my younger daughters because the pictures are more recognizable so my 4yr old can play along at a fair pace.
Plus, what child doesn't love adorable animals?!
?The game is so simple but loads of fun!
It's one that never seems to get old and one everyone enjoys, even adults.
But, it's great that my girls can play this game without adult help too.To top it off, I love the tin case.
It is a tad tricky to open (keeps my toddler from making a mess of the cards).
But, I like that I can throw it in my purse and the kids can play in the car (they sit next to eachother), at a restaurant while we wait for food, or in waiting rooms.Simple fun that makes a great gift for many ages!
:)
What I love most about this game isn't really the game itself, but the great container it comes in...it slips easily into my purse and goes everywhere we do, so when the kids are stuck with me at the Cafe on a Saturday morning as I socialize, they have something they can do together that is easy and great fun.
Easy and entertaining for the little ones....a great game for the whole family, and easily transported to share the wealth with other friends!
Highly recommended!
Spot It Junior has the same idea/concept as the original Spot It game, but it's made a little simpler for younger kids to enjoy.
Like the original Spot It game, the Junior version has cards with multiple pictures, and there is one matching picture between any two cards that you need to 'spot.'
The Junior version of the game has fewer pictures per card, and the pictures are all friendly/cute looking animals - making it easier for younger kids to play along.The manufacturer's recommended age for the Junior game is 4-15, my 5 & 1/2 year old had fun with this but got bored with it quickly, it was a little too easy for her.
She had no trouble playing and enjoying the regular version of Spot It.Whether you're playing the original or Junior version the game is still fun and perfect for travel with kids - highly recommended!
I can't say I expect the game to last for years, because the cards are still basically coated cardboard.I do love the portability, the storage can and the absence of a zillion little game pieces.I like the quick set up and quick clean up.I like that my 3, 5 and 7 year old all enjoy playing it.
Though, it's obviously more challenging to the younger one.Naturally, the kids like that it's an animal theme rather than just shapes or numbers.It's a convenient little toy to carry in a purse if you need to keep a little one entertained in public places, like doctors offices and restaurants.When the cards do eventually fall apart, it's not expensive to replace.
I was surprised at how fun this game is and how well it works across different ages.
I find that adults do not always have an advantage in pattern recognition when competing against kids (and kids love that).
This version of Spot It has a lower age range and the pictures are a little bit easier to recognize.
Some 4 and 5 year olds do just fine with the regular version of Spot It, so don't think you have to follow the age guide.
We especially like these games because we can throw them quickly into a bag when headed out the door.
You could easily stash one in your glovebox as an emergency kit for bored kids.
This version of &#34;Spot It&#34; is great!
The card game is portable and a game for ALL ages!
From 3 - 103, all can play this simple and easy to learn game without having to read or have complicated rules/directions.
The tin is ADORABLE and the only reason the game is getting 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish the cards were a bit heavier.
They are somewhat flimsy and I was disappointed in the quality of the cards themselves.
Other than that, this card game would made a great stocking stuffer!
We love family game night at my house, but my 3 and 4 year old normally can't participate because of the games the older kids choose.
Spot it Jr. is fun for all ages.
You can make it more complicated for the older kids and easier for the younger kids.
My kids ask to play Spot it whenever we have game night now.
Spot It Junior Animals is a clever game that can include the entire family (up to 6 people).
Every card has six animals, and only one of those animals will match any other card.
The first player to spot where their card matches the house card wins that round.
The rules are easy.
The cards are round, with a surface area similar to a deck of standard playing cards.
This review is only my observation, not that of my children, who were confused by the lack of a single mode of gameplay and eschewed the game.I thought the flexibility of gameplay options was great.
I also like that the game is suitable for pre-readers and is easily portable, a great item to put in your bag or even a pocket when going out for appointments or a meal in order to keep kids busy.
I also like that the idea of variants in gameplay would encourage players to invent not only their own variations here but also on other card or board games.This would be a great Hanukkah gift or stocking stuffer.
The only complaint I have is that the pictures are somewhat small for the farsighted among us but the small images allow more images per card while keeping the cards small enough to be held in small hands.
We own several versions of Spot It!
as well as similar games such as Jungle Speed and Blink.
We found that the regular version of Spot It was great to with kids 8 and up, but the 5 year old just couldn't compete.
Spot It Jr!
fills that gap.
Of course, adults can't play at full speed here (memory games are where the kids beat the adults!
), but the easier icons does make the game flow faster and easier for younger kids to play.
Definitely recommend.
One note of caution, however.
The cards are not super sturdy so wear and tear is a concern.
