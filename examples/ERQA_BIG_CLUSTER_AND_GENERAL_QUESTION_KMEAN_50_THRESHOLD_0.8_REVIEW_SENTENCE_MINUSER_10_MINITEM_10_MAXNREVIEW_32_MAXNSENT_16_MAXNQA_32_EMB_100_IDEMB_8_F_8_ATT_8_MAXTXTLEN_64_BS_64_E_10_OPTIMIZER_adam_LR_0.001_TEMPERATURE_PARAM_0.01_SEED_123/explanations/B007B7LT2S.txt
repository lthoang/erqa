Top sentence(s):
Why do I think that is where it will remain until we conduct our twice-a-year Salvation Army purge?I know that the Disney Princesses will appeal to may young children; therefore, this might be nice to pick-up for a holiday party, birthday party, etc.
in that case the player pretends to be the princess in question and the others guess who it is for a jewel.
my 5yo daughter loved this game!
The game ends when any player has their tiara, bracelet and ring filled with the sparkling gems.
Then you use the big red heart gem to decode the picture on the back of the card to confirm if your answer is correct, and see how many gems you get.

Reviews:
"My granddaughter was pretty sick when this board game arrived and she really wasn't patient enough to try to ""win"" the charms for her crown.
She had been in bed for several days and was still not feeling well at all.So the board game itself did not go over well.
BUT, her Mom and I put together a tiara for her and she walked proudly around the house as a princess.A part of the game - where you act like a specific princess - requires the participant to know details about the Disney characters, so keep that in mind if you purchase the game for a child."
If it says princess on the box my girls get excited.
They love to play dress up and this is a fun game for them.The game itself is pretty simplistic and I think designed so that there is virtually no challenge to it - just jewel winning.I am going to guess that this game is already taken apart and the jewelry is just in the dress-up box.
Without any real challenge to the game it is just reduced to more plastic for dress up.Though - again, for the couple times I watched my girls actually play the game they were excited and enjoyed it.
This is a cute game, but aimed at a very specific audience - Little girls who love Disney Princesses.
Like Trivia Pursuit, you are asked questions in turn.
All of the questions are princess themed and you win jewels for each correct answer.
The goal is to get enough jewels to fill your crown, bracelet and ring.
The answers on the back of the question cards require the magic secret decoder heart jewel to see the answers.
If your child isn't familiar with the Disney Princess movies, this game will be frustrating.
Also, because you have a limited number of question cards, the game does get old fairly quickly.
The replay value on this game is very limited, but the idea is cute.
Also, the jewelry is not super sturdy and there are a lot of tiny pieces to keep track of.
The Dazzling Princess Game is loads of fun for Disney princess lovers.
It would be exciting to pull out during a small party or sleepover.
The jewelry is plastic, but the beauty of it is the concept of the game and how the little sparkling jewels attach to the game.
At first I was thinking that the construction was a little sub-par for something Disney, but after thinking about it felt the game was rather ingenious.
For imaginative princess lovers from the ages of four on up.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:&#9788; 4 Tiaras&#9788; 4 Rings&#9788; 4 Bracelets&#9788; 1 Big Heart Jewel&#9788; 40 Jewels&#9788; 200 Cards (1 1/2&#34; x 2 1/4&#34;)&#9788; 1 Rules ManualHOW TO PLAY:&#9658; Object: Be the first player to fill up your tiara, bracelet, and ring with gems!&#9658; Set Up:1.
Each player takes a tiara, bracelet, and ring.2.
Remove any gems already on the jewelry.3.
Have the cards, Big Heart Jewel, gems, and Princess protrait (on the back of the rules) handy.The player with the next birthday goes first.Each player draws a card.
If it's a Secret Princess card, the player has to guess who it is either by saying the princess's name or pointing to her.
The Big Heart Jewel card reader (you will have to take it out from the tiara on the top of the other ones) that will &#34;decode&#34; the answer.
If the player is correct he or she will get the number of jewels show and can put them on their jewelry.There are some pretend scenarios, but princess lovers are sure to make up their own, including adding a few &#34;rules&#34; of their own.
The game ends when any player has their tiara, bracelet and ring filled with the sparkling gems.
Of course the winner gets the Big Heart Jewel Reader to put in the top of their tiara.PRINCESSES PLAYERS MAY WISH TO BE FAMILIAR WITH:~ Ariel~ Aurora,~ Belle~ Cinderella~ Jasmine~ Merida~ Pocahontas~ Rapunzel~ Snow White~ Tiana Mulan
"The inexpensive price-tag makes a bit more sense when you see this game in-person.
(In fact, when my shipment arrived, I was stunned at how little is really included.)
The ""jewelry"" is (sadly) disappointing.
If a child says that ""it's not very pretty,"" than you know it's not the best.
Moreover, while popping the pieces into place went okay (for us), getting them out was not so easy.
(If you have a nice manicure, you may want your significant-other to give you a hand ... don't be tempted into using a butter knife.
Let's just say that I found out ""the hard way"").As mentioned by another reviewer, the game is a bit too simplistic.
When we were done, it was shoved under a bed (without the usual, ""Can we play again?"").
Why do I think that is where it will remain until we conduct our twice-a-year Salvation Army purge?I know that the Disney Princesses will appeal to may young children; therefore, this might be nice to pick-up for a holiday party, birthday party, etc.
(Though do be careful with the small parts ... some degree of supervision is probably a good idea).
Buy this with relatively low expectations and then you will not be disappointed."
players draw a card, and look at the visual clue (e.g., gaston, glass slipper, fairy godmother, etc) to figure out which princess the clue belongs to.
the answer is on the back of the card, but can only be read using a red decoder jewel.
if the player guesses correctly she gets a jewel in her crown/bracelet/ring.
there's a charades component where a card gives a mystery princess.
in that case the player pretends to be the princess in question and the others guess who it is for a jewel.
my 5yo daughter loved this game!
My niece likes this board game, she enjoys playing it with her friend next door.A girl who likes princesses and board games should enjoy this!
This game is a cute concept, but has some major flaws in my opinion.
First, the whole game is centered around the assumption that the girls playing it have watched all of these Disney movies - mine have not - bummer.
Second, the game is fun for a girl that is 3-6 years old, yet the game states ages 4 to 15.
I do not know any girl over the age of 6, maybe 7, that would still be interested in this game.
It is cute for the younger girls, but too babyish for the older girls.
Third, there are a bajillion tiny little pieces.
Maybe tiny little pieces don't bother you, but we have younger children in the home and all of these tiny pieces mean that our 4 year old doesn't get to play her game unless all of the younger kids are sleeping.
A bit of a damper for the birthday girl.
In conclusion, this game is cute in concept, but in my opinion could have been done better.
"I was reluctant to get this game because of the many 3-star reviews, but my 4-year-old daughter absolutely loves the Disney Princesses right now, so I figured, what the heck.
If the game sucked, then at least she'd have some jewelry to play with.But when I sat down with my daughter and my wife to figure the game out, we actually had fun with it.
Especially when I (a thirty-some-year-old man) got up and acted out my ""surprise princess"" card.
Mostly though, you just get visual clues on a card, then guess which princess it goes with.
Such as a clamshell for Ariel, and a monkey for Jasmine.
It's easy enough for my daughter to grasp at her age.
Especially since the players can point at the princess on a printout rather than having to remember their names.I was surprised at how many cards my daughter got right.
She's seen most of the movies, so that was a big help, but regardless her memory is amazing--we parents don't always give our children enough credit!With each successful guess, the player is given one to three jewels to place in a ring, bracelet, or crown.
The first player to fill all three wins.
Thankfully for me there were no dresses to wear."
This is a really fun game for little girls who like princesses.
To play, you draw a card and guess which princess is on it.
If you think you got it right, you use the big red jewel to receive the answer.
If you do get it right, you use the same red jewel to see how many jewels you get for guessing it right.
There is also a pretend card.
If you get a pretend card,  you act out the princess on your card.
If someone guesses it right, both players get jewel.
To win the game, you have to get enough jewels to fill up your bracelet, tiara, and ring.
The game I'd a lot of fun to play with but it is recommended for younger kids and for girls.
Filling up the tiara and bracelet was also fun to do.
The only thing I don't like is that reading the card with the jewel is difficult.
The concept of the game is also fun too.
Overall this is a really fun princess game and I would recommend it to a friend with a little girl.
Three girls--7, 5, and 3--have had a lot of fun with this.
They played it as the board game for one whole day, when it was rainy outside.
They haven't used it that way much since, but they have been having a blast just using the dress up components and playing pretend together, and playing with the cards.
It's always good when you can use a toy for more than one form of play I guess.
"I found this to be a fun little Princess game; I thought it might simply be a Princess version of the Pretty, Pretty, Princess game.
However, though their are similarities, it's unique as well.
Every player gets crown, bracelet, and ring at the beginning and you play to win the jewels for them.Play is made by guessing the princess that matches a clue on the card.
Clues are age appropriate (ages 4+), but familiarity with the Disney Princess movies will be necessary.
To confirm a correct answer, you must hold the large crown jewel over the card to reveal the princess's image.
The revealed image is clear but not bold.
I don't think this would be suitable for little ones with any vision issues; they might find it frustrating, as they likely would not be able to see the image.
Parents should plan to play along and be the de-coder for them.Definitely a choking hazard for little ones!
(The ""jewels"" are attached and detached as part of the game; these loose pieces are temptingly shiny and very small.)
Also, the smallest ones may need some assistance popping jewels in and out.All-in-all, it's a sweet little game, that should stand up to repeated play by most little ones.
Should be supervised play for smallest ones due to small parts and the possible need of assistance."
The Dazzling Princess Board Game is really more of a card and role-playing game for two to four young ladies who enjoy playing princess.Players draw cards and answer questions about Disney princesses and when a Pretend Card comes up, the player acts out the particular princess so the others can guess who it is.
The goal is to win plastic jewels for the plastic tiara, bracelet and ring.
The correct answer is revealed by the decoder heart.
Princess dresses are optional.The younger princesses will enjoy this game but they can also just play with the jewelry, though it is not recommended for children who might try to swallow the pieces.
My little princess put on their Disney dresses to play this game.
the had a lot of fun Its like play dress up or having a tea party.
If you have a child that loves to pretend this is the game for them.
They can play this game for a couple of hours and not get board.
Even the boys thought it was a good game as well.
I give it five stars for pretend play and no batteries required.
"I rarely completely dis a product but I can not see any redeeming value in this.
I compared the product I received to the product description (several times).
Yes the product I'm reviewing is what is described on this page.
This ""game"" and game pieces are just awful.The ""decoder"" might work better for younger eyes but my 40+ years can not read the decoder cards (even with good light and readers).
The game pieces are cheap plastic and I would have done better at the dollar store.
There are much better games out there for counting and identification skills and much better games / toys for those girls like my granddaughter who love anything princess.The Tiaras and ""Jewels"" will end up in the dress up box but this is not a game that will have any lasting value."
My 5 year old was soooo looking forward to playing this game, and I was almost as eager to play it with her, but after playing it a few times we were both rather disappointed with it.
The concept of the game is simple - a little too simple - you have to guess what princess the picture on the card is associated with and you either say which princess it is, or point to the princess on the picture,or 'act' it out.
Then you use the big red heart gem to decode the picture on the back of the card to confirm if your answer is correct, and see how many gems you get.
That's it.
You get gems for your correct guess, and use the gems to fill your ring, bracelet or tiara.
The gems are cheesy plastic pieces that are very difficult to get into the tiaras - my husband had to put them in the tiara and even I had a very hard time getting some of them out afterwards.
There is very little challenge to this game at all and I think most kids will be quickly disappointed.
What little appeal there is, is in being able to decorate the tiara and other accessories with the gems.Overall review - don't waste your money - there are much better games out there!
My daughter likes to play this one with her friends.
In fact we invited over a few just to try it out.
The box says ages 4 and up but we had ages 7, 8 and 9 paying it having a blast.My biggest concern is keeping all the little pieces together over time, but for now it holds up just fine.
Overall its a pretty cute game involving imagination,  puzzle solving, and play acting.
Perfect game for any little princess.
My daughter enjoys playing the game.
It is fairly easy for her to play, and she has fun.
But she also enjoys simply wearing the Tiara, bracelet, and ring and being a princess.So if your daughter loves being a princess, she will enjoy this game.
"Like the old Marty Robbins' song, ""A White Sportcoat and a Pink Carnation,"" this game will have every six-year-old ""all dressed up for the dance.""
My twin six-year-old girls love everyting Disney Princess, they love board games and they love dress up.
So here's a little item that features all three.
Theyr'e in heaven.
'Nuff said."
I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter, who loves the Disney princesses.
She was very excited to play this game when we first received it, but after playing a couple of times, she quickly lost interest.
The game is very simple and after playing once, it is a little too easy to win.
She still likes playing with the plastic jewelry, but isn't interested in playing the actual game anymore.
We played this game with two 8 year olds and one 11 year old.
They found it interesting and fun for about 20 minutes, then they didn't want to play anymore.
The box says it's good for ages 4 and up, and I think it is more appropriate for younger kids.
The game was not challenging enough my girls, and they felt too silly when they had to act out the part of the princess.
The pieces to the game were a little on the flimsy side and I don't think they would last a long time if they were played with often.
The hidden pictures were hard to find on some of the cards and we had to use a bright light.
I struggled with the star rating because it wasn't a hit with my girls, but I do think that it would be fun for 4 and 5 year olds, as long as an adult was playing with them to guide them through it.
This game is a hit with the little princesses.
It's probably every little girl dream to be a princess and the closest thing that one can be is to dress up and pretend to be one in this Dazzling Princess Game.While the accessories of this game is a bit cheap looking with the plastic tiara, rings, bracelets and gems, my niece and her little friends were all over the game as they just wanted to put on the tiara and be a princess.The game requires the 'princess' to guess which card matches the princess, or allows the 'princess' to act out the character and if guessed correctly, both the 'princesses' earn jewels - number of jewels to be decoded with a gem, to attach to their accessories.Whichever 'princess' that fills their accessories first is the winner.In my case, all the little girls were winners and princesses as they had fun!
