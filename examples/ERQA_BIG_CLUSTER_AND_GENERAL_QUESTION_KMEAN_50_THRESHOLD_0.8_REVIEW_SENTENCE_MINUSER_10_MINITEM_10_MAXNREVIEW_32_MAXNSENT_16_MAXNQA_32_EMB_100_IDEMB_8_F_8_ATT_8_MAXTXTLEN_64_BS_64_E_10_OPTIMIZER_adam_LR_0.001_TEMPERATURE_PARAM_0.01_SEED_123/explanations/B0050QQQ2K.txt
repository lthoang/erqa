Reviews:
These two little twins are so very cute!
They come in a super cute package, are made of soft plastic that can be washed for tons of outdoor fun and tea parties with real food so you don't have to worry about mess or ruining the doll themselves.
As anyone with small kids will know, clean is not an option so anything that can be easily cleaned with a wet wipe gets a gold star in my book! '
The twins come with their own personalities and their removable outfits that show off their own style.
You also have the ability to go online, with parental supervision, with the codes to enter a whole world of fun.This was the perfect gift for young sisters ages 6 & 7, for they each get their own doll and can play together for twice the fun.
Buy one gift for two girls?
Now that is what I call the perfect gift!
The only problem I had was the argument of which girl got which doll, which was easily fixed with after they read about their personalities and picked the doll that fit what they felt resembled them the most.Now my only problem is they want to get tons more outfits, but that is a small price to pay for the hours of fun they have been having with their twins.
Outside of being shocked by the size (I expected them to be bigger), these dolls are pretty great.
My daughters love them (and thank God there are two of them, even though it hasn't completely put an end to the fighting) and they are pretty cute little things (smaller than a Subway 6-inch).
I love that they are diverse babies, one being an angelic dancer and the other being a stylish punk-rocker, yet they are both similarly adorable (yes, they are twins).
The outfits are made well and fit nice, and the accessories (the crown and pacifier) are sturdy and actually fit on the dolls (I hate it when crowns refuse to stay on the dolls head).
I don't understand why the product features say that there are `oodles of accessories'; there are only two.
The charms are cute, even if the clip is flimsy.
The only real complaint is the cribs, which are pretty cheap.
They are made of a thin plastic material, but the babies actually fit inside so they are usable.
The only problem is that kids this young aren't usually careful with things, and so I have to take them away from my youngest, which means that my eldest can only play with the cribs if her sister is napping or not in the room.
Alas, the real `toy' here is the doll, and with their large heads and beaming eyes with those tinny-tiny bodies (that sit rather effortlessly in the crawling position), they are perfect companions for my perfect princesses!And yes, there is a whole world online (although I wouldn't say it was THAT extensive) that includes songs and games and videos and pictures.
Just enter the code and unlock your babies and your daughter (or granddaughter) can have lots of fun.
I wouldn't say hours' worth, but I'm sure they'll thoroughly enjoy watching the videos and playing the games, and it will surely make them want to buy more babies to unlock more characters on the website.Fun, fun, fun.Oh, and personally, I don't see a big issue with the price.
A singular doll is going to cost around $16 anyways, so getting two for $25 is actually a deal.
"Sarina and Sydney Cutie are the two dolls you will find in this Twins Criblife package.
The dolls come with outfits, a small booklet with quiz questions to determine which doll you are most like, a set of two charms on one chain with one code that unlocks two web dolls on the criblife.com web site, a pacifier, a princess crown and two cardboard ""cribs.
""The dolls are suggested for ages 5+, but I am not sure what the play scenarios are for these dolls.
They are direct opposites in terms of colors and styling.The Sarina doll is a ballerina princess.
She has a pink tutu, a pink plastic crown, tights and a shirt.
Her hair is blonde.
The crown accessory did not stay on very well and I had to tape it on for my daughter to use and not get frustrated with.The Sydney doll is a rock star type.
Her clothes have a skull and crossbones wearing a lipstick mouth and heart.
The pacifier has the crossbones with a heart in the middle of it.
I did not like this doll at all.
I thought her clothing, tinted pink hair and makeup on the skull were all inappropriate for this age group.The cribs are plastic-coated cardboard.
The dolls cannot lie down in them, only sit up.
The Sarina crib is white with princess shaping.
The Sydney crib has a city skyline and is black.The web site does not require a parental e-mail address or notify parents that their child has logged in.
They create their own login identity using two drop-down menus of names and a random number.
They create their own password.
My daughter is 4 and has many, many dolls.
Too many.
These however are different from all the other ones she owns.
The heads are bigger in proportion to their bodies but the clothes are very cute.
There is a jolly roger on one and they have big fluffed out skirts/tutus, and headbands.
Unfortunately she cannot use all the doll clothes she already owns on these because their bodies are smaller but she doesn't mind.
These have adorable accessories.
I think my daughters favorite part is the mini cribs they come with.
She loves putting them in their cribs and storing them there.
I think this is a wonderful birthday or christmas presents for girls 4, 5, 6 and 7 years old.
Big heads on little bodies...gave them to a niece who absolutely loved them.
Kisses and hugs for ol' uncle Jim !
Oh boy!The thing that impressed me the most , was the apparent durability .
It seems like the dolls will outlast my niece's desire to play with them !A great value for the $$$$$$$$$$
"First the good stuff ... the dolls included in this package are very cute and durable.
The clothes are good quality and our daughters like to pretend that the babies are crawling around on hands and knees.
That's about all you can do with this toy, play make-believe.And that's it for the good stuff.Now on to the bad stuff ... the cribs that are included are very cheap plastic, almost cardboard-like and the babies can't even fit in them ""comfortably"".
The product has little educational value, aside from the above-mentioned make-believe.
The first interaction with the product is the packaging, and this packaging is utterly horrible - the complete opposite of Amazon's great ""frustration-free packaging"" on other products."
"So much of the fun of toys depends on how they inspire the imagination of the children.
My granddaughter loves to play babies, and these two are just the cutest little dolls you've seen.
They come with cribs, which some reviews complained about, but no toys are made of long lasting materials anymore.
They are fine for play unless you have a child who loves to smash things.
My granddaughter is four, and she spent two hours playing with this one set.
So to me, that's the best review.
It's also a toy she comes back to, and the one thing she chooses to put in her backpack to take on outings.
I asked her what I should write about it, and she said ""Tell them they are good babies to get for their little girl.""
There you have it."
These twin dolls are extremely cute.
The cribs themselves are kind of flimsy, but the dolls and outfits are a huge hit with all 3 f my kids.
Each doll is adorable with big heads, little bodies, and large painted eyes.
The babies are visually appealing to the children.
The outfits are colorful and fun.
My daugthers (ages 6 and 5) can easily dress and undress them by themselves.
My toddler also likes the dolls and she grabs them whenever she sees them.
They are sized well for little hands.
There are a few small accessories, of course, but these dolls are really popular for both my toddler and my school aged children.
"I must confess that these dolls leave me very confused.
I bought these for a five year old who LOVES her Baby Alive dolls that are BABIES!Given how much she loves her other Baby Alive dolls I jumped on the chance to let her ""test-drive"" this new pair of twins.I was very surprised and disappointed to see that one of the dolls has a heart and crossbones emblazoned on her shirt and pacifier...she is supposed to be a punk rocker in a pirate shirt and her sister is more of the girly girl.
This is a doll with an agenda, to promote diversity, personality type awareness, etc.
Even the term ""crib"" with this set of dolls implies more of a MTV type room than a nursery.In my opinion, this set of Baby Alive Twins just promotes more of the sassy, grow-up-to-fast culture that is stealing childhood from our children.
It is subtle, but it is there.
Let's face it, there is NO difficulty providing our children with examples of diversity, different personalities and lifestyles, etc...if they turn on the tv, listen to the radio or leave the house, they are exposed to diversity.
What they AREN'T exposed to are toys and activites that promote development of nurturing, caregiving, sharing, personal interaction at a meaningful level...something baby dolls have done for little girls for millenia!
This is why I buy BABY dolls!The online features were not important and not used.
The cardboard cribs are useless...flimsy, poorly constructed, and too small.
The dolls have limited play ability because their big heads put them off balance limiting roll play options.Summary:  The little one likes her little twins and watching her with them I'd say they rate ""average"" to her...she prefers her more interactive ""real"" Baby Alive dolls and their furniture.
I rate them one star because there are so many other good dolls to choose from."
"As soon as I opened the package Sarina and Sydney's sweet faces stared up at me.
""Ahhhh,"" I said.
They are so cute!
""Whatcha got, Gramma,"" My granddaughter asked.""Twins!""
I said.
""Aren't they adorable?
""You can dress them up, put them to sleep in their cribs and while they're napping play a game on the computer using a code hidden on their charms.I gave them a 4 on educational because of the game on the computer.
They doll is durable, not so much the cribs, but all is made up for when my granddaughter grins at me as she carries them down the hall, one in her arms, and the other dragging on the floor."
"These two sisters are very cute.
Sarina and Sydney are ""twins"" but have very different personalities.
They each come with removable outfits and Sydney even has a pacifier that snaps in and out of her moth easily.
My 5 year old daughter loves these and puts them into their cribs every night before she go to bed.Having said all that the whole website that goes along with these dolls is pretty boring.
My daughter enjoyed it for a day or two but that is about it.
I do think they are a bit overpriced.
They are very cute though!"
I gave my granddaughter and my niece one doll each from the two that arrived and they played with them throughout an extended weekend visit together.
What can you say about a toy like this?
Um... the figures have that big-eyed look that young kids seem to go for these days (Littlest Pet Shop for example).
The clothes on the dolls are well-made though the figures themselves seem kind of odd to me with the tiny little legs but again, what's an middle-aged guy going to write about a doll?
All I can tell you is the kids really enjoyed them and they'll pull 'em out and play again next time they have a visit.
My granddaughter lives with us and I do see her playing with this from time-to-time but not a lot.
I think the idea of splitting them up with two kids the same age worked well.
"ok so i gave these to my 11 year old daughter who still has a huge imagination to play with dolls.
the first thing is she thought they were adorable...and they are.
the ""cribs"" are made of filmsy cardboard (?)
but since she is older, she will take care of those as best as possible.
it only came with cardboard accessories (one each) and only one doll had a pacifier.
the price is a bit expensive considering these dolls don't do anything and not too much came with them BUT my daughter is happy.
one thing, the heads pop off super easy.
my son took one head off and it continued to fall off even at the grocery store."
I have twin granddaughters, so I was sure these dolls would be perfect for them.
I was right.
My granddaughters carry the dolls with them wherever they go.
The dolls have provided hours of enjoyment for my granddaughters.
Recomended!
This was a really cute set of dolls that my niece enjoyed so much, the dolls come with complete outfits that highlight their different personalities, plus like any sisters you can switch some pieces to make new outfits.
The dolls are nice and sturdy and if given to an age appropriate little girl she can have loads of fun playing with them.
My granddaughter loves the twins.
She is quite active, yet this is one of the few toys she'll spend more than an hour playing calmly & quietly with.
She loves to dress & redress them.
There are numeroous tiny pieces.
At present, she enjoys mixing & matching the tiaras, shoes, charms, etc.
My five year old granddaughter loves this babies.
It's great that their twins so they can talk to each other.
The cardboard cribs they came in are a joke, but the dolls themselves seem well made.
My problem with them .
.
.
now she wants the other dolls in the set.
I don't know why these babies are even called Baby Alive Twins.
They don't eat or drink like the origninal Baby Alive Brand of dolls.
They are small, about six inches tall.
They come with cardboard cribs, and one cardboard pacifier, and one plastic pacifier with skull and crossbones on it (not exactly what I would use on a regular baby doll).
I don't like these dolls at all, they look like hardened criminals right out of the crib!
The doll with crossbones on her shirt has a pink streak painted on her painted plastic hair!
The other twin girl (Sarina) is dressed in a cute ballerina type of dress with tiara, the other in a teenager type of outfit.
One thing my daughter liked about these babies is the fact that they came with a code in the box to play a game online.
They can skateboard and do other things.
Kind of like a teenager wrapped in a toddler's body.
Don't know what Hasbro was thinking when they came up with the idea of these two dolls, but because they were offered to me I took them, otherwise, I don't think this is what I would've chosen for my child to have.
"The Crib Life Twins are yet another take on the toy/online craze pioneered by Webkinz, this time geared specifically for young girls (toy is rates for ages 5+ - I'm guessing because of small pieces and the fact that part of the fun takes place online).Sarina and Sydney Cutie come adorably packaged in a pink box, and each doll measures about 5 1/2"" inches - with very large heads (ala Bratz dolls).
Also inside the box are a Sarina and Sydney keychain/charm, and 2 cribs, which are made of cardboard (a pet peeve for me since non-paper cribs would have been nice.
The dolls also only fit in the cribs standing up, there's not enough room to actually lie them down).
So the dolls themselves are quite durable and good for little kids, but I can't say the same for the cribs which will be easily torn apart.
Sarina is dressed in a cute pink ballerina skirt, while Sydney rocks it out in a pink shirt with a skull, hoodie and black ballerina skirt.As I mentioned above, the dolls are a ""gateway"" to the online community.
The charm has a 2-in-1 code for registering the dolls at criblife.com and playing in the online world.
The website has sections like Crib Life, Games, Crib Chat, as well as some videos.
However, most activities are very basic and there does not seems to be as many interactive options and ability to interact with other users as there were with Webkinz.
It seems as if the website was created sort of as an afterthought to add some ooomph to the dolls, but was not very well thought out.There are a total of 7 different dolls to collect and maybe if the trend catches on, the website will be improved.
The dolls themselves are cute and will likely appeal to little girls, just don't expect too much from the online community."
