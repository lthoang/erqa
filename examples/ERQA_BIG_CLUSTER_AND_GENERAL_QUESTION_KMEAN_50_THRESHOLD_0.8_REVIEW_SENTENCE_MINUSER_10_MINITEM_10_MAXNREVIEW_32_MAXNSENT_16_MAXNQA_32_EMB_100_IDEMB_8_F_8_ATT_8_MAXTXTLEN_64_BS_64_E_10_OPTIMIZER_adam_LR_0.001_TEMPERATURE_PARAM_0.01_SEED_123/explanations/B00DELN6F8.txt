I got this for the 5 and 2 y.o.
grandsons and it has made big hit!
A few years ago the other grandparents got the B&D; work bench and they have had a good time with it but this saw, that makes noise, has been a big deal!
They have sawed every table and chair I have lol even sawed on the walls.
Both boys have enjoyed!
Their mother hinted they need the circular saw next lolOur 5 y.o.
grandson has a good imagination so the lumber, we had a new fence and they have a few boards to play with, has gotten a real workout with this saw.Great Toy!
This looks real enough for kids to feel like they are helping with Dad (or Mom in some cases).
It makes noises and moves so they feel like they are using a real tool.
There is probably a limited market for this, but for families that enjoy building things, this is a great way to introduce kids to woodworking.
Because it looks real, my grandson expected to be able to cut wood with it.
When the wood wouldn't cut, he went looking for stuff that would (the cat, my flowers).
I finally gave him a chunk of bread to smash with the saw and he was content.It's sturdy and looks like it will last for awhile.
Other than replacing the battery, not much to quit working.
Unfortunately it just doesn't do enough to keep his attention.
We have several other black and decker play tools and this was a great one to add to the collection.
My son was fascinated with the jigsaw moving up and down along with the sound of course!
It feels rather lightweight which is why I gave it four stars instead of five, but if your child loves &#34;working&#34; he or she will most likely enjoy this!
This is a fun toy for your little builder.
Pefect if they want ot help saw things.
It looks a lot like the real thing.
Perfect for a two or three year old.
Kids love to copy their dad's...and with a toy like this, it looked possible.
Then again, it's sure to lead to disappointment to some extent because the toy, while making noises, doesn't actually do anything.
While this held interest because of the &#34;new factor&#34; for a few minutes, when I'm using my tools, the kids use their own tools - the ones that can actually screw plastic pieces together, lodge &#34;nails&#34; into plastic, etc.Basically, just because I'm using a jigsaw, doesn't mean my kid does - he prefers to do similar work that actually does something &#34;look dad, I built a...&#34; than just lights up and makes noise.
Either B&D; doesn't think kids can think very abstractly, are hard up for new ideas...or maybe my kid just thinks of &#34;working with tools&#34; instead of &#34;jigsaw!&#34; and proceeds with his own fun.Wouldn't recommend this.
This toy looks very real, and has a plastic jigsaw blade that goes up and down with sound.
Even a little orange light comes on when it's running.
The button in the handle is realistic but easy to depress for small hands.
The jigsaw is sized smaller than a real B&D jigsaw, but otherwise looks very similar.
Any girl or boy (5 years old or younger) would love to play with one of these!!!
Sturdily made so I think it can take some drops and banging around.
This is a nice replica of a B&D; jigsaw.
I would recommend it for ages 3-5.
While it is nice and will be fun for a little while the toy lacks  any interactivity other than squeezing the power button.
I wish some accessories came with the toy to allow a little tool builder to really feel like they were cutting something.
Most kids will play with this for a few minutes and move onto something else.It is decent, just don't expect it to be your child's new favorite toy.
With five boys in the house one would think we would have tons of these 'pretend toys' laying around.We do not.
When the boys were interested,  and old enough my husband would simply have them help on little projects around the house, using real tools.
They just never really got into the fake tool bench kind of thing.But at this price point, why not?
My six year old eagerly tore it up, and I would say it's a fairly accurate replica, though I don't think it looks exactly like the real thing.
When I asked him what he thought about it he said it was pretty cool to play around with, and proceeded to 'jigsaw' my tv stand.If your child is into toys like this, this is an inexpensive investment that they will probably enjoy playing with...for a few days anyways.
