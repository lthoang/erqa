Driving your microdrifter lightning mcqueen on the itty bitty road with the backdrop is pointless and my son looked at me and said ""That's it?"".
MINE INCLUDED WGP LIGHTNING McQUEEN!
The buildings were hard to snap into place, and I ripped one of the stickers trying to get it placed just right.
""All and all it is really cute and basically well-made considering you need to ""build"" the town elements."
I would say 15-30 mins.

Reviews:
"Unless you already have a Micro Drifter collection, the included Lightning McQueen car may be the only car you can fit in here, but if your kids have any other of the items from some of the teensy tiny toy collections that have been popular in recent years (the smallest Littlest Pet Shop items, etc), you can add other items to the tiny trays in the box.Your kids can also use the top as a handy play zone and use the two-lane highway for ""races.
""All and all it is really cute and basically well-made considering you need to ""build"" the town elements."
In my view, the purpose of this carry case is to provide a container in which to store all the cars one is expected to buy.
I've got kids but they haven't shown any interest in these very tiny cars.
The case comes with one car.
The car is teeny tiny.I don't see any other use for this case than the one intended.
"Storage cases seem like they aren't a needed item but we've ended up with at least one for each type of cars that my boys have.
You can just throw toy cars in a box or container but my boys really like having all their collections together.
We have one for their Matchbox cars, one for their Monster Trucks and now we have one for their micro cars.Micro cars are tiny.
There isn't really a good way to store them unless you have a nice case like this one.
My boys automatically said ""Yay, Lightning McQueen"" when they seen it.
It does come with the one car - Lightning.
The case holds up to 40 micro cars.The case itself has a scene on the top that allows the kids to run the car around.
It makes for a good item to take on a trip or to Grandma's because its portable and gives them something to do in a compact size.Here is the Monster Truck case that we bought for their Monster Jam trucks.Hot Wheels Monster Jam Truck CaseThey really love it as well.
Nice graphics and holds the larger trucks."
"This carry case is good as a case.
It has plenty of room to hold the Drifters and holds 40 of them.
However, when the case is opened it ""pops"" open and the cars on the bottom of the case which are not held in with a plastic door pop out of their spots and all over the bottom of the case.
We are keeping as many cars as we can in the top section which has a plastic door.The playset road on top is a nice extra but the buildings are hard to get in and once they are in it is hard to keep them their.
They constantly pop out of the holders and are very flimsy to begin with.THe case also comes with WGP Lightening which comes in so many three packs of the drifters that it feels like it is a waste.
I would much rather see a different car that does not come in any of the three packs or a special edition McQueen.
Another WGP McQueen for a child who most likely has a drifters collection is not necessary because he/she most likely has that car already too.This is a toss up in the end.
Fair holder, but nice to have something that holds more drifters than the Mack truck case."
CAUTION: This is not built for 'Hot Wheels' size cars, it is specifically designed for 'Micro Drifters'.
Hot Wheels/Matchbox style cars WILL NOT FIT.
Micro Drifters are about 1/3 the size of a Hot Wheel.
That said, the case comes with one Micro Drifter in the style of Lightning McQueen.
It is a little car with a large ball bearing the peeks out of the bottom of the car, causing the car to 'drift' around when you roll it.
Pretty cool!Overall, the case is a very attractive kit to carry around your vehicles and has a nice build, no worrying about it flopping open unless intended.Pros:- Sturdy closing latch with a slick push-button release to open- Snaps onto other Micro Drifter playsets to add 'stadium seating' or a small backdrop- Attractive design, large CARS logo on the case, little building backdrops built-in, spoiler shaped handle- Holds FORTY cars.
That's a ton.- Lots of decals included to dress up the whole playsetCons:- Large CARS logo looks nice, but doesn't 'do' anything and keeps the case from sitting flush when in the 'briefcase' mode- The decals came rolled up inside the case, so they were deformed and a little difficult to apply- Strong spring causes the case to flip open very quickly when the push-button is pressed.
Could cause some damage if the child is careless.
"This is a cute little carrying case for Micro Cars.
It has a little Main Street ""strip"" on the top that allows kids to play with their cars on top.Putting together this puppy takes a little time.
I would say 15-30 mins.
All the stickers are a pain to place.
I'm not sure why they can't just be put on in production?
And the town standups are a little difficult to place - especially Tow Mater's shop - not sure why.
If your kid is rough with stuff, you will find yourself ra-attaching these standups alot.
It also comes with two flags that can not stay in the holes and still close, so they have to just go in the box and are the first thing my son lost.This comes with one Lightning McQueen car.
The box opens with a spring loaded button like an old-style pencil case, which is cool.
But unfortunately, when my son pushes it, the box flips open with such a vengeance that all the cars inside fly out.
Not a big issue, but irritating when out in public.Overall, this carrying case seems like it will last a long time and is pretty thick so it won't break.
I think this is the cutest car carrying case I've ever seen."
This is a cute little case for the Cars mini drifters.
When those little things are loose, they are a lot like legos - you literally don't see them unless you are stepping on them or you are checking to see what the dog is chomping on.It was a little annoying to put the gates on the top of it.
The clue is on the side of the package.
They go on flat, snap in, and then flip up.
I know that doesn't make sense.Anyway, with my two new sets, I will be up to about 20 Cars for my case.
Three of them are the same car and children keep telling me that this is all wrong.
These cars are a lot of fun and cute.I also like how it sets up into a grandstand.
This makes it an interesting sidekick to the raceway.
The Cars Micro Drifter Fast Flip Carry Case is not really a toy.
It is a carry case.
So if you are look for something with a lot of play in it, this is not your best bet.
This is fine for coralling the micro drifter cars you have acquired.
We have micro drifters and the Cars Squinkies in ours.
As a play set it doesn't really work very well.
It doesn't seem terribly sturdy but will still work as a case.
"This thing was not at all what I expected.
It is about the size of a shoebox and comes with a ton of little parts to snap into place and store.
Driving your microdrifter lightning mcqueen on the itty bitty road with the backdrop is pointless and my son looked at me and said ""That's it?"".
Yep, that is it.The box is a pain in the butt to open, it takes some real work to get it open and then when you do get it open  it springs open and everything inside falls out.
There is a plastic wall on one of the sides of the holder to keep things in place but that is also really difficult to open.The carrier is really compact but with the decorations sticking up it is hard to store.
It has to go on the top of a pile and you cannot stack anything on it.
My son had no interest in this and it was just taking up space so we recycled it.
We don't miss it at all.This might make a good item for a serious microdrifter collector, but to anyone else it is a high priced piece of plastic."
Out of the box, assembly takes a few minutes what with positioning stickers and insterting the buildings - one or two were a bit tough and would frustrate a child.
It is a storage case that doubles as seating for one, not all, of the race tracks in this line.
As much as my son LOVES Cars and McQueen, this held his interest for 30 minutes.
Then again, these cars are TINY!!!
So a storage unit makes sense.
"If you have a ""Cars"" fan, this will be a sure winner for one who enjoys collecting.
Sets of ""Cars"" Micro Drifters, which are small, plastic, fixed-wheel racers that glide along by means of a steel ball, are available in three-packs; it takes thirteen three-packs to fill this case to capacity when combined with the included WGP Lightning McQueen Micro Drifter.
This Fast Flip Carry Case has two tabs on its underside, which act as a mount for the case to be a grandstand attached to theFast Flip Transforming Raceway.This is a substantially sturdy case, considering it is plastic.
It locks tight with two tabs that open with the press of an easily accessible button on the front at the lower-right corner, so be careful not to pry to get the box open, otherwise you may break a tab.
After pressing the button, the springs fling the top up swiftly, providing access to the lower grandstand ""seating,"" whereas a clear plastic cover keeps the upper grandstand storage compartments enclosed.
The clear plastic cover, with some effort, can be lifted up as a canopy over the grandstands.
While open, two plastic flags can be stuck into post holes of the upper level, but they look odd being vertical to the upper level which rests at an incline; there is no dedicated storage for the flags, though a few side slots are wide enough to store them, they will move about once the lid is turned down to close the case.When I was young, I loved to apply stickers to new toys, and apparently, I still do.
It takes a steady hand to apply the six thin road stripes, one handle banner, two grandstand banners and four play surface backgrounds to get them just right.
Once the stickers are in place, there are four plastic, collapsible pop-up facades to attach to the playfield: three buildings with openings large enough for the Micro Drifters to glide through, and a stack of tires, which somewhat resembles a totem pole.The set is for ages four and up, and the cars are a blast to zip around, but I would worry to leave too small of a child to play with the set unattended.
The Micro Drifter autos are esophagus-sized, and the flags are tiny too.
The whole Micro Drifters concept seems ""geared"" to be a collecting thing, and it is definitely something I would have been into at six to eight or so.
Collectible sets are always fun, and Micro Drifters are pretty awesome in that regard.
I recommend these for supervised four to five year old children, or for any ""Cars""-loving collector from six on up, who wants a set that takes little space, with a broad selection of fun, unique pieces available for purchase."
"I have to start by saying that if you are a fan of frustration-free packaging, this carrying case is going to drive you nuts.
It looks simple enough, after all, it's basically a box with a handle inside a box, right?
Wrong.
It took some wrangling to get this thing out of a very, very sturdy package.
As if that weren't enough, you'd expect it to be ready to go out of the box, instead, there is some assembly required.
It's not all that much, but it is something to consider if your child is sitting there waiting thinking he's going to get to play any time soon.The carrying case itself is made of sturdy plastic that seems like it will hold up well over time.
However, opening the case was perhaps more frustrating than opening the box it came in.
As I currently have a sprained wrist, when I had difficulties getting the case open, I turned to my six-year old.
We could both get one side started but couldn't get the whole thing opened.
I'm not exaggerating when I say that we tried for a full ten minutes.
I kept thinking that my wrist must be worse than I thought.
Then, suddenly, it was like the skies opened up (albeit indoors) and lit on a little button clever hidden in one of the front corners.
A simple push and this baby snapped right open (and snapped is probably a kind word for the sort of jerking motion that occurs when the hinge is loosened at the push of that button).Once we got the opening figured out, my daughter and I worked on applying stickers to designated locations on the box.
There are very clear, very precise locations for each sticker.
They are sort of cut into the case but once the stickers are placed, you get a smooth surface.
The next step is to snap on the little pieces that indicate store fronts from Cars Land.Once this was done, I handed it over to the two-year old who had a ball racing the tiny little micro drifter along the road on the case.
We have a 3-year-old friend who visits often and looks forward to playing with the toys at our house.
He loves Cars, and while we don't have any of the MicroDrifters, I thought he would enjoy playing with other cars with this backdrop.
Not being familiar with MicroDrifters, I thought the car size was probably similar to Matchbox-size cars.
I was wrong.
The MicroDrifter cars are much smaller, so  it definitely would not work for storing other cars.
However, the description led me to believe that it didn't come with any cars, but it does indeed come with Lightning McQueen (as shown in the picture).
For our little friend, that is enough.
He has enjoyed playing with that one car, and using the top of the case as a play set.We found it tricky to assemble.
The buildings were hard to snap into place, and I ripped one of the stickers trying to get it placed just right.
I'm not sure how durable it would be in the long run, as it just gets occasional play at our house, but it's been a nice addition to our toy box, as is.
THIS IS A GREAT TOY THAT YOU CAN PACK AND GO!
WHEN YOU GET 'TO THE RACES' YOU CAN UNPACK -'WATCH'- AND BE PART OF THE 'CARS' SCENE.
WHAT FUN!
YOU ALSO LEARN HOW TO ORGANIZE, PACK AND UNPACK, AND JUST HAVE FUN.

JESUS' BLESSINGS AND PEACE
I have 6 yr old twins who adore Cars.
I got this thinking it would go over well.
While they love playing with it, you have to use the Micro cars, and it's not adaptable for say, Hot Wheels.
Nevertheless, play with it they did.
The case is nice, it holds about 40 cars.
The track is fun.
The buildings were a pain to snap in and don't stay in real well.
The stickers din't stay put for even an hour.
The whole set is pretty flimsy.
Overall, great idea, more care and details in design, please.
As a case, I suppose this serves its purpose.
It is not much fun at all to play with as a track for the cars.
There's no room for actual play.
The pieces on the top are hard to get into place and tiny.
The case can be difficult to open and close and the cars tend to spill out when doing either one.
If you just need a case for your Drifters and you love the Cars movie, this is a decent item to add to your collection for storage purposes, but not much else.
My son loves Disney Cars.
The Disney/Pixar Cars Micro Drifters carry case is a neat toy for kids that love the cars characters.
This toy is for storing or playing with Micro Drifters cars which are small or mini cars of the Disney Cars characters.
This toy is fun and would be good for kids 3+.
I guess I did not read this right when I first looked at it-I assumed it was a case for ALL small cars-I was in error.
This is just for Micro Drifters cars.
I was hoping it would fit my sons Mattel and other small cars he had.
They should have made the product more commercial so other cars could fit.
Just another toy that you have to buy the Disney/Pixar cars for.My son did not like this carrying case at all.Thumbs down!
My son was interested in the Flip Case and he has no Micro Machines so he didn't know what to expect.
It's obvious from the directions inside that this is meant not only as a carry case but as the grandstand for a racing set.
So naturally he saw the picture and decided he wants the racing set.
Something to consider if you don't have the other piece.When you press the button to open the case, it flings open with some serious force.
In fact, when I had him first try the button, it opened so violently that the items stored inside all came flying out.The little stores (from Cars) that attach to the top and flip up are very cute but ours don't quite fit properly.
They can't flip up and down; if we flip them, they pop out.
Also the gray flags that you put in place when using the case as a grandstand cannot stay in place when the case is closed.
I assume they can fit inside the case when it's full of Micro Machines but can't say for sure.He likes the road atop the case and driving the included Lightning McQueen in and out of the shops atop the case.For us, if he decides to get more Micro Machines, this will be a good storage piece, once he's used to the fact that it flies open when he pushes the button (the button is easy to push and instantly responsive).
It's compact with a sturdy handle that's easy for small hands to grip.
As a toy, it leaves something to be desired.He played with it for about five minutes and lost interest.Also a note on the packaging: the handle is fixed and therefore to get it out of the packaging, you have to rip or cut the very sturdy cardboard.
The packing isn't made in a way that allows easy release of the toy.
"I think this a is a cheap piece of plastic junk, but my 7 yr old loves it, hence the three-star rating.
These are the issues that I have with it:1) The plastic building fronts do not snap easily into place, and you have to put stickers on it, which start to peel off not long after.2) The ""lanes"" are not even wide enough for the drifter cars -- they have to ""drift"" down the middle of the street.3) It only fits drifters, not any of the other mini Pixar cars, which means, if you don't already have drifters, you get to buy 39 cars to fill it.Reasons that my son loves it:1) It connects to theDisney/Pixar Cars Micro Drifters Trackset, and functions as a ""stadium.
""2) It comes with a Lightning McQueen drifter car.3) My son thinks it's great, period.
He doesn't care about any of the issues that I complained about.Since children are the target for this product, I suppose my opinion doesn't matter as much as my son's, but I think the entire Drifter product line is over-priced compared to the other available Cars product lines, and cheaply made compared to other Cars items."
This is a sturdy, well-designed carrying case for all those little Drifters Disney cars that kids love.
It holds four of them.
Now, it won't hold Hot Wheels size cars.
It's made for Drifters.
It was a big tricky to put together, but a little time and patience took care of that.
The 4 year old loves it; that's the main thing.
For kids who are crazy about the Disney Micro Drifters.
This is a cute little case if your child is absolutely crazy about Disney's cars; except make sure that you have the Micro Drifters cars.
Those are the only ones that will fit in this case.
It holds 40 of those cars, so you can see how small they are.
They are definitely not for small children; even the recommended age 4 might be too young for these tiny cars and the tiny pieces that are a part of the case as it assembles into the grandstand.The case folds out as a grandstand, but the extra pieces like the flags and the buildings are hard to set in and even harder to move the cars back and forth for storage.Putting the case together is not the easiest task and certainly not one a younger child can do.
This is a toy with limited usage and sadly seems to be something that my grandchildren were not that enthused over.
