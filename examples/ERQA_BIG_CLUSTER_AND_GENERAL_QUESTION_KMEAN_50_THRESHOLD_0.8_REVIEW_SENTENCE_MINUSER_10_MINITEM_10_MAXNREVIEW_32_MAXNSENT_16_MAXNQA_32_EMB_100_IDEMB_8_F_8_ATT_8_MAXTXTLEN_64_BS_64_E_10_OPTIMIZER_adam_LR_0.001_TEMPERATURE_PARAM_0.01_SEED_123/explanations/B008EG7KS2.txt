Top sentence(s):
I've noticed that the doll switches back and forth from English to Spanish quite often because Bren is pressing the stomach for too long at one time, but it doesn't seem to bother her at all.
She also gets a kick out of tickling its tummy until it squirms.The walking aspect is a little curious - sometimes the toy will intentionally walk poorly, while shouting ""don't let go!""
We highly recommend this doll though, if it can survive my Hurricane Ella, the durability on this doll it 5 stars PLUS!
When you press the doll's tummy, she has the cutest giggle.
I can't determine a difference between the demo and on modes.Whatever mode she's in, she curiously lapses into Spanish sometimes, exchanging ""Hi Mommy"" for ""Ola Mommy,"" etc.

Reviews:
"This doll is so stinkin' cute and with her hazel eyes and brunette pig tails, she looks a lot like my daughter.
My little one is younger than the recommended age (she is 14 months) and she's learning to walk while holding our hands.
I thought it would be fun for her to have a doll that is going through the same experience that she is.
Baby Alive walks easily on both the tiled parts and carpeted areas of our home.
She uses about 40 phrases and her voice is very sweet (not scary like so many other talking toys).
As an added bonus she also speaks Spanish when her tummy is pressed.
I'm a huge fan of bilingual toys, so I'm thrilled about this feature.
This doll tells ""mommy"" exactly what she needs (for example, when she needs help walking and when to let go) and this can help teach little girls to be nurturing caregivers.
My daughter is very fascinated with the ""baby"" (as she refers to her) and I can't say enough good things about this doll."
As a parent, you have to take the bad with the good.
Quite often, you're going to be buying toys that are extremely annoying, but your kids will love them.
This is one of those toys.
There's something a little eerie about watching a doll walking on its own in that stiff, dollish way.
However, when it brings enjoyment to your kid, that's what matters.Baby Wanna Walk is very durable, and really is being loved by my daughter.
It's not the kind of doll she'll be able to bring with her on trips or cuddle with, but it passes the time as an actual PLAYthing instead of just a cuddle buddy (which is very important).
By having a companion (even in doll form), it helps to start some social interactions.HIghly recommended.
This doll is absolutely adorable!!
No, she is not one to cuddle, but she is tons of fun to play with!
With so many dolls on the market today, it is hard to pick one - just like everything else, lol.
However, Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk is the perfect choice for any little girl - 3+ who loves dolls!
This little doll is perfect for playing house with, she is incredibly interactive, responsive and will have your child, or any child you give this to, clutching her with love and excitement!
My daughter is 10 and thought this was the cutest thing - honestly I couldn't agree more, lol.
I am anxious to have my 3 year old niece try her out, as she is an avid baby doll girl.With the mechanics, you may wonder how well she works, annoying sounds, lags in movement, etc.
I can truly say that there are absolutely no issues, thus far, with any of these things.
She walks well, when she speaks it is clear, rather than tinnie or annoying and I have yet to find fault with any of those issues.Baby Wanna Walk is simply tons of giggling fun and will have children and children at heart smiling and laughing right along with her.
She will also make any child a loyal and faithful playmate that, while she is battery operated and moves, talks, etc, will also allow imaginations to soar.
I highly recommend this sweet little doll to anyone who loves baby dolls!
This doll is adorable!
The vinyl is soft enough to cuddle, but also firm enough to be durable while she walks around the house.
Her voice is cute and clear.
She balances well as she walks, with no tipping.
Definitely a toy to make any little girl's eyes light up with joy!
"Baby dolls continue to change each year as manufacturers look for creative enhancements and ways to make the dolls more up to date with modern times.
Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk is a good example of these changes in action.
She can walk on her own, makes more than forty different statements, responds in ways that are suitable to what is going on around her, and has bilingual ability.The original Baby Alive doll was pioneering because she was the first doll, as far as I know, that could eat food.
This doll uses the Baby Alive name, but rather than eat and drink, she shows her realistic abilities by walking and talking.
This is not only a nice change from other dolls, it is much more cost effective for parents.
One problem with the eating and drinking dolls is that you have to continuously buy food packets and new diapers.
There is no such expense with this doll.
She devotes her time to walking and talking and about the only necessary maintenance is changing her batteries.Walking and talking isn't anything original, but the manufacturer made a good effort when it created the different sayings and the way the statements are timed to occur at just the right moment.
Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk says many different things, but she has many more of them than other dolls and she often times them just right.
For example, if she stumbles and falls, she will say things like ""oops, I'm okay.""
If she is ready to take a walk, she will say ""hold on tight"" as she waits for her mommy to take her by the hand.
This is more advanced than other talking dolls, most of which make statements at random- statements that have little to do with what is taking place around them.As for the walking, Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk is very good in this area as well.
She walks easily across a tile floor or carpet and she makes proud, self- congratulatory remarks as she paces from one part of the room to the next.
As long as the carpet isn't too thick, she will have no problem.
The best bet is to use a flat rug or tile floor.
If she does fall, don't worry- she will make a statement of reassurance to the child, then prepare to try again.Another interesting fact about Baby Alive Baby Wanna Walk is her bilingual ability.
Baby Alive, Baby Wanna Walk is so much fun!
She toddles on carpet and hardwood floors equally well.I love her voice.
It's so sweet and clear sounding,not the voice of a toddler, but not annoying either.
She is bilingual, which is fun as well.
The girls loved her falling down phrases the best.
They really became engaged in mothering her.I was surprised to find that when you sit her down, she has completely different phrases!
Instead of the walking chatter, it's all about tickling!
And her giggles had us all laughing too.Overall, I think this is our favorite Baby Alive doll.
She's just so much fun to listen to, and interact with.
Baby Wanna Walk is a sweetie!
It's not a normal doll, in that it's mostly plastic and has stiff hinged joints, oh and it can walk as well.This doll really only does one thing, but it's cute, and kids seem to like it.
Basically if she's standing and you raise her arms up she'll try to walk with the child's help, and then give directions to the child.
The doll will also appear to almost fall down like it's wobbly.
You can also put her in a sitting position as well.Our daughter (two and a half years old) has some fun with this, but she only gets played with every few weeks or so.
Not sure if she's just too young, or it just simply doesn't hold her interest.
The Baby Wanna Walk, Brunette by Baby Alive is by far the best doll that came out from the Baby Alive series.
Where others would laugh, talk or giggle, the Baby Wanna Walk adds walking to its ensemble of features making this doll super fun for kids.
Although this doll was meant for kids 3+ years of age, my 20-month old daughter, with minimal adult supervision, did not have any problem interacting with this doll.
The initial reaction was shock at first, she maybe thinking how a doll could walk towards her.
After a few hours, she has warmed up to the doll and walks beside the doll as it walks.This doll could practically walk in any surface of your house.
The addition of making this doll walk has multiplied the fun value for you now have talking and walking in the same doll.
They are powered by 4 AA batteries that I would say lasts quite a bit.
No movement on the doll doesn't consume any power so power should not be an issue.
The doll came in a sturdy, see-thru packaging and would take an adult to open it for a child.
As with any other Baby Alive Dolls, the impact these kinds of dolls have on children is they develop a sense of caring.
Seeing my daughter's face everytime she interacts with this doll is priceless.
Highly recommended!
!
My 6 year old literally tore the packaging open when this doll arrived, she was so excited to have her!
While she's just a basic (as in, no extra frills or accessories kinda Doll), that was fine with Ella, it left less to open or take apart from the packaging, and she's a simple girl.
She loves that she talks, and says more once I took her off demo mode (which the batteries are still lasting on even though they are included just for demo purposes, we haven't had to replace them yet), she walks and asks for help often, which Ella delights in!
One issue we had, which we ALWAYS have with my daughter, is water.
She wanted to get her new doll wet, she wants to get every new toy wet, and I told her this would ruin the doll and she wouldn't walk or talk after.
Ella snuck her in the bathroom to wash her hair at some point and I busted her, and the doll was fairly soaked, but she was not ruined, which was VERY impressive to me.
So this doll is VERY durable, which again is VERY impressive to me.
Ella didn't fully immerse her doll or anything, just tried to wash her hair or whatever as girls will do, but it wet her back and clothes, and yada yada yada.
Anyways, I scolded her and she was really worried she broke the doll and hopefuly learned her lesson since she clearly thought she would be able to only get the hair wet and not the rest of the doll.
Kids will be kids, I suppose.
We highly recommend this doll though, if it can survive my Hurricane Ella, the durability on this doll it 5 stars PLUS!
And Ella really does enjoy her new doll, she often bores of toys quickly.
Definitly Ella approved and Mom approved!
Educational value we give 4 stars instead of 5 because while it does encourage interaction and Mommy/Child play, I don't think it is as educational as a lot of toys out there.
Still worthy of 5 stars overall though.
After seeing this toy in the store and being told that she could not have it (birthday was coming up), my best friend's daughter screamed and cried as we dragged her out of the store.
I, of course, went back and bought the doll.
Let's say that throwing tantrums can sometimes lead to getting what you want.
After wrapping the doll and setting it out as a birthday gift, I felt confident that it would be a favorite.
I was not wrong.
Bren turned 3 last week and shrieked when she open up her gift to find this doll.
Daddy (who had taken the out of the box duties) could not get it out of the box quickly enough, and I'm proud to say that all other gifts were forgotten (for about 7 minutes, because she is 3 and has a short attention span).
The doll stood on the grass right next to Bren as she tore through other packages, and then was quickly incorporated into all park activities.The general squeal of happiness every time that Bren touched the dolls stomach and she started moving her feet was well worth the price.
I mean, how often can you make a little girl so happy?
The doll is very cute when it walks.
It is a little unsteady on it's feet and leans forward like she will fall from time to time.
I assume that once Bren is a little older, she will probably allow the baby to walk for more than a second at a time.
At the moment, the doll spends most of the time off of her feet and in Bren's arms.
The tummy is pretty sensitive and will start speaking with barely any pressure, which leads to endless giggles and shrieks from Bren.
I've noticed that the doll switches back and forth from English to Spanish quite often because Bren is pressing the stomach for too long at one time, but it doesn't seem to bother her at all.
This may end up being an added benefit, as she may end up learning some Spanish words as she plays.Overall, this was a great success.
"My 17-month old daughter loves this doll, and is able to get it on its feet and activate its walking mode.
She also gets a kick out of tickling its tummy until it squirms.The walking aspect is a little curious - sometimes the toy will intentionally walk poorly, while shouting ""don't let go!""
Letting go during this phase usually results in the doll tipping over, and saying ""Whoa!
I'm okay.""
After this phase, the doll will shout to be unhanded, so she can walk on her own, which usually succeeds, followed by an ""I did it!""
Activating the walking mode is a little challenging.
It appears to involve some combination of lifting and twisting one or both arms, repeatedly, until the doll gets the hint.The other interaction with the doll involves pressing a large button on her tummy, that first causes her to laugh, and, when pressed repeatedly, causes her to wiggle her legs too.The legs of the doll can be articulated, at the hip, to put the doll in a seated position.
She doesn't appear to move her legs once placed in this position.There is a three-position switch on the back of her neck: one mode is ""demo,"" one is off, and one is a regular ""on"" mode.
I can't determine a difference between the demo and on modes.Whatever mode she's in, she curiously lapses into Spanish sometimes, exchanging ""Hi Mommy"" for ""Ola Mommy,"" etc.
Switching the power off and back on returns her to English mode.
I don't see any discussion in the manual of how to place her permanently into one language or the other.All told, this is a cute doll with reasonably good bipedal walking that engages and entertains my little girl, and will probably do the same for yours.
Bonus: she'll be getting some bilingual exposure!"
Both my girls, ages 3 and 8, love this doll.
The 3 year-old cries when we make her put it away at bedtime.
It's engaging and interactive, and the walking motion is great, almost looking like she's going to fall over before righting herself.
There is one annoying thing.
Pressing her chest for a couple seconds changes the language between English and Spanish, which means my daughter changes it by accident every 5 minutes just from hugging her.
Otherwise an excellent toy.
"I got this for my granddaughter, age 5.
She is very nurturing to her ""babies"" and loved this doll.
Her brunette hair is the same color as this doll, a rich, shiny, chestnut.
The instructions said although it comes with batteries, they should be replaced before play, as they get used in testing out the doll in the box by shoppers.
I figured this wouldn't be a problem with Amazon, but changed them so my granddaughter would have uninterrupted play.
The doll says so many cute phrases, like ""Hold on tight!""
She has over 40 phrases so it feels more like a real child in play instead of saying the same thing over and over and the speech is easy to understand.
My granddaughter held the doll's hands to get her started walking, to show her how, and then the doll took off toddling on her own, much to my granddaughter's delight.
It says she walks best on a hard surface, but she also did fine on a low pile carpeting.
When you press the doll's tummy, she has the cutest giggle.
She is the perfect size for a young girl, about 12-14 inches or so, her clothes feel quality, skin very soft, and she is soft enough to cuddle with at bedtime, not hard and pointy like some dolls.
She is my granddaughter's ""best baby EVER, Granny!"""
This doll is the cutest thing ever!
I think it is one of the best out of the Baby Alive product line.
It actually walks and talks and this particular doll (brunette) speaks english and spanish.You can alternate between the 2 languages by pressing the button on her stomache,she says a variety of different phrases.Once you hold her arms up she starts walking...it looks pretty weird at first almost as if she is about to topple over.
But once she gets going it's super cute... just like a real life toddler.This is a very basic doll which requires no asssembly or extra accessories.
The hardest part is getting her out of the actual box so have your screwdriver and scissors ready.She is packaged very well.The doll does come with some demo batteries but I suggest you change them out with your own for longer run time.
All in All I think this is a very nice doll that little girls will enjoy.
"My 8 year old granddaughter has several different Hasbro ""Baby Alive"" themed dolls.
She has the original, the twin boy and girl set and the potty Baby Alives.
However, Baby Wanna Walk is her favorite.
This doll is interactive.
She walks with help from ""mommy"", walks on her own, and by touching her hands quickly, you can see if she will walk all by herself.
She has legs that can sit and you can tickle her tummy while she giggles and says random baby things.
When she falls down, she has separate phrases that she speaks.
In fact she has over 40 different responses for everything she does!A very adorable doll that my granddaughter LOVES and yours will also!"
"Alright so I'm big on education and think toys should reflect reality.
This doll talks like a 2 year old but with a 6 yr old voice - why can't she speak properly if her voice is 6 years old?
And babies learn to walk at 12 months - not at 6 or 2, so this doll isn't in line with reality.
I'd give this doll negative on educational value.Very stable on her feet, if you knock her over she gleefully says, ""Oops!
I'm OK"" and Lil Mama has to put her back on her feet again.What a hit with the little one though!
Hopefully preschooler will tire of this toy before the features (""40+ phrases and sounds"") drive mom insane!"
"When you turn the switch on the back of the neck to ""on"" you squeeze the tummy and the doll says she wants to walk.
(Note that the doll speaks far too well for someone learning how to walk, but then I guess that's better than having to listen to poorly pronounced words and the same bad grammar patterns all the time.)
She asks you to hold her hands.
When you do, she starts walking.
If she starts to fall, she says ""Woah!""
and if you catch her she'll tell you thank you for saving her, but if she falls she says ""I'm OK, let's try again.""
After you help her walk for a little bit, she tell you to let go and let her try on her own.
The walking motion very much resembles a baby learning how to walk--I was certain she was going to biff it at any second, but somehow managed to keep on her feet most of the time.
My two girls enjoyed playing with this toy for a short while, but lost interest fairly quickly, although I partly blame that on the fact that there was a lot of other stuff going on at the time.
We'll see how they like it in a day or so...
I think the fact that this doll talks makes it more fun, but it also takes some imagination out of play and that in turn makes it get old faster; sort of an interesting paradox of sorts...
However, you CAN just switch the doll off and then it can do tea parties and whatever else just as well as any Barbie or other non-animitronic doll."
"I thought my three year old would love this doll, with it being interactive and all.
Well, not so much.
It's not the doll's fault though, she really is adorable.
My daughter just isn't a toy person.
She played with the doll initially, for a short while and here and there since, but that's about it.
That said, I did not buy this doll.
I was able to get one for the purpose of writing a review.
Knowing my daughter like I do, I would not have shelled out $40 for this item.
If you have a similar child who is not into conventional toys that much, I don't think I would recommend a toy like this.
Besides that, the doll is great.
She talks (alot) and giggles.
She starts to walk when you hold her hand, and even says ""don't let go, mommy!""
Her walking is quite realistic too.
My husband described it as ""creepy"" because of the genuine aspect of it.
This is not a good doll for holding or otherwise taking care of.
She likes to walk and talk, and that's about it.
This is the CUTEST thing!!
Very sturdy and well-made.
Very cute ,easy to understand voice and infectious giggle.
My dog went nuts running from room to room looking for the little kid to play with.
The doll has an unsteady, toddler-like walk and I expected her to do a face-plant any minute but she did very well.OK, I'll admit I had a little trouble getting her out of the box but I guess first you have to be smarter than the box.
If you're anything like me you might want to get her out of the box, find a phillips screwdriver, be sure you have fresh batteries, and replace the demo batteries  before you call it to the attention of an impatient three-year-old.
I especially like that the battery cover is held on with a screw so it won't fall off or be picked off by tiny fingers.Also comes in Blonde or african-american.
