Top sentence(s):
(I suspect her Polly Pockets will eventually be brought in to play here.)
"The Tonka Tumble Tower *looks* like it should be a lot of fun, and it is, I suppose (I was initially excited to play with it, myself, and my ten-year-old daughter found it very amusing, is still playing with it an hour later, and has expressed reluctance to pass it on to her 3-year-old cousin as planned).
The highly repetitive and non-creative elements of the toy is not likely to sustain a kid's interest for long - encouraging freestyle play - mixing with other playsets, etc is a far better option to get value from this playset."
In my estimation it falls short of being outstanding enough to earn 5 stars, but it's what I hoped it would be.It's worth noting there are a few different sizes of Tonka Chuck and Friends vehicles.
Yes, you can turn off completely, but there isn't a quieter option on this toy, unlike many toys with sounds.Even with these imperfections, my just turned 3 year old likes is, and still pulls it out to play with it about a month later.

Reviews:
In the latest reincarnation of Tonka's wildly popular CHUCK line, tots can navigate Chuck through the obstacles of a construction site.
My 2 and a half year old, like his bigger Chuck, so it was no surprise he was delighted with this as well.
The set makes noises, the truck slides and tumbles, and there is even an elevator.
The set while not Tonka tough is at least toddler resistant and doesn't contain dozens of small pieces.
It's also good sized, about a little smaller then my boy is sitting.
The price point makes it an attractive toy as a gift.
I could easily see how an older child may lose interest, as my six year old did in minutes flat.
I have a 2 yo son, a 5 yo daughter and a 7 yo son who have really enjoyed playing with this toy.
I love that the tumbling towers ramps don't have to be pieced together each time they play.
There aren't any parts to find, except the tower structure and Chuck (the truck).
When the kids need to pick up, they can just fold up the two ramps that extend out, and carry it back to where it belongs!
It's much sturdier than some other ramp type car toys my kids have had over the years.However, we have found it a bit frustrating that Chuck often tips over at the end of the last tipping ramp and gets stuck between the two walls instead of rolling through them, on down to the floor.
We've tried different methods to try to prevent it, but it usually happens anyway.There really isn't any educational value in this toy.
It's fun to hear Chuck talk to you, and it's fun to drive over, under, around the tumbling towers structure.
Watching Chuck roll down the ramps is fun, until you get too frustrated by how often he gets hung up at the bottom.
But that's it.
Unless your child is a whiz-kid, doing a study of physics (gravity, force, motion) it really isn't educational.It also doesn't hold their attention for TOO long since it has limited creative play options.
At least when they get bored with it, putting it away is simple.
When they feel like watching something race down ramps and alternate between racing across the floor or crashing, they'll get it back out again.
Mine always do.
"My little boy(2 1/2) has the big ""Rumbling Chuck"" truck already, so when he saw the ""Little Chuck"" that comes with the ramp, he was very excited.I've noticed it's not often that he picks this toy to play with, but when he does he seems to really enjoy it.
The litte truck doesn't always ride down the ramp like it's suppose to, but it doesn't seem to be that big of a deal.
There's plenty of times that it has worked fine.
It has proved pretty durable so far.
My little boy is very small for his age(about 20 pounds), but he's stood on top of it some, and it's held up fine.
He's also pulled the ramp that folds out off, but it goes back on fine, too.I just want to point out that if you're familiar with the ""Stand and Play Ramp"", this is much smaller(but a much smaller price tag, too).
It stands about 12-14 inches tall.Overall, we have been very pleased with this toy so far!!"
I have other fold and go toys for my son - the rock quarry, the firehouse and the garage.
The rock quarry has the most durable and least frustrating design.
It is a 5 star rated toy in my opinion, if your child is obsessed with Chuck and Friends.
The fire station is the worst - the pole feature (the cars do the equivalent of a human sliding down a pole) is very difficult to work.
Handy's garage is not bad, but the ramps dettach on their own way too often.This one is on the flimsy side, but seems more durable Handy's garage.
I'm just concerned about the longevity of the ramps staying attached.
"I was excited about getting this Tonka Fold and Go Tower because I grew up with a Tonka trunk and I know how much kids love car ramps.
I thought it would be a great combination but I was disappointed with the product.The main feature of this toy that intrigued me was the ""fold and go"" feature.
I like the idea of a toy folding up so that it does not take up as much room.
While this tower does have two folding ramps, it does not make the toy that much more compact.Because they tried to make the toy compact, the tower itself is very unsteady (it fell over several times the first time my daughter played with it).
The sounds that the toy makes are annoying and do not add that much to the toy.The toy only comes with one truck (Chuck).
I wish that it came with at least two or three.While I would not recommend this toy, I do think that Tonka makes a lot of great products.
We have a number of the Chuck and Friends vehicles and my daughter loves to play with those on their own."
"The Tonka Tumble Tower *looks* like it should be a lot of fun, and it is, I suppose (I was initially excited to play with it, myself, and my ten-year-old daughter found it very amusing, is still playing with it an hour later, and has expressed reluctance to pass it on to her 3-year-old cousin as planned).
The problem is that, as other reviewers have noted, the ramps and/or truck are not aligned precisely enough for the truck to reliably complete its way down.
In fact, it's actually very reliable that the truck will get jammed.
It gets through often enough to give some measure of satisfaction, but Tonka *really* should have designed this better.For durability, it looks great.
Very solid pieces.
It will last for years, and could be passed down from one child to another.
No worries about pieces breaking off and presenting choking hazards for the under-3 set (who will love this toy).The sound effects include a ""child"" making various appreciative comments about the play action.
Young kids will enjoy this, but it gets annoying.
Fortunately, there is an on/off switch.Only one truck is included (the toy's value would have been improved considerably by including at least two), but my daughter quickly brought in other cars to use with the tower (Hot Wheels work, though they get jammed on the ramp a lot, too), and after reading another review, I suggested that she use balls on the ramp.
Small rubber balls run down the ramp very well (better than the cars, though they shoot out the sides sometimes; that ramp just really isn't aligned), and they perfectly fit in the dump truck as cargo (but use bigger balls if the toy is to be played with by a child under 3).
Folded up (which takes just seconds), the toy's footprint is only about 12x3 inches.Overall, the tower is a fun, but at the same time, disappointing, toy.
I wanted to only give it three stars, but my daughter wanted to give it four stars because she enjoys it despite the ramp issues.
She said, ""I use it more for a storyline rather than just for mindless rolling.""
(I suspect her Polly Pockets will eventually be brought in to play here.)
The bottom line is that, despite its shortcomings, kids will enjoy playing with this and it will hold up to a lot of play."
"I got this toy for my 20-months old.
He seem to enjoy it.
He has similar wooden car tumbling toy, so he knew what to do with this one.
The truck rolls down properly in about half of the times since the tracks are quite wobbly and move out of proper alignment.
The big brown piece of road fell of a few times, but it is easy to snap it back on.
My son spent a lot of time playing with the toy the last few days.
he is trying to figure out which of his cars will work here.
There is only one truck included with the toy, but there is only space for one vehicle that can be closed so it won't fall off when you fold the game and go, as its name suggests.I really like a lot of ""mechanical"" details on the toy (like stacks of tires etc), they are not functional, but they are fun to look at and touch and discuss.My main complain is the loud noise the toy makes, it activates when the truck starts rolling down and pushes on top piece of the road.
It is very loud and annoying, and you cannot turn it down, so we turned it off completely."
I gave this to my 2 year old nephew for his birthday and he LOVED it.
The best part of the whole toy is it's folding ability and ease of carrying.
He was going back home and folded it all up (himself) and carried it out!
The toy makes great sounds..talks and kept him busy for awhile.
The tumble action was fun and he laughed the whole time.
I am so happy I found this line because I can buy him more for his next gift-giving event.
Sturdy and compact it's great for travel.
"Overall this toy gets fours stars from me, and the main reason is that it's been so fun for our son and his cousin (almost two and almost three).
They enjoy sending the truck and other similar things down the ramp, which proves to entertain them for quite awhile.
The truck itself is a hit.
It is handy to be able to fold the ramps up, stow the truck in his spot and close the gate, and take the tower to another room or a friend's house.
The sound effects are only slightly annoying and easy to turn off as needed.
In my estimation it falls short of being outstanding enough to earn 5 stars, but it's what I hoped it would be.It's worth noting there are a few different sizes of Tonka Chuck and Friends vehicles.
The ones that work with this set are roughly 2 inches long.
One does come with the set, but it may be worth buying more eventually if the child doesn't already have some.I was concerned after seeing other reviews indicating that the truck doesn't make it down the ramp.
We haven't really found it to be a big problem on our set.
I can get it to work much more consistently than my toddler can, but that's not surprising and it doesn't seem to frustrate him.
The truck is top-heavy enough that it does sometimes turn flips on its way down and often gets stuck or derailed.
The blue ""elevator"" does need to be in just the right position so that takes a bit of tinkering.
My guess is that some of these towers work better than others.
I feel I must review the one we actually received, which works pretty well.
But a risk of getting one that didn't would make me think twice about buying a second one for a friend."
"My test subject for this toy was my 3 year old nephew, a boy well-versed in the operation of toy cars, trucks, firetrucks and construction vehicles.First off, the toy is very easy to assemble because the parts are basically all pre-attached.
The toy folds up nicely, making it a great toy to take along when going for a visit somewhere because you're not going to lose the parts in transit.The toy comes with the batteries included and preloaded, so no need to go searching for that small Phillips head screwdriver that's stuck in the junk drawer somewhere, or digging around for the spare AA batteries.
I appreciate any company that provides batteries with their toys because it allows for immediate playing gratification.My nephew was excited to receive a truck toy and I had to immediately open it up.
He was able to manipulate the game without problem, working the elevator, etc.
The problem came when he tried to let the included truck roll down the ramps from the top level.
The truck would always either get jammed or fall off the tower midway.
I looked closely at the toy, and it looks like it is a design flaw that is tripping up the smooth flow of the truck.
If the truck is started on the mid-level, the ramps would work as they were supposed to.
Needless to say, the whole toy palled rather quickly since it didn't work like it was supposed to.
He did later try his Hot Wheels/Matchbox cars on the tower and they did seem to run a little better - they still shot off the ramps midway, but sometimes they did actually stay on.
He also tried running some balls down the ramp but that didn't last.Since that first time that he played with it, I haven't seen him use it in the manner in which it was intended.
Instead, he now uses it as part of a ""wall"" that he constructs when he's building a castle or a fire station.
I can't really comment on the sound aspect of the game because he didn't play with it in the manner intended long enough for me to even learn what the sounds are, or to become annoyed by them.Perhaps this toy might be good for a younger child, one that is just learning how to place cars on ramps and can be entertained in that manner.
It's a cute toy, colorful and with moving parts that a younger child would like.
It's definitely a safe toy for younger children because there are no small parts that are loose.
But for a child of my nephew's age and toy experience, given the design problem with the toy, it's not something that I would recommend."
"I had high hopes for this toy.
My son (4.5 years old), loves all things vehicle.
I did not tell him this was coming, so opening the box from Amazon had him excited.He loved the toy from the moment he saw the package.
He ooh'ed and ahh'ed at the fact that he recognized ""Chuck"" and in fact, owns some of Chuck's friends.
It took my husband about 15 minutes to release the toy from the package.
There were several twist ties and plastic clips holding it in the box.Without reading the directions, which boys are sometimes known to do, my husband took 5 minutes to put the toy together and figure it out.
My son jumped right in.
He played with it for about 3 minutes before asking us ""what does this do?""
We showed him the elevator, the slide and did a few run throughs for him.
He then took over and failed to get the same flippy thing that Chuck does that we achieved.
My husband tried it again and Chuck flew out the from off a ramp.
It happened again and again.The slide fell off a few times, the elevator didn't stay on 'track' like I think it should for a plastic toy for boys.
After a good 10 minutes playing, my son closed it up and walked away.
He came back once or twice in the next week, but hasn't gone back to it yet.The pro of this toy is that is closes up into a nice flat box.
While Chuck fits into the elevator, he will fall out as a 4 year old boy carries it.
Even though the age is 18 months and up, I would rate this for more like 18 month (with help to operate) to 3 years.
This tower is very durable - it survives my 4 year old son on a daily basis.
I was suprised at how well the ramps stay on and the toy stays together through hours of rough play.
We had a similar type of a toy from a different manufacturer and the ramps constantly broke off.
Chuck rolls down the hill just about every day at our house and provides lots of entertainment.
We also use the ramp as a track for marbles.
Very durable and tough construction - just like you would expect from Tonka.
So the idea with the Tonka Chuck and Friends Fold and Go Tumble Tower is that you raise the truck with the hand crank and it tumbles down the ramps.
Problem is it doesn't work most of the time.
The truck seems too big or the ramps aren't well designed and it seems to get stuck most of the time.
That takes a big part of the fund away.
That's about it.
There's not much more to do with it and the voices getting annoying really quickly.
It's a toy with no educational value that barely works.
"You can gather most of what you need to know about this simple product from the photo that accompanies the description.
It's a plastic race toy that sends a small (but not safety-hazard small) plastic dump truck cascading down a switchback track of shifting ramps, eventually exiting at the bottom.
Pretty simple design with simple accompanying assembly (almost none).
It comes with one toy car, which upon opening, caused a two-year-old I know to immediately look through the box for more.
(He couldn't believe the toy came with only one car.
Upon consideration, I'd have to agree that he's got a point.)
If you should lose the included dump truck (as we did within a 1/2-hour), SOME matchbox cars will suffice, though many are too long and get hung up on their way down the ramps.The action of the toy takes place over the course of about 1.5 seconds, so depending on your child's attention span, it might have limited replay value.
My play tester's first session lasted a good 10 minutes, which seemed better than reasonable to me for a toy of this type.
Included are the requisite obnoxious kiddie cartoon voices and sound effects (PLEASE TOY MAKERS TAKE NOTE:  THESE ADD N-O-T-H-I-N-G TO PLAYTIME FUN!
), but mercifully there is an on/off switch.
This toy plays just as well (if not better) without the squealing voice spurting out, ""YAY!
LET'S GO!
"", etc...
There is also a red button on the front of the unit that activates the sounds.
You can hope your little one doesn't find it.The toy's purported ""Fold and Go"" features are an almost silly marketing-only feature.
The handle at the top is nice for the little ones to tote this around by themselves, but chances are good they won't ""fold"" the toy into storage mode effectively and might even undo the adult's efforts to do so.
My son loves the small Chuck trucks, and when I saw this, I knew he'd like it.
He has had a lot of fun playing with it, but it does have some problems.
The main one is that the cars and trucks do not consistently do the flip at the end, and either skid out sideways or get stuck in the last ramp.
Not as much fun as it looks on the package.The other issue is the volume...there is only one level: loud.
Yes, you can turn off completely, but there isn't a quieter option on this toy, unlike many toys with sounds.Even with these imperfections, my just turned 3 year old likes is, and still pulls it out to play with it about a month later.
"The best part of this tumble tower is the cute little truck that comes with it - both ""testers"" of the toy (2 yrs and a very young 7 months - not recommended  age) preferred to play ""freestyle"" with the truck than use the tumble tower - they lost interest in the ""tumbling"" very quickly.
The younger one actually liked the voice responses when he touched the tower - and was smiling with a 1000 Watt smile..and would intently watch along the older kid play with the truck...  (Luckily, there is a OFF button to power off the voice - but no volume control).
The highly repetitive and non-creative elements of the toy is not likely to sustain a kid's interest for long - encouraging freestyle play - mixing with other playsets, etc is a far better option to get value from this playset."
The first day, he played with it for a whole hour straight.
For the past 4 days, he keeps coming back to it.
For some reason, it fascinates him.Of course, Chuck the dump truck has been familiar to him since he was a baby.
He has it in three sizes plus talking models (in addition to most of Chuck's friends in various sizes).
This might be part of the appeal.
The particular Chuck in this toy is a little sturdier/heavier as opposed to the rubber and plastic that is common in this Tonka collection.
This gives it additional traction to speed down the ramp.
Of all the vehicles he's tried on it, this Chuck is among the best performers.The idea is to push Chuck up the brown ramp and onto the elevator; move the elevator up to the top level; slide Chuck onto the tumbling ramps; and watch him tumble until he reaches bottom and drives off from the blue ramp.
This is achieved with entertaining sound effects and the usual Chuck-talk.
But that's it.
This is the script and there's no variation.
The car can't enter through the blue ramp or take alternate routes.
There is nothing else to do but repeat the same sequence over and over.
This is the reason that I'm less fascinated with the toy than my grandson is.
I wish it would allow greater opportunities for imaginative play.On the plus side, it does require concentration and coordination for a 2 1/2 year old to follow this sequence and operate the elevator.
He takes that part of it very seriously since he loves elevators, especially the glass ones and immediately recognized what this was.
