Reviews:
"The first thing we noticed about this toy is that it feels sturdier than it looks in the photos.
It's got solid heft for a plastic toy, and even the most likely break point, the hinge connecting the light to the gun, seems strong.
It's also much darker in color than in the photos -- the colors are close to those of Robert Downey's suit from the movies.
There are two Velcro straps that wrap around the child's arm and one elastic strap that goes around the hand.
If you're an average-sized adult, it may or may not fit you (I'm 6' tall and can just barely get my arm into it).
Also note that the main photo in Amazon's listing shows the toy upside down -- the gun barrels are on the bottom, and the round light on the top.There are two functions to the toy: the gun and the lights & sounds.
The gun is a simple spring-loaded mechanism with two separate barrels.
There's a launch button for each barrel on the underside of the gun, which must be pressed using the off hand.
The hard plastic missiles fire at a good clip, so consider the maturity level of your child.
These are not Nerf darts.
(Some other reviewers appear to have discovered the hard way that there is a slight hazard here.)
Four missiles are included, with two handy storage clips on either side of the gun (four total).
They're fairly small, though, so you're likely to find them a year later under the sofa cushion.The other function consists of lights and sounds that activate when the user bends his hand back (to show the round light).
The light shines blue and some combination of a heroic statement and/ or sound effects play (""I'll deal with this!""
Pew pew pew!).
It's rather loud, and there is no volume control, but thankfully there is an on/ off switch to preserve the batteries (and the parents' sanity).
Fun and exciting and great for pretending you are in The Avengers or in Iron Man.
I wanted to play with it myself.
FYI: It's pretty sturdy when dropped.
"My 6 year old grandson eagerly opened this item by himself read the instructions and commenced shooting the little missiles all around the house.
Needless to say this created some chaos.
He seemed to enjoy the oddly shaped thing which straps on your wrist and makes some interesting sounds and announcements and also has flashiing lights.I did not care for the missiles shooting in the house, but he and his grandpa convinced me that they were not powerful enough to ""put your eye out"".
It really should be an outdoor toy but we worried the the little missiles  would get lost in the tall grass.
He played with the thing for about an hour and has never picked it up or asked about it on subsequent visits to our house.Overall as a grandparent I would be happy if he never played with it again.
I would also not send it to his house where it would create greater chaos than they already have with two little boys.
I guess it is fun for the kids but I did not enjoy having those missiles going off around my house."
"Of all the super heroes out there, my daughter thinks Iron Man is just the coolest.
Whenever we go shopping, the Iron Man mask is something she almost always tries on.
As soon as I saw this Tri-power Repulsor listed in the Vine newsletter, I clicked like a madman, trying to ensure that I got it for her.
We hadn't seen this in any stores, so it was one of those things that was going to be hit or miss.
Luckily, it's a big hit.
If your child pretends they're Iron Man or just likes things that shoot, this toy would make a great gift.
There are only a few tiny cons in my eyes, but you can't go wrong with something like this at the current price.
I mean, look at the now-smaller-than-they-used-to-be Hulk hands that go for around the same price.The Repulsor straps around the user's wrist with two velcro straps.
It's supposed to go under your forearm rather than on top, but you can use it that way too.
Slip your fingers through the loop at the end and you're good to go!
Bending your hand upward 'activates' the Repulsor, making the signature sounds and light kick in.
The Repulsor shoots two plastic darts from the cannons, one at a time, when you press the gold buttons above each cannon.
The darts shoot about 10 feet or so and shouldn't be too hard to find.
The other two darts that come with it can be stored on the side of the toy simply by snapping them in place.
The Repulsor also features a few voice clips like ""I am Iron Man!""
and ""Avengers assemble!"".
"If your youngster has seen Iron Man 2, it's a well known fact that this Tri-Power Repulsor fires those powerful power beams that are so strong they can dissolve matter.
Launch the missiles, hear the blast sounds, and see the pulse lights.
It fires four missiles, missiles that can be tucked on the side of the gun for storage.
You'll also hear (over and over) two phrases: ""I am Iron Man!""
and ""Avengers assemble.
""This is a great toy for a lot of good old fashioned, imaginative play.
This is part of Hasbro's ""Avengers"" line.
It's made of sturdy plastic and you'll soon find, as I have, you'll have a young Avenger raising his hand to launch those missiles.
If you want to add additional items to the set you can consider the Iron Man Deluxe Helmet and the Iron Man Arc Light.
For this Repulsor you'll want to have 3 AAA batteries on hand as they are not included in the package.The Tri-Power ""Avengers"" Repulsor is a fun, imaginative, role-play toy.
There are all kinds of role-playing toys out there, and the ones that are the most desirable to children come from movies they have seen.
This Repulsor originated with the Marvel comic series and then became ""real"" with the movie.
No, perhaps it's not educational, but is is fun.
If you have a youngster who's seen the movie, no doubt you'll have a few missiles flying your way!"
If you like shoot 'em up toys this one is for you.
It's somewhat durable, though I have a feeling than in a rough and tumble all out game of good vs. evil it probably won't hold up too well.
My 4 1/2 year old son loves this toy.
He is so into it that he now wants to get an Iron Man costume to go with it.
The toy's design is really cool.
It is a lot of fun to shoot the little darts out of it.
He was very thrilled to get this toy as a gift.
Lights and action work very well.
It fits very well on his arm as well.
Very satisfied.
Just in time for the Avengers movie comes a new wave of role-playing toys.
My son already has an Iron Man mask and Repulsor chest-piece, so he was thrilled to get this Tri-Power Repulsor, which features lights and sounds and fires missiles.The good - This is a pretty cool toy.
It fits easily on my son's arm, and isn't too heavy or bulky, and it looks neat too.
The phrases are pretty loud, but that's typical of most talking toys.
The missiles shoot pretty far, and aren't hard to load or fire.The bad - This is a minor gripe, but plastic missiles seem totally inappropriate for this kind of toy.
They'd make sense on an action figure or similar accessory, but this is a role playing toy.
Kids are going to want to shoot another person (a friend with the Captain America shield perhaps).
Nerf-style foam darts would have made a lot more sense.It's not perfect, but the Tri-Power Repulsor is a pretty cool accessory, and one that my young Avenger-in-training was very happy with.
As long as he's not shooting at other people, I can live with the hard plastic missiles.
"""The Avengers"" Iron Man Tri-power Repulsor is an upgraded version of a similar toy released along with the film ""Iron Man 2.""
My son has two of the repulsors from ""Iron Man 2,"" and when I saw this one available on the Amazon Vine list, I had to grab it for him.Having witnessed the older model in action, I have to admit that I really like this upgraded model.
For starters, the repulsor is a lot bulkier than the older model.
The design of the repulsor is different as well, allow for all four missiles to be stored on the sides of the repulsor itself.
On the older model, two projectiles could be stored in the backside of the repulsor.Another improvement is the firing pins for the missiles.
They were flush in the older model and somewhat hard to see.
In this model, the pins are a bit more noticeable and a different color from the piece of the the repulsor they are set within.As with the older model, children need to flip their wrists up in order to make the repulsor light up and make noises.
Along with the standard repulsor ""blast"" sound, a few other noises and a voice declaring ""I am Iron Man"" and other phrases has been added.Overall, I enjoy this model much more than the one released for ""Iron Man 2.""
It feels sturdier, looks cooler, and has made my son fall in love with Iron Man all over again."
My 7 year old does like it.
He is a big ironman fan.
He plays with it on a regular basis.
Overall good fun and durable toy.
"My 5 year old has the original repluser that came out around the time of Iron Man 2.
Its lasted a long time and has taken some abuse so I was excitied when they released the updated Avengers version of the repulser for him to try.
There are a few things that make this version a bit better than the original but is very close to being identical as well.First, the overall design is slightly different but the the way it functions is the same.
To get the replusler to light up and the voice to engage you simply move the repluser up or down with your hand.
Once of the better improvements in this model is the tightness of the action.
the original one was very loose which made it flop back and forth very easily.
This one seems to have slightly tighter movements so it won't go off ever time its picked up.Another improvement is with the straps that are used to wrap around your hand.
This one has 3 straps which can be made tighter than the original and the top strap (by the repluser) is a tight elestic style which makes it easier for kids (or adults with small hands) to manuever the repluser up and down.There are two main drawbacks to this version.
First, the voice is this version has been changed from the original.
The Iron Man 2 toys all seemed to use the same style and sound voice but this one uses one that is less ""mechanical"" sounding.
I think I;d be Ok with it but my 5 year old seemed a little bothered by it like it wasn't the real Iron man.
LOL!The other drawback to this is that it does not come with a glove.
the original had a small red glove that kids can put on to help complte the Iron man look.
Not sure why they did not include it in this version but it is one less thing that you get.Overall, its a nice update to the original model.
My 5 year old has told me he likes both of them equally so from his stadpoint, one is not better than the other."
I got this toy for my daughter who is a big fan of the Avengers.
She enjoys it, and it seems to do everything it claims to do.
Nothing overly fancy here - it makes a few different sounds, lights up and shoots two darts a decent distance.
It comes with four darts total but only two can be loaded at one time.
The extra two are nice to have since these things are lost easily (in my household, at least).
If you have a 6-11 year old who is a big fan of the movie, they may enjoy this toy.
This is a attractive looking Iron man repulsor.
The repulsor I received looks much more realistic than the red and yellow photo on the product's Amazon.com page (the color of the repulsor is crimson and the accents are bronze, which looks much more like Iron Man's actual armor).
The blue repulsor works nice, and the toy fits securely with straps on a child's arm.
The toy is small, but will fit an average sized child's arm in the 4-9 range.
The toy also includes an audio voice of Iron Man, but I thought it would have been really cool if they had used Robert Downey Jr.'s voice (the actor who played Iron man in the films) instead.Overall the toy is fun and looks relatively durable, but larger foam/nerf like missiles would have been ideal.
The repulsor comes with small blue plastic missiles, which could end up in a child's eye or even being swallowed.
The toy is marketed for children aged 4 years and older, but I would definitely not give this missile launching toy to a four year old.
My son is six, and I would feel comfortable with him using it as long as me or my wife supervised him due to the plastic missiles shooting out.
Overall a nice toy, but I feel there are some safety concerns with the plastic missiles, especially with younger children.
"My 6 year old got this for his birthday and my 8 year old wants one now.
Their younger sister was interested but much less so.
It works as promised and is more durable than I expected.
The whole thing straps onto the forearm with 2 velco straps.
It is made in China.It is basically a 2-barrel missile launcher that fires small plastic missiles 6 feet straight up or up to about 20 feet.
They have small rounded tips so don't really hurt but you can feel them close up.
There are 4 included missiles that must be individually loaded into the front of the 2 launchers.
There are 2 buttons on the bottom of the launcher to fire the missiles - you need to use your other hand to press them.
The missiles can clip into the sides of the unit for storage.While the launder works without batteries, the sound effects and light need 3 AAA batteries (not included).
The light has a strap on the back which you hold onto and turn to make the light (and sound effects) come on.
Sometimes it talks, sometimes just sound.
The boys like activating the light in a dark room, but it is visible in daylight.
With batteries, you also get a shooting sound effect when firing a missile.I couldn't find replacement missiles.
It is nice that 4 are included so can still be ""fully loaded"" even after losing 2."
"Yes, it is an Iron Man branded product and it seems really cool.
It's marketed for little boys and the marketing department does a great job of roping them in.
The reality of this product is that it attaches to their wrist/forearm upside down and your hand/palm is around the 'light' part.
It has sounds, lights and all the bells and whistles.
Great for children... not so much for adults.The reason this toy was rated 3 stars is because the missiles that come with this product are just too hard/rigid!
When you shoot them off of a wall or door you can hear the hard 'ping'.
That was my first inclination that the missiles might hurt.
The next sentence out of my mouth was, ""Don't shoot it at anyone!""
Being 5 years old the next thing that he did was decide to shoot them at his Father that was sitting on the couch watching television.
The loud scream of agony was heard across the apartment...
I run in and he is clutching his head covering his eye.
One of the missiles landed in his eye.
It took a trip to ophthalmologist and 4 days to heal!
My husband does not like this toy and I can understand why.
Kids should not shoot any toys at one another, but then again we can't control what they do; especially when it is a toy that is going to shoot 'missiles'.
Btw, our son stopped playing with it after the first day because two of the missiles went missing.
I loaded this thing and gave it to my 3 year old daughter and she has been having non stop fun with it.
She really does not understand what Avengers are, but using this as a dart shooter.
(1) Load it with 3 AAA batteries (not included)(2) Wear it on your hands, strap them on, additionally strap on the red round thing to your palm(3) Load the ammo 2 hard plastic darts with rounded ends(2 spare provided that can be stowed away on the sides)(4) if you want to shoot the darts, press either of the 2 buttons on the sides- This is not very convenient, you have to use another hand to press the buttons(BTW, the dart shooter does not need the batteries, works on spring action)And the darts typically travel about 3-4 feet before tapering downwards(5) The only sound/light is from the unit when you bend/flip down the red round thing downwardswhich is strapped to your palmFor the safety aspects, this does not seem like a very safe thing, the hard plastic darts can hurt a kids eyes.
I will let my daughter play with this for another day, after which this thing goes to the garage attic.The reason why I rated this product 3 stars are :(1) Safety aspect is low - should have come with foam darts(2) Very limited light/sounds(3) Poor design with the strap on
