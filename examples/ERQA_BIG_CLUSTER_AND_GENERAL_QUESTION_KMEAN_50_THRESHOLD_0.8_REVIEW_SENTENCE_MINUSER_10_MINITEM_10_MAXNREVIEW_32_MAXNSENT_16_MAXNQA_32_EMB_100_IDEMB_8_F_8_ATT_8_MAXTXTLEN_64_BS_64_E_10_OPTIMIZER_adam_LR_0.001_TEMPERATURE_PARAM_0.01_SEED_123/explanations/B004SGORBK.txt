Top sentence(s):
We have a large storage bin of his G.I.
I did not have GI Joes as a kid, so I can't really compare them to the original.
Joes ever and, ammo or no ammo, he comes with a working parachute and it's suitable for children 5 or older.
We have a very high ceiling big room in the building, and I've had 35 year old men run off with it to play.
I made sure he kept a little plastic bag for all the little pieces I knew he would take apart so they wouldn't end up in the vacuum cleaner.

Wherever there is injustice, you will find us.Wherever there is suffering, we'll be there.Wherever liberty is threatened, you will find...[the G.I.
Joe Ultimate 12 Inch Paratrooper]Or not.
It depends on how far you can throw because throw G.I.
Joe you will.
Get this Joe IF you want to see him leaping into action, silently dropping on evil-doers when least expected and a lot more accurate and less expensive than the cool drones that are his main competition these days.This G.I.
Joe is superbly trained and fully equipped to accomplish his missions.
Besides his parachute [CHOCKING HAZARD-Small parts.
Not for children under 3 years] this soldier deemed to be suitable for boys and girls ages 5+ comes with the following:- Helmet and goggles (check)- Modern military uniform (check)- Poseable fingers (check - it means he can hold the knife or the pistol or the rifle)- Tactical assault rifle (check)- Combat knife (check)- Pistol (check)- Jump pack (check - the parachute, that is)- Binoculars (check - with night vision, I hope)- Flashlight (check - I guess no night vision, possibly due to budget cuts)- Ammo (hmmm... no ammo - more budget cuts or... maybe the ammo funds went to the drones?
- but he's got a knife and poseable fingers and he is superbly trained)This is one of the most feature-loaded G.I.
Joes ever and, ammo or no ammo, he comes with a working parachute and it's suitable for children 5 or older.
I will take away one star for it lacking night vision, ammo and some minimal communication gear.
My son is flanked by 2 sisters in age, so he'll get roped into playing with their dolls.
GI Joe was a good addition -- the right size and detail.
I made sure he kept a little plastic bag for all the little pieces I knew he would take apart so they wouldn't end up in the vacuum cleaner.
He was able to put on and take everything off everything except for the parachute which I helped him with (which is good so I could be the one to put it back on).
The parachute was novel for the first day but having to throw him in the house (as opposed to dropping) made for some getting yelled at for hitting things in the house.
He still talks of bringing GI Joe out for the spring/summer to toss around.
The girls like to use him as well to beat up the bad guys.
Not too bad for a toy soldier!
It is a lot of fun launching him, and I'm certain if I were younger I'd be able to think of a lot of cool places to launch him from.
As it was, I was out in my backyard trying to get more air from the top of a ladder....WHICH IS NOT RECOMMENDED!!!
This toy would be best purchased in a pair, and used in at least a group of two play.
Singular play is okay with an imaginative youngster who enjoys inner dialog role play.Fair warning, he floats down at the same rate as an actual human in a parachute, so don't expect any physics defying feats.
"First, this thing is big.
12 inches, are you kiddin' me?!
That's nothing that a first grader would be able thrust in the air very far.
And who always has a staircase handy, especially outside?
Exactly.It comes with all kinds of cool gear attached, and quite frankly the whole ""doll"" looks very much like the real thing.
It seems to be relatively sturdy, too, and the production quality is certainly very good also.Is it fun to play with it?
You bet.
But it takes some mechanic skills, hand-eye coordination and strength to achieve good results when throwing Mr. Joe in the air.
Plus, to make the parachute ready for the next launch, it sometimes requires some patience and also a skill-set that a five year old usually doesn't have yet.In my view, and reading the other reviews here, it is more a toy suited for adults (who are not afraid to let their inner child out once in a while) than for children.
For the age group of the 5-12 year old, who would probably actually have fun to play with it, it might be a bit too big.
For the age group of 13-19 it is probably not as interesting as the newest electronic gadget.
So, I guess the real target group for this toy might be men between 30 and 50 ... :)"
My oldest son is 14.
He was a G.I.
Joe fanatic when he was young.
We have a large storage bin of his G.I.
Joe soldiers and accessories.
There was a similar G.I.
Joe Paratrooper that was sold about 10-11 years ago.
Back then there was always a variety of the larger men to choose from.
I haven't found this to be the case in the past few years.
I've been searching for similar toys for my 4 & 6-year-old sons but haven't been able to find them.
It's nice to see their return.The larger G.I.
Joe soldiers are finally back on the shelves.
This paratrooper is even cooler than the one we bought a decade ago.
This newer version does not have a removable parachute as did our original one.
This is both a good and bad thing.
As expected with little boys, the parachute gets taken off and lost.
We have had a lot of fun with this GI Joe action figure.
We do not see this as a collector item, although you could buy it for that reason.
We decided to just enjoy it for what it was.The toy build is pretty high quality.
The parachute does slow his descent, although in our two story house you can't tell much.
The instructions explain how you should toss him in the air.
But I don't think any child (or even a lot of adults) can throw him high enough for that to really matter.
I would give up on that idea.
But if you are in a high place and drop him its really cool.He has a lot of small accessories, like binoculars and a pistol, which will probably get lost.He is really durable and survives it all.A really nice quality toy.
We enjoy it.
I remember when my brother and I was little we used to get the cheap plastic paratroopers and play with them all day long.
Now my nephew gets to enjoy the ultimate paratrooper when he comes to visit and he loves it.
My brother, who is my nephew's father, is in the Army so my nephew loves that this is an Army paratrooper.
This toy comes with all the bells and whistles some including an opening parachute, army outfit, goggles, helmet, bag, combat knife, and assault riffle.
Granted the accessories are a little cheap but not many people buy this toy for the accessories anyway.
Also the fingers are posable and the parachute had opened everytime we have thrown it so far.
I would recommend this product for ages 6 and up though due to the type of accessories (guns & knife) and it takes a throwing arm for the parachute to open.
I do not think a 4 year old could get the parachute to open on their own.
This GI Joe is well worth the money.
I am impressed.
This GI Joe is extremely well made.
He can stand up to the rough play that kids put him through.
Within minutes of being out of the box, my kids were throwing him off the porch to see how far her could parachute.
They were very entertained.
I did not have GI Joes as a kid, so I can't really compare them to the original.
There are a lot of small parts, so they aren't kidding on the 5 and up age thing.
(Although, my 4 year old is okay with him, but he is pretty mature with toys and isn't a chewer.)
He has a flashlight, pistol, rifle, knife, belt, holster, goggles, backpack, other random baggage (I'm not hip on the army terms for such things), helmet, and boots- that all come off.
Some of the parts are too small for the kids to work themselves (particularly hooking the knife onto the belt).
Their kid fingers just can't seem to work those tiny buttons and clips.
It is hard for me to do it!
(I seriously thought we were going to have to break out the tweezers for that blasted knife.)
Despite that, they love GI Joe.
He is extremely well built and very detailed.
I ordered this toy for my nephew who is five.
He loooovvveeeesssss it!
It has all kinds of neat stuff that comes with it, the gun and other weapons.
The details of the toy work well.
For example, the trigger finger moves.
His parents quickly got a baggie to put all of Joe's stuff into so that they could keep track of it.
It works when you throw it in the air.
You do need to have a lot of room for it and in a lot of houses, it would probably be better to take it outside.Given a 5-year-old boy will be plalying with it, we'll see how long it lasts.
But, it seems to be well constructed and he'll have fun with it for as long as it holds up and/or he keeps track of all the pieces that come with the action figure.
This GI Joe Army Paratrooper offers a lot of imaginative play options but please note that it does come with small parts.
The box recommends ages 5 and up as the target age and I have to agree with that suggestion after helping my 6 year old attach the parachute to the figure.
The buckle is too small for his fingers to manipulate properly and the parachute bag's straps have to be inserted through the parachute loops.
Also, keep in mind that you may be helping to pack and unpack the parachute for your child if they are not able to do it themselves.
My son has big hands and big fingers for his age that just make these tasks difficult for him at this stage in the game.
This does not diminish the fun factor for him but I know that I will be called upon when the paratrooper is on active duty.
When my husband is home he likes to get involved as he was a huge GI Joe collector as a child.
He was impressed by the poseable fingers and many included accessories.
This action figure is a good choice to encourage imaginative play for your growing child.
"Considering that he is made more for the shelf than the sky this 12"" G.I.
Joe paratrooper lands and soars amazingly well with his huge and realistic parachute.
The instructions say to throw about 15 feet high at angle to get the chute to open, but I was able to really chuck him straight up much higher and when the chute opened right he landed knees and feet first with bent legs.
The weight is just enough for the chute to carry but I left off the jump pack which might be realistic but is really just a heavy piece of plastic that ensures he lands feet forwards.
The other accessories are spot on and fun to put into his well articulated kung fu grip hands.
The knife, flashlight, .45, helmet and goggles all have places that fit realistically into his gear, the binos however are too small for scale and kind of look sily.
The figure stands well for display without a base and can be posed into many action stances.
This elite jumper is more fun than the average Joe thanks to the parachute which tucks away nicely into it's backpack.
The clothing and chute pack are well made and can stand up to some play, snaps will come loose though eventually if overused and after enough jumps other things could get worn out articulation etc..  Great fun on display or in the air."
"I thought I'd keep this around for my 7 year old nephew who visits often, and for the age 7&9 kids who live down the hall.They all did get a chance to play with Joe, and with many of the issues described by other reviewers, everyone did get Joe to sail.
You absolutely do have to follow the instructions on tossing him into the air at an angle.
When just letting him drop, the chute fails.
The dynamics seem more like those of a kite.
It would have been more ""realistic"" if the parachute worked from a standard fall  (Soldiers don't really throw themselves up out of an airplane, do they ...).That said, I brought Joe into work as a desk toy, and my geeky coworkers (I work for a tech/internet company) play with this more than the kids did.
It's a great desk toy and conversation piece.
Nostalgia too.
We have a very high ceiling big room in the building, and I've had 35 year old men run off with it to play.
It's a fun toy."
My 6 year old son was very excited to receive this GI Joe.
I discovered we have slightly different opinions of it, so I'll provide both and you can decide which appeals to you.HIS:  -Excited to get it, tore it open, and played with for almost an hour straight.-'Really neat' toy to shoot his other 'bad guy' toys-Love the guns, accessories, and parachute-Have trouble getting him to 'fly' but not sure why.
I'll ask Dad.
:o)MINE: -Appears moderately well made and durable-Parachute cords tangle frequently-Very difficult for a 6 year old to throw really high, let along factory recommended age 4+-I'm the one having to throw it since he can't.
So if I'm not there, Joe doesn't fly.I like this toy, but I would not recommend it for at least 7+ unless you have a tree house or the parent is willing to constantly throw it to get the parachute to function.
Not a big deal, but something people should know in advance.
As someone in sort of a step-parent role to two children I've found that far too many toys create more work for parents.
I simply don't understand this concept.
Toys should be about a child making discoveries on their own, empowering them, energizing their creativity.The primary problem here is the recommended age for this toy.I gave this to a six year old and quickly discovered that this toy is more work for me.
One, the parachute is easily tangled.
In some cases the chute must be removed entirely from the toy.
This is not something a small child can do on their own.
Two, to fully take advantage of the parachute function you really need an adult's assistance.
A small child simply cannot throw this toy high enough into the air to get it to float down.
Instead of it lands with a thud because it didn't get enough height.
And three, all the small parts that come with the toy fall off rather easily when you're throwing it around.
Lost pieces .
.
.
more work for me having to look for them!I'm guessing the minimum age for this toy - for the sanity of a busy parent - is probably around 8.
If you don't mind constantly fixing toys for your kids then have at it for younger ages.My other criticism will go over like a lead balloon.
I'm a former US Army solider.
"If I based this review soley on how much my 6 yr old son enjoyed this, it would get five stars, but there are a few problems that people should know about in advance...1) Don't follow the instructions in regards to using the parachute.
It's better not to fold it up so much, or it won't open so easily, although it is made from real parachute material.
It's an aboslute pain to try and repack the chute after using it.2) Our deck is much higher than the recommended 15 ft, but this guy dropped like a stone on our first attempt.
The height wasn't enough -- we still had to throw him up in the air several feet to give the chute enough time to open.
Once we figured that out, the chute worked fantastic, BUT...3) If you try to use the chute with his gear on -- even the realistic dog tags -- his stuff goes flying everywhere.
Also, regardless of how you bend his flexible legs, this guy looks like a train wreck after he hits the ground.
However, my son though it was hysterical to see his gear fly everywhere, and GI JOE looking like he couldn't crawl his way to safety.4) The gear is fabulously detailed, but I think most kids under 8 yrs old are going to have trouble getting various items attached to GI JOE.
Even I had problems with some of the tiny snaps, and one of the fasteners for his pack wasn't working right from the moment we took him out of the box.
(We tried out all the gear before we started throwing him off our deck.
)My son could care less about the broken fastener, or the difficulty of attaching the gear.
He thought this guy was ""freakin' awesome.""
While he had fun throwing him off our deck, he had the most fun just playing with the guy -- he loved how movable the arms, legs and hands were (yes!
GI JOE has posable trigger fingers).
In the end, all that matters is that my son thinks this toy is fantastic, even with the little problems."
