And so it is with the new Crayola Doodle Magic Color Mat.I love the mat concept.
How you use this is up to the imaginationGreat to hang on a door for a white board &#34;easel&#34; -- or --on the floor as a coloring or activity matIt is a great activity for rainy days
If I were Crayola I'd be embarrassed to have my name on this product.
Update November 21, 2013: I called Crayola today.
This product seemed like a great idea to me---a plastic floor mat that you could color on with Color Magic markers.

Reviews:
Update November 21, 2013: I called Crayola today.
Please keep in mind that they close at 4PM EST.
Might be a little harder for the people on the west coast.
I spoke to a Bridgette who has very friendly.
She asked if I could give her the UPC code.
However, the UPC code was covered with three stickers from Amazon and each one I pulled off pulled off the number she needed.
She then asked if I had the instructions.
I did!
They will ask you to read a number off of your instructions if your UPC code is not readable.
It took a few minutes, she was very nice, and they are sending new markers.
I will update when I receive them.My daughter and I were both very disappointed that so many other reviews were correct about the markers' colors being too faint.
The mat itself is very well designed and high quality, something I expected from Crayola and its parent company, Hallmark.
The loops on the mat to hold the markers work well and are easy to use.
The 2' x 3' mat rolls up easily for storage.
Of the four included markers, only the green one was visible and even it was not dark enough.
The yellow was totally invisible!I sincerely hope that Crayola can improve the markers, add fine and thicker options for the lines they make (like the options for permanent markers), and also provide more colors.
We received this today and my granddaughter, who was home sick from school, immediately grabbed it and spread it out on the floor.
She also looked at the box and asked it I wanted to hang it on her door - I didn't - so she colored on the floor.Sadly, the pens that come with it are way too light to make any type of a good picture.
I'm not certain if they were dried out or simply run very light, but both of us were very disappointed with the results.
Adding to the problem, one of the loops that was supposed to hold the crayons in place was broken loose before it arrived.It is a very cute idea - just a white mat that can be used to color - but implementation leaves much to be desired.
I suggest just getting your kids crayons and paper ... they will have a lot more fun, have better colors, and you can keep the pictures afterwards.A disappointing idea from Crayola.
"If Crayola had just tested this one a bit more it would be great.
But these days the name Crayola has turned into more about packaging and less about quality.
You would think if there was one thing in this set that WOULD work great, it would be the markers, right?
How did they get everything right except the markers?
!The mat is large and designed to hold up to use and abuse from kids.
There are nylon loops on the sides that hold the markers so you can keep everything together and rolled up when not in use.
When all rolled up, there'e even a carrying handle on the top so kids can take it along with them places.
It's a great idea and perfect for keeping at grandma's house, aunties apartment or anywhere else that the kids may show up and need something to play with for a little while.The problem lies in the markers.
Crayola says they are ""lighter"" to make erasing easier.
Yes, this is true.
They are lighter.
As the color from the marker sits on the mat, it does get a little darker, but not much.
It's just so light it looks like you're coloring with some kind of watered down pastel water-color paints.
The fix?
Pick up someKids Dry-Erase Markers in Assorted Colorsand keep them with the mat instead of the ones that come with it."
This mat provides a lot of function and a really cute presentation.
Unfortunately, it is very obvious that you will be engaging in a Vegas level game of chance when it comes to whether or not your markers will actually work with your mat.If you get lucky and get great markers, then you will have a really nice set with a roll up mat that reduces to basically the footprint of a yoga mat (although not quiet as thick).
When your eraser solution runs out, it is no big deal as you can wipe off the markers with the included towel.
This is good because the eraser solution goes fast unless it is more effective on the quality markers than it was on my weakly colored ones.
To erase a couple of words used a good 15 to 20% of the solution.Bottom line: if you get good markers, this is a nice set and a good value.
Otherwise, you will need to call and wait for replacement markers which rules this out as the ideal gift.
While this is a really great idea because you can take it pretty much everywhere without worry of stains, the markers BARELY show up at all.
Te color you see with your eyes on te mat is NOT what is shown on the box.
So while it may be a great idea it needs some work.
When I got this mat, I didn't realize it was basically the same thing as the Doodle Magic Lap Desk, which I hated!
Thankfully, we like this one a little better.With this mat, at least **magic erasers work**!
Let me be clear, though, that I am NOT referring to the eraser that is included with the mat.
It will erase the special included markers just fine, but not other markers.
The included markers still don't show up worth anything.
Before I knew it, my boys had already marked on this mat with other markers and crayons.
On the lap desk, the magic erasers wouldn't even work to remove those marks.
This mat is made of a softer, different material, though, and the magic eraser WILL remove markings from things other than the special markers included.
To me, that's great news, because other markers show up so much better.
My boys just don't have fun when they can't even see what they've drawn.The mat itself it pretty nice!
There's a loop at the top, so that you can hang it on the wall, you can just lay it on the floor or table.
There's also a little storage bag attached on the back to store art supplies.
There's also a little net bag on the front, along with a few loops to hold markers, too.
I really like the mat, and my children have had fun with it.
The minute this product came through the door, my nine-year-old and four-year-old couldn't wait to get their hands on it.
They immediately took out the markers and erasers and started drawing, to disappointing results.
From the picture, it looks like the marker colors are vivid and bold, and if this were the case, I have no doubt my kids would have loved this toy and gotten hours of play out of it.
The truth is, though, that the colors are barely visible.
Of the four, only the yellow is remotely visible, and it's very faint at best.Thinking my kids were doing something wrong, I had a go at the toy.
I erased what they'd drawn, wiped the mat dry with the included microfiber cloth, and gave each color a go, only to find that none of them really worked.
As noted, the yellow was faint, but the other three colors looked like nothing more than wet lines on the surface of the mat, completely colorless.It's bad enough to market something that works poorly at best, but inexcusable to sell a product that doesn't work at all.
Don't waste your money.
This is a brilliant idea to keep your budding artist busy.
Perfect for the rainy day box when you are stuck indoors on a weekend.The bad part of it is the markers are terrible.
I found that my erasable ones I use for work are much better.Hopefully Crayola fixes this issue.
Otherwise it would be a 5 star product.
I got this item for my 2 and 5 year olds.
Both really enjoy it.
I wish it were compatible with other Crayola markers like the Color Magic, but it's not -- I checked.
Also the marker colors are dull -- they aren't nearly as bright as shown on the box.
However, the clean up is quick, the surface large.
And I love how there is a spot for the markers and all needed items.
Then it rolls into a small tube shape, perfect for taking with you.
All in all, this is a winner with my kids.
I like that the mat is a soft surface for the kids to draw on.
It has a handle so that you can hang it on a door if the child prefers to draw while standing.
It rolls up and I easily stored.
This would have been a fantastic item except for the fact that the markers included with this mat are so faint that the drawings are hard to see.
I suppose you could use dry-erase markers with this but I would only do that with older children who could do a better job of preventing the markers and drawings from coming in contact with their clothes.
As the parent of 3 young children, I love the idea of this product - a creative and mess free outlet for my little ones.
However, there is a major issue with this product - the markers barely show up on the mat.
There are no vibrant colors like on the box.
My kids were really disappointed and lost interest because they could barely see what they were drawing.Yes the product erases easily, folds compactly and isn't messy but it also fails to do the main thing it was supposed to do - color.
I would not recommend this product.
I don't know what's up with Crayola.
I grew up loving Crayola.
They were the premier brand in crayons.
I didn't want cheap or off-brand crayons, I wanted Crayolas.
I liked the vibrancy of the colors, the color names printed right on the crayons and they were just the best quality.
Crayola crayons didn't break easy and wasn't waxy.In the past years though, Crayola has tried to be creative and come out with more and more products.
They have moved way past being just crayons.
It seems more often than not, the products aren't that great of quality.
Many Crayola products consistently get low reviews.The idea of all the products are good but it's the execution that fails.
And so it is with the new Crayola Doodle Magic Color Mat.I love the mat concept.
Just roll out the mat or hang it up and you have an on-the-go art project or one that can easily be rolled back up and out of the way when not in use.
No wasting papers, just a mat that can be drawn on, wiped off and used over and over again.The problem is the markers.
Once again, it seems like another Crayola product that has been designed, developed and never tested.
On the front of the box, you see these beautiful colors but in actuality, the colors are so light and faint that you can barely tell what color is which.The mat is such a nice quality and so large that I'm taking the advice of some other reviews and get some dry erase markers to use.Would be a great product if they improved the markers.
This Crayola Doodle Magic mat and Doodle Magic markers are admittedly a marvelous concept.
A mat that doubles as a canvas for young artists and a carrying case.
The mat is very sturdy, has a built-in area for supply storage, and the coloring surface can easily be wiped clean.
Unfortunately, the Doodle Magic markers have done a disappearing act.
We tried all four of them (why not more colors?)
and was quite surprised when there were only faint markings when bright, vivid lines were expected.
I swiped my finger across these lines and they came up readily and didn&#8217;t even absorb into my skin.FEATURES:&#9658; Coloring mat features an easy-to-use, roll-out design&#9658;  Pick colors, doodle and erase&#9658;  Colors instantly erase from the surface with just one swipe&#9658;  Included hang loop to hang coloring mat on wall or door&#9658;  Includes storage for markers, eraser and cloth&#9658;  Marker and drawing surface system has a large 2&#8217; x 3&#8217; surface&#9658;  Includes: one coloring mat, one color eraser, one wipe cloth, four Doodle Magic markers (purple, orange, green, yellow)Yes, if you haveCrayola Dry Erase Markerson hand, they do work with this mat, however, the Doodle Magic Mat is being sold with the premise that the Doodle Magic markers are fully functioning.
Crayola will make good on the markers, but the Doodle Magic kit is simply no good without them.

This is such a great concept and such a great package, it just fails to work very well.We have a Aqua Doodle which got a fair amount of use.
The matt is pretty flimsy, doesn't roll up well, and there isn't a great place for the pen (ours is the standard version, there may be a more deluxe version).
This Crayola mat is thick, feels of substantial quality, has storage pockets, etc.
However the colors are incredibly dim, and take too long to show up.
Kids lost interest quite fast.
Wish it worked better, as this is a great product otherwise.
I have two children, a six-year-old and a 21-month old, so it is not often that I find toys that can span both of their ages.
However, this Crayola Doodle Mat does just that.
The nice thing about it is that it allows my older daughter to use colors while keeping my little boy from grabbing her markers and running off through the house drawing on whatever he wills because the pens only work on the mat.I also like that it has little rubber bands attached to the mat to keep everything together, and that you can roll it up and stick it in a corner of the closet when you are done with it.Really there is nothing I dislike about this product.UPDATE: Two months later, and the markers do not work on this product!
I ended up throwing it away even though the markers had been closed up because they would not make any marks on the mat.
"I'll join the chorus here and agree that the color saturation generated by the pens in this otherwise very solidly built drawing mat is much much too dim.
I don't know where and how Crayola was able to generate the artwork for the box and instructions, but it most certainly was not by the normal use of the actual product which is barely visible.
It boggles the mind that they are actually releasing this product.
My daughter recommends ""zero stars"" but I'll be merciful because it doesn't burst into flame and give it a 2."
"I wouldn't purchase this set.
The markers do not show up at all and stink really strongly of chemicals.
I didn't even feel comfortable letting my son play with it.
He got down on the floor and started to color then cried because the markers were ""broken"".
Here is the fix!
Get out your crayola washable markers and use those.
They write on the map and wipe cleanly afterwards, best of all- they actually show up.So while I wouldn't buy this set as half of it is flawed, i will say that the mat is nice to have as long as you have washable crayola markers to use on it."
it simply doesn't work.
The markers give off a clear ink, that has a slight tint.It seemed like a good idea but is completely unusable.
I thought that this was going to be a great for the kids.
But with this product there is a few flaws.
The colors are not bold and bright.
They show up really dull.
You have to keep coloring for the colors to show up .I do like that it folds up very easy and can be used on the go.
My little ones 2 years old really did enjoy this.
But the 6 year old rather draw on paper.
wipes up easy and no mess.
How you use this is up to the imaginationGreat to hang on a door for a white board &#34;easel&#34; -- or --on the floor as a coloring or activity matIt is a great activity for rainy days
My kids were very disappointed when we began playing with this color mat.
The orange and green markers are very faint and don't show up as colors they more or less look greyish.
The yellow and purple/pink are faint but look like the correct colors, the eraser works fine, but the colors aren't dark so I can't imagine they would be too hard to remove.
I was hoping that once the markers were used more they would darken in shade but so far we have had no such luck.
A company like Crayola should be held accountable for their products.
I mean surely there's quality control, people who test their products and decide whether it's ready for the market.
This item fails so badly, that it says a lot about their company.Like everyone else has already stated, the markers don't work, like for real!
You see on the box a bright colorful picture the kids have drawn and you know that no way did they do that with the markers from this set.
And to add insult, Crayola specifically states in the manual that the Mat can only be used with the Magic Doodle Markers included with this set, and no other Crayola product.
For real?The Magic Doodle Pens magically disappeared (in the trash) and I replaced them with various Crayola washable markers.
Works perfect!
The mat wipes clean like a dry erase board and the kids really enjoyed coloring on it.
I don't recommend anything other than washable markers because even if they do work on the mat, they won't come off your kid.That being said, I was able to salvage this mat.
The kit comes with a sort of eraser (a sponge with water on a stick) and a little drying towel.
Those items work great.
The mat itself reminded me of a large changing pad, which I was considering using that way if I couldn't get the markers to work.
The mat is quite sizable and can be played with on the floor or somehow hung on a wall with the velcro attachments.Another issue I had with the mat was the ability to fold it!
My goodness, why did they make this so difficult?
There's not any directions on how to do this in the manual.
I mean, you'd think it would be easy, but it's not because the handle is on one side, and the velcro is on the other, and somehow you've got to line them up --blah.In the end I am able to use this mat quite well, but not without breaking some Crayola rules.
When my daughter had a playdate, I brought out the Doodle Magic.
The seven and nine year-olds were initially excited, but it was an immediate flop.
The colors come out so faint, the kids can barely make it out.
I'm not sure if the markers were too dry or if that's how it's supposed to turn out, but they stopped playing after the first few strokes of each marker.
All of them gave it one star.___________________________UPDATE 12/7/13: As suggested by others, I called Crayola, and they happily sent me a new pack of markers.
These markers are visibly different than the first set and they do work.
We can see the colors!
The only problem I have now is wondering how long the eraser will last.
It takes a lot of strokes to erase a few lines.I like the storage pocket for the markers and I like the straps for carrying and storage.
If they ship with the new markers, it's not a bad toy.
"I had high hopes for this because my sister's kids had the Aquadoodle mat and this, I thought, was basically the same thing...NOT!!!
I was extremely let down by Crayola's poor quality product.
I'll start by saying the one positive thing I can say is that I liked the carrying handle and the bands inside to hold the markers and the drawing surface is large, but that doesn't matter considering that you can't even see what you're drawing because the markers are so light (unlike the bright colors shown on the box = false advertisement) it's basically like invisible ink!
Of the four markers included, the yellow and orange are the worst and don't even show up!
The green comes out looking gray and the purple comes out a very very light pink.Yet another issue with this piece of junk is that if your child so much as touches the ink on the mat, it smudges off the mat and all over their hands.
Also, if you leave the ""color,"" if you can call it that, on the mat too long (about an hour), it stains the mat and no amount of wiping will get it off.
Finally, they claim the ""wet"" eraser  will erase the marker in one swipe - not so because you have to push down on it and swipe at the same time several times to remove the marker.
My daughter was so disappointed with this and we are going to get theAquaDoodle - Draw N Doodle - Classic Matinstead because on that we can actually SEE our drawings!
Don't waste your money on this epic Crayola fail!
I can't even believe that this product made it out into society because it's such poor quality."
"Such a disappointment!
My daughter and I had high hopes when we opened this.
There's a good sized, attractive mat.
I loved the way it rolled up for easy carrying and storage.
The mat has places to store the markers and the wiper.
We opened the markers and my daughter got down on the floor to get drawing.
""Mommy, the markers don't work!
""Sure enough, the markers are so pale that they are almost invisible.
It's pretty bad when the most visible color is the yellow marker - and even that was barely there.My daughter tried.
She struggled with the markers, pressing harder, trying to get some color out of them.
She successfully used the wiper to remove the little color she created.And then she gave up.Until they fix the markers in this set, I cannot recommend!"
The Crayola Doodle Magic Color Mat is a good item for my 3-year old son.
A toy where he can write without making a mess is definitely good for our household.
This mat keeps him occupied for a while and he likes to show us what he is writing.
The markers definitely do show up.
You just have to wait about 30 seconds before the color really starts to develop.
Overall this is ok.
It's just not very small-kid friendly because they expect the color to be more immediate.
I think it would be best for an older child.
The age range is 3-15 years.
I would say shift that to 8-15 years and it's a better product.I don't recommend if for little kids.
If I were Crayola I'd be embarrassed to have my name on this product.
As a consumer this product is shockingly not fitting the quality I've come to expect from the brand.The mat is a pain, it doesn't lay very flat and moves all over as my daughter tries to use it.
The markers are so faint and yet they didn't properly wipe off using the 'eraser'.
I had to wipe it with a wet paper towel to get the marker all the way off.
It's also difficult to fold and my daughter can't get the markers into their holders on her own.Overall, this is a really disappointing product.
I would not recommend it at all.
This is the first item that I have gotten from Crayola that the kids have not liked.
The mat itself was cheap and the worst is the colors of the markers was very light and not dark enough.
It was not a quick erase either-it took several times and I could not get it all off.Pass on this one!
This product seemed like a great idea to me---a plastic floor mat that you could color on with Color Magic markers.
My daughter has recently gotten quite into coloring, and always is wanting more paper and bigger paper, so this seemed like it would be a terrific way to give her that and then be able to erase and reuse the surface.
Well, it WOULD have been great...Basically, the Color Magic markers just don't show up on the plastic.
You can just barely, barely see where you color.
And that is after the about 5 second delay there always is with Color Magic markets to see any color at all, making it very frustrating for young artists even when you CAN see the colors.
But in this case, anything we colored looked like the long ago shadows of something written on a whiteboard and erased---like the hint of an old picture left over.
The box shows kids coloring vivid pictures, and there is no way on earth you could do that with these markers.The set also included a little eraser---sort of the shape of a razor with a liquid in the handle that went onto a little sponge-like area where the razor surface would be.
This was supposed to erase what was colored, once you primed it.
It's ironic that always the colors barely showed up, this erase did very little to erase the minor bit of color there was.
It worked much better to use the enclosed washcloth, even dry.I'm trying to think of some positive here.
The mat did have good storage areas for the markers and washcloth, and it rolled up well.
IF the colors had worked, it would be a good product.
I wish they had.
"The idea of this toy was really great but for the most part it was a big disappointment.
These were my issues:Markers- These markers are WAY too light.
The pictures on the package and on the listing page is a big misrepresentation.
The pictures show colors that really stand out.
These are so light you can barely tell what color was used.
The 4-year-old girl that I babysit even told me ""these don't work"".
She also had difficulty getting the lids off and back on.
She brought them to me several times to pop the lids off and when I went to pick them up, none of the lids were on all the way.
I also noticed that as she was coloring and her sleeve would brush against her drawing, her picture would smear.Eraser- After pumping the eraser many times to finally get it moist, I tried it out and it worked great.
It wasn't so easy for the girl that I babysit for.
Like most little ones her age, they don't hold things the way an adult or older kid would.
She wraps all her fingers around the eraser and just swipes it messily back and fourth like a child does when they're scribbling.
I showed her over and over had to properly swipe it but she just wasn't getting the hang of it.
The problem is she's wasting a lot of the eraser solution and there doesn't seem to be much in there to start with.
What happens when this solution runs out?
The way she uses it, that won't be too long.
I absolutely love the concept of this art mat!
It has the huge potential to be BETTER than the Aquadoodle, which allows only the 1 color because you get the mat wet and the backing shows through.This uses light colored pens to write on an erasable surface.
I do understand why they made these colors lighter - so they don't leave marks behind, but they really are too light.
It is still fun, if you let your child know AHEAD of time that the colors are hard to see.Love the thought and design/portability, hope they make the markers a bit darker so creations show up better.
