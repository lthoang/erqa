Top sentence(s):
Simple trace the stencil to you liking with the provided pen, turning it to replicate the shape you choose.
A ""sliding"" holder or top and bottom pieces with magnets would allow placing the stencil holder in the middle of a larger cloth if needed.
This would make a great birthday gift for a young child or a craft for a rainy day activity.
I would most recommend it for girls who are patient enough to enjoy seeing a long craft through to the end.
Recommended for ages 5-10.

Reviews:
My daughters, age 8 and 6, both enjoyed the Mandala-Designer.
Maybe showing my age, but it reminded me of a the spirograph toy we had when I was younger.
The toy was simple to use and the girls started playing with it right out of the box with little guidance from me.
They both love arts and crafts project, so this one was right up their alley.
I was also surprised to see that they were able to play with the toy together.Relatively inexpensive, durable and well made.
Fun project toy for a rainy day!
"This is a rather simple tool for creating mandalas (circular shapes containing repeated patterns).
It includes everything you need to get started--a frame to hold the paper and align the template while you rotate and trace, two stencils, a felt-tipped pen, 3 colored pencils, and 10 papers.
Really the only parts they had to include were the frame and stencils, and it's certainly easy enough to supplement all of the rest yourself.
(Some people have complained that the paper is an irregular shape, but since mandalas are round, square paper is sort of essential.
Plus all you have to do is cut a strip off the end of an 8 1/2"" x 11"" paper and you're good to go with more.
Any colored pencils--or markers--will work for coloring the end product.
And any pen--felt-tipped or ball-point--will work for tracing more shapes.
)So you align the mandala, trace the shape inside the stencil, rotate to the next arrow, and repeat.
Very simple and easy, and it's fun to create a variety of patterns.
This one is very ""girly""--ballerina, hearts, swan, butterfly, woman's face, etc.My kids enjoyed it and had fun making patterns and testing different shapes.
Once they got the concept, it was quite easy for them to create very ""real"" looking mandalas--you couldn't tell the kids' creations apart from the adults'.
This isn't a life-changing toy, but it's fun to return to every once in a while (say, like you do with using stamps in art projects)."
Ravensburger Mandala Designer Ballerina is a fun toy for young artists.
It comes with two stencils and can be used to create all sorts of different patterns and designs with a small amount of skill and some patience.My girls love art and they took to this artistic device immediately.
They are both young and they like using a stencil because it makes it easy to produce nice, neat designs.
Kids can fill in different shapes on the stencil and make a varied work of art or concentrate on one item, rotate the stencil, and continue to create the same design to create a circular pattern.
Kids can do what they like- there is no right or wrong answer with an artistic toy such as this.If there were any negative points to bring up with this toy, it would be the lack of more stencils and the irregular paper size.
There are only two stencils, and this could be limiting to some kids.
In addition, some adults will be annoyed with the paper because it isn't a standard size and thus requires cutting paper to the right size.Overall, however, this is still a good artistic toy and the proof is the fact that my girls continue to use it long after their first encounter.
It isn't anything complex or amazing, but it is fun and is priced low enough to make it worth considering for the budding young artist in your home.
Who doesn't love stencils?
I know I do.
This is a great accessory for theDeco Mandala-Designer Drawing Machineand perfect for all the little dancers out there.
My girls are still drawing ballerinas days after this came in the mail.
I love that it is held in place by the machine and perfect for little hands that can get frustrated so easily.
I've found this also encourages my daughters to draw on their own.
They will make a ballerina with the stencil and design an entire world around her.
So much fun!
This toy offers hours of artistic play.
I definitely recommend it!
Bonus is it is very durable.
The stencils aren't floppy and it doesn't seem like they would break easily.
I love that they came with more paper and supplies.
I'm very happy with this company and their products.
This is a beautifully constructed product.
The box and stencils are durable, the felt tipped pen fits well in the stencil and it's well designed.
My 5 year old daughter has played with it a lot so far.I do have a few complaints though.
The stencil openings are excessively small.
If the felt tipped marker dies you would definitely need to go find a .3 mm (or whatever it is) replacement because nothing else you own would work (that pen does fit well though).
Also with such a well constructed product it would be really great if they included a second large stencil.
The stencil does have a lot of possibilities, but how much more would it cost to include a second one just to mix it up?
The coloring on the box is also a touch misleading - the finished product has a very stenciled look.
What's on the box was definitely made by a professional artist with lots of colors that aren't included.
Our mandalas are a lot more primitive looking.I still think it's 4 star worthy based on the construction alone.
It's unusual to find products like this one where attention was clearly paid to quality.
"I had never heard about mandalas before I got this kit, and now, having researched them a bit, I'd like to further explore the craft of creating and coloring them.
However, I was frustrated by this Ravensburger mandala creator.
My issues:*I don't think the included felt tip pen is a good choice for tracing stencils.
I had a difficult time getting a good, sharp shape.
A fine-tipped mechanical pencil would have been a much better instrument to have included for this (and you could fix mistakes!).
*Only three colored pencils are included.
For the price of this kit, I think they could have thrown in a few more.
*A special size of paper, 8.25"" x 8.25"", is required.
This means that when you run out of the included 10 sheets of paper, you will probably have to cut some other paper to size.
Since standard copier paper is 8.5"" x 11"", you will have to cut down the paper in two directions.
If they had sized the mandala creator to use 8.5"" paper, it would have made this a lot easier!
*The set only comes with one big stencil wheel and a small stencil wheel.
Again, at this price, I would have expected more to have been included.
*The instructions are very minimal.
If you have never used something like this before, you may feel frustrated as you figure it out.Overall, it's a cool idea to have a gadget that facilitates creating a symmetrical mandala, but it's a shame Ravensburger didn't go a little further to make this a better-executed kit.Update 8-10-12: I didn't have to coach my 12-year-old daughter at all on how to use this kit.
She sat down and quickly created a beautiful mandala without any help.
This product comes with two stencil discs: one large and one small.
The large disc fits into a base that holds a square piece of paper (supplied with the product).
The large stencil rotates in the holder such that the user can trace out the same pattern (or patterns) in a circle.
The smaller stencil disc fits within the larger disc and can also be rotated.
The discs have stencils of ballerinas, dance shoes, birds, stars, flowers, hearts and musical notes.
My 8.5-year-old daughter enjoys using it quite a bit.
(If you don't already know, a mandala is a typically circular design of pictures and/or shapes representing the universe, the self, inner peace, etc.
It has origins in Buddhism and Hinduim plus the work of Carl Jung.)
"The mandala-designer (Ballerina) is a circular stencil with a holder that helps make beautiful artwork.
You can use it on paper and color it - or even use the stencil to generate the pattern for canvas painting or embroidery.
The piece is well-made and does generate beautiful designs.The holder has a slot to place a piece of paper (or cloth - see below) - ~8""x8"" size.
You place the circular stencil on the paper in its slot and align it using one of 16 arrows and draw any of the patterns you want e.g the outer ring options include a rose, different ribbons, flower, musical notes, ballerina figures etc.
the inner circle has lines, stars, heart symbols etc.
The main stencil also has a smaller circular slot where another smaller stencil could fit in increasing the available options for designs.
So you can let your imagination fly and generate really beautiful patterns.A couple things that could be improved: the slot to hold the paper/cloth is fixed at the corners - this does not allow you to set the stencil on larger pieces of paper or canvass.
A ""sliding"" holder or top and bottom pieces with magnets would allow placing the stencil holder in the middle of a larger cloth if needed.
Similarly, while the ability to rotate the circular stencil allows creating beatiful circular symmetrical artwork, there is no option to lock in the stencil while drawing - slight movements of the stencil can sometimes make it distorted.Overall, very high quality, well-made stencil that allows you to generate symmetrical artwork for paining or embroidery."
My daughter helped me review this item.
She found it very delightful and fun, which says to me that this is a GREAT product.
As far as durability is concerned, it seems durable enough.
It's a simple product but if your child is into drawing and designing then I highly recommend this.
Mandalas are fun to draw and color.
Coming with two templates and 10 sheets of paper little girls would have so much fun creating their own mandalas.
The templates fit into a frame; there is an arrow on the template and the designer to match up so that the same design appears in the appropriate places.The eight- year old spent several hours on creating a beautiful mandela which we ended up framing.
It certainly was a work of art!The only drawback in this kit is there are only 3 colored pencils.
When we realized this we purchased a package of colored pencils to add to the kit itself.
I encourage you to do the same.
"My 5-year-old and I both enjoyed playing with this kit.
I'd never seen a mandala designer before, so I didn't know just what to do with it when we first took it out of the box.
Once we got the hang of it, though, she and I created two beautiful pictures worthy of hanging on the fridge before putting it away for another indoor day.My daughter's manual dexterity wasn't perfect for it, so I agree that the target market should probably be more like 6-10-year-olds, though 4- and 5-year-olds can certainly have fun with it anyway, as long as they're reasonably coordinated.The three main drawbacks are:-Not enough colored pencils (just three-- it could have used at least five or six)-Odd-sized paper, so you'll be stuck cutting not only length but also width of your 8 1/2 by 11 sheets when you run out of theirs-The arrows are not colored in any way, so it can be hard to spot where you're supposed to line them up.
I solved this by just marking the tip of each arrow with the black pen provided so we could see them easier as we moved the designs around.The only other problem I had with it is that some of the main designs (the ballerinas) had such narrow holes for drawing that you couldn't really ""outline"" a shape to color in, which was what made it more difficult for my daughter's level of coordination.
Hers ended up being more like stick figures on top, and you can't tell that all of them are ballerinas.
Even so, the designs looked really pretty."
Here's what you get in the box:-A very very cheaply made plastic frame and circular tracing template;-Three colored pencils;-One tracing pen;-Instructions-About 15 sheets of square paperMy girls enjoyed this product once.
They're 5 and needed a little help at first lining up the arrows on the frame.
After that, they were bored with it.
There is only one tracing template, so options are limited.You get a limited amount of oddly sized paper.
8 1/2 X 11 won't fit in the frame, so once you're out you'll be cutting pages for your kids (if they still want to play with it).The frame and tracing template are single pieces of the most cheap plastic you could imagine coming out of China.
One gets the impression that the box itself costs many times more than the contents.
The box is substantial, but is over 1/2 full of filler material to try to give the product a better shelf appearance.I cannot recommend this product.
This is a really great rainy day project.
It comes with everything you need to make beautiful art.
The designs are really pretty and it's so easy anyone can make great looking projects.Likes:*Fun*Easy*Pretty resultsCould be better:* Should include more paper* Would be nice to have more colors of pens* More small stencil pieces & more ballerinas doing different thingsThanks Priscilla!
This brings back fond memories of Spirograph I had as a child.
I have made some designs with it today and it is very sturdy and quite entertaining.
As an adult I enjoyed it.
There are 2 wheels a large and a small one.
Both can be rotated to make endless designs all of a very girl orientated theme of ballet and flowers, music, hearts.
It comes with a very fine point black marker and 3 colored pencils.
It has 10 sheets of white paper, like copy paper.
It is easy to cut copier paper to make more that will fit the frame that holds the wheels in place.
There are arrows that you line up so you can correctly place the designs.The box is so fine quality almost feels like it has a texture, very nice.
The item is made in the Czech Republic.
It would be nice if it came with other small wheels but from the brochure included it looks like they all come in sets.
I still think it is a great gift for any girl and some adults who love drawing and coloring.
It is for ages 6 and up but I think some 4-5 yr olds could use it if they have good motor skills.I am delighted to find a high quality toy that also encourages imagination and creativity.
Highly recommend this set.
Our six-year-old niece had a lot of fun with this when we used it the last time she came over.
It only held her attention for about an hour, but during that hour, she enjoyed making the mandala shapes and coloring them in.
It was fun and easy to use, and she had never seen anything like it before, so the novelty of it was good.
This would make a great birthday gift for a young child or a craft for a rainy day activity.
They rate this product for ages 6 and up, but my 4 year old was easily able to create on this, as well.
(My 6 year old was certainly more proficient, but the 4 year old was able to manage making mandalas on his own.)
This box comes with some square paper, a micro tip felt pen, 3 colored pencils, and the mandala stencil.
Simple trace the stencil to you liking with the provided pen, turning it to replicate the shape you choose.
Then color the mandala you created with the colored pencils.
Simple.
I wish the set came with more paper or used a traditional 8.5 x 11 size.
Once you run out of paper, you've got to cut more paper into the appropriate size square to make more mandalas.
I even enjoyed making a few mandalas myself.
(For my 2 year old, I made the mandalas and he colored them.)
My ballerina 6 year old loved it!
My 4 year old son loved it!
All in all, this is a good art set for kids.
I got this Mandala designer for my two daughters ages 8 and 6.
They both love it!
My youngest is constantly drawing pictures and coloring so she was so excited to have something a little different from what she is used to.
It comes with two mandalas one large and one small, ten sheets of paper (with instructions on how to cut your own paper to fit when you run out), a marker for the tracing, and three colored pencils.
Hopefully you have more color options already!
The mandalas are very durable.
This product is high quality and not some flimsy plastic.
I think the price is very resonable; in fact I plan on buying more of these to give as gifts!
There seems to be quite a few Mandala-Designer items out by Ravensburger and this ballerina themed offering is a winner.
My daughter was quite entertained and excited to make these stencil designs and having a smaller one included to add to the creativity was also a winner.
Some paper was provided although you will need to cut more.
A few colored pencils and a fine felt tip marker were included but we got out our own box of colored pencils for more options.
I do think that this would be a wonderful birthday party present for the young ballerina in your life.
I have many good childhood memories from sitting on the front porch with friends, drinking kool-aid and playing with the spirograph.
This toy kind of reminds me of the same thing.
We recently went on a long car ride (12 hours each way) and took the mandala designer with us.
It kept the girls quiet for many hours and they created some pretty neat mandalas.
I took it out of the box it came in and put everything into a small zippered pouch, which made it easy to clean up after and to keep track of the parts.
The Designer Ballerina Mandala was a fun toy that both my daughter and wife enjoyed thoroughly.
Here's my wife's take on it:This was  a blast to play with.
It was very easy to use and veryintuitive.
I made several mandalas that looked great.
The pen andpencils that came with it were good quality.
I will definitely buymore of these sets!
My 5 year old love this drawing toy and used it in a completely different way than intended, but I think that shows that this is a great toy.
She used it to make some of the shapes, one at a time, on all kinds of paper that she put in the device.
This might be the shortcoming of the device, is that different papers need to be cut to fit into the holder.
She was not interested in making the entire circle and didn't really understand turning the wheel around, but she was still very pleased with it.Pros:Well made (has not been broken by a 2.5 and 5 y.o.
)Good for different ages and skills.
You don't have to make the complex designs shown.Will grow with them so that someday they will probably want to make the mandalasCons:We had no idea what a Mandala was and had to look it up!If you use different paper than what is included, it has to be cut to fit in the holder.
(minor inconvenience)
My daughter found it a little difficult to manipulate and though she loves artistic endeavors, it didn't hold her interest.
It does seem to be well made, though, so for the right child it could be a good item.
This is a nice and easy to use.
But it allows for simple designs for beginners, and gradually increasingly allow for the use of the imagination.
My daughter who loves drawing and coloring, really enjoyed using this.
She is only 6 years old.
It was easy for her to trace, and I figure she can get more creative as she gets older and learns all the ways to use it.It comes with all you need to get started, including pen to trace with, 3 color pencils to color with, and some precut square paper to get you started.
But you can always get your own paper you might like or other colored pencils.
This is the perfect kit for young artists because it teaches the fundamentals of drawing.
My 10-yr old granddaughter could not wait to get into it.
The mini mandelas are fun and easy to do.
She gives them to her friends and makes them for her dolls.
The larger designs take longer but they are also easy.
The frame holds the wheel and paper steady so it's perfect for tracing the designs with the felt-tipped pen, which is provided.
The stencils are very precise and detailed.
There are lots of different combinations to create your own unique designs.Everything - including paper and 3 colored pencils -- comes in one box so this is a good kit to take camping or on car trips.
Be sure to bring extra colored pencils.
Three are not enough.
The Ravensburger 2-in-1 Mandala-Designer Ballerina is a fun family kit.
Parents and grandparents can create designs along with the kids.
This designer does everything that the battery powered ones do, but without the batteries.
My 6 year old daughter absolutely loves it.
Quality is good, but not excellent.
I don't see it lasting for many years to come with 3 kids sharing it.My main complaint is that the company doesn't sell additional cartridges for the wheels.
That would make it much more adaptable so you don't have to buy a whole new machine to get some extra designs.
Also, you have to cut the paper to size or pay a ridiculous price for pre-cut paper that you will have to pay excessively for and special order.
Just get a cheap paper cutter at Michael's and do it yourself.Overall, I think it's a good product, just limited.
Without a doubt, there were few art supplies in the 1980s that rivaled my affection forscented markersquite likeSpirograph.
Since my 6yo daughter seems determined to ride the new 80's revival offashion, music, and toys, I decide to pick up this updated version of the Spirograph, now branded as Mandala Designer.Each of the new kits is basically the same, with minor differences in which shape stencils are included in the plastic template.
I went with ballerina because, as I mentioned, I have a 6yo girl.
For those of you deprived of a Spirograph when Kenner still made them, imagine crossing a Mandelbrot with a kaleidoscope and you have a pretty good idea.
A large, toothed ring is used as the base and a smaller sprocket gets pushed around the inside with a pencil or pen.
The sprocket has a number of holes in it, resulting in different patterns depending on how long you draw out a particular groove.
The result is a patterned art that is both mathematically precise and artistically pretty.Outside of the right-brain, artistic part of this toy, the educational value of a mandala is in learning and predicting patterns.
Undoubtedly your child will first randomly gyrate the pen and be surprised at the result, but will quickly learn the hole nearest the sprocket rim has the furthest to travel around, resulting in the longest strokes, while center-sprocket designs are more compact.Since the Mandala can be done on pretty much any paper surface it makes a great kids' gift because your Picasso-in-the-making can show off their newfound talents right on their thank-you card and envelope.
I love Ravensburger puzzles, so I decided to give this a try when it became available on Amazon Vine.
The 2-in-1 Mandala-Designer literally just has two stencil circles with one fitting inside of the other.
This does give a bit more diversity, along with the cute ballerina and decorative stencils.
I'm not sure what comes in the box is really worth the retail price tag though - 2 plastic stencils, 10 pieces of paper, 3 colored pencils, and a pen.
They certainly were stingy on the colored pencils, especially when they cost so little and don't take up much space in the huge box.
The box is certainly oversized for what little is inside.
My little niece will enjoy this for a little while, but I don't see spending hours of time on it when there are only 2 stencils.
This product is a lot of fun.
At first glance, it looks a bit like a spirograph toy, but there's more to it than that.
Not only can designs be made by putting the pencil in and holding it down (which will, though, only result in simple lines--it doesn't swirl around like a spirograph), but it can also be used to create kaleidoscopic symmetrical designs as well, by turning the disk a specific number of turns after tracing a design.There's a slight learning curve to knowing what each of the stencil's designs is and how it can be used.
As an example, a set of five dots together really becomes the lines for musical notation if the disk is turned around.
Some of the ballerinas are a bit difficult to make out just by looking at the stencil.
Still, discovering these things about the toy adds to the enjoyment of using it, because the designs can be used in so many different ways.
A ballerina's foot, repeated the most frequently (at every one turn of the disk) can be used to create a flower!There are two reasons I gave it four stars, though.
The first is that the set only comes with three colored pencils--not really enough to color the mandalas as well as pictured on the box.
Children will need to supplement the set with additional colored pencils.The second is that the disk is difficult to turn--it can stick and can cause some jumps or skips because of this issue.
This is only important for the designs where the disk is turned while in use, but it doesn't turn as easily as it should.Projects take quite some time to complete, since there is so much drawing involved, followed by coloring.
One mandala can take at least a few sittings to finish.
I would most recommend it for girls who are patient enough to enjoy seeing a long craft through to the end.
Also, much of the time spent on the craft is in inking it (with the included pen) and coloring, so the most fun part of using the mandala designer is over with rather quickly, and most of the time devoted to the craft is a similar to coloring in a coloring book.
My granddaughter is 7 and loves to draw and color.
The Mandala Designer makes it easy for her to create beautiful art that she can color.
The templates were a little tricky for her to understand at first, but once she got the hang of it everything was simple and her designs became more elaborate.
It comes with a fine point pen that allows her to draw the design, but only comes with 3 colored pencils to color it with.
Luckily she has a large collection of colored pencils and crayons that let her expand on the designs.The plastic seems durable enough and it does not feel like it would break easily.
Our only complaint is the odd paper size, as other reviewers mentioned.
The paper must be cut exactly 8 1/4 inches square.
We have a paper cutter so we won't have a problem with that, but it would be more troublesome for someone without a paper cutter.I'm giving it 4 stars, with the paper size taking one star away.
My granddaughter gives it 5 stars.
This is great for little girls, or any ballerina.
It's like one of those olden days Spirographs, remember those?
This one draws ballerinas, and other ballet type pictures, very cute, and quite entertaining.
Just put your colored pencil or pen in the graph and twirl away.
Like doing ballet on a paper!
This mandala is fun to use and produces lovely results easily.
The mandala itself seems very sturdy to me, although the blue plastic frame that it is stored in does not.
The blue storage frame, coupled with the box is bulky.
I wish the mandala came in a thinner box for ease of storage.It's true that there are only 3 colored pencils and just 1 marker that come with the set, but colored pencils are easy to find.
Anyone who is really enjoying this mandala could fly through the 10 sheets of paper provided quickly and would need to cut more paper themselves.
It wouldn't be too hard to do this with printer paper or art paper.
Overall, this mandala is fun, sturdy and easy to use.
I have purchased many Ravensburger puzzles for my family and we love working on them.
The puzzles are of high quality and not only beautiful but also durable.
Naturally, when I had a chance to try one of the mandala designers made by the same company, I could not resist.This ballerina mandala designer is perfect for young girls who love ballet, though there are many other themed mandala designers offered by the same company that would appeal to both boys and girls.
This can be used as an educational tool to teach and reinforce the concepts of symmetry and asymmetry.
It can also be used to foster creativity among young children.
As with most Ravensburger products, the quality of the frame and templates is good, and the kit comes with three color pencils in beautiful shades of blue, pink, and peach.
There is also a fine point, black pen.
There is a large pink circular template/mandala, and a smaller yellow template/mandala.
With a bit of creativity, a child can compose many designs with these templates.
There is an instruction booklet as well.
Recommended for ages 5-10.
