Top sentence(s):
I played this with my son & while he has a pretty expansive vocabulary for a ten year old, this proved challenging for him & then I realized I was being challenged as well as having fun scrambling through my brain to find the words to beat the buzzer.
The only change I would make to this game would be to add a visual indicator and an off switch for the auditory buzzer.
The last person to be able to pick a new word in the category wins the card.PROS- Super easy to set up, the explanation of how to play lasts about 2 minutes- Induces roars of laughter throughout the game- It's challenging and a good &#34;think on your feet&#34; learning activity- The whole family can play (I'd say kids over 6) and it's even fun with all adults- It was great to bring to work and use as a teambuilding exercise where we made up our own categories- Cards are stored in the game so easy to accessCONS- None!
We went through all the categories after playing four times.
When you pick a card you must announce the topic, push the timer button & come up with a word that fits the description with 10 seconds.

Reviews:
Kids of all ages can enjoy this game.
Although the recommended age is 8+, kids as young as 6 can enjoy.
My son played it with older kids and they all had fun.
I thought the timer ticking was getting annoying after a while, but kids did not seem to be bothered with it.
There are quite a few category cards, so the game can be interesting for some time.
It was amusing to see kids searching for words in their heads to come up with the answer before the timer runs out.
I played this with my son & while he has a pretty expansive vocabulary for a ten year old, this proved challenging for him & then I realized I was being challenged as well as having fun scrambling through my brain to find the words to beat the buzzer.
The only change I would make to this game would be to add a visual indicator and an off switch for the auditory buzzer.
The game is quick to learn and my family has played with people aged 7 to 70.
It's challenging enough to be interesting for the younger kids, but for teens and up it's super easy.
We almost always end up going to tiebreaker rounds where you have to give two or three answers during your turn.
Scattergories is more fun; I'll keep this one around for the under 12 crowd.
My kids and I love this fun, fast word game.
With a stack of topic cards, you gather around the game and take turns  hitting different letters as you come up with words for each letter that relate to the topic.
My 10 and 13 year olds could play this with ease.
The 5.5 year old needed a little help but wanted to be part of the action.
A game we will play over and over.
I really had no idea what to expect from Tapple - honestly I was a big dubious.
We LOVE it!
Our family of 3 (our daughter is 10) has been playing every night.
What a cute, clever, original game.
I love how we can play for any length of time - 10 minutes after dinner - or a marathon afternoon.
When you read the directions, it sounds like it might be too &#34;easy.&#34; However, once you have the time pressure going, it becomes quite challenging (in a good way).
If you play with a larger group, it might be &#34;easier&#34; because you will have more time to think of your next answer - however, there are then fewer answers to choose from, so I guess it all evens out.
I recommend this game!
This is an easy-to-learn game with minimal set-up.
It&#8217;s fast-paced and the rounds and the games go quickly.
The circular game board has letters from which to select and a 10-second time.
A player draws a card and picks one of two categories to play, such as &#8220;Pizza Toppings&#8221;.
The first player thinks of something that fits that category, such as &#8220;Cheese&#8221;, and presses the &#8220;C&#8221; on the board.
The next player now needs to think of a pizza topping, but can&#8217;t use the letter &#8220;C&#8221;.
Play continues until only one player remains.
Then, the round is over and the next player chooses a card.The game requires 2 &#8220;AA&#8221; batteries that are not included.
There is a storage place on the bottom of the game board for the cards.
If the timer wasn&#8217;t so loud, it would be a great game for the car.
It would be good to bring on a trip to play once you arrived, since it&#8217;s compact with self-contained storage for the cards.
This is a great game for families because the cards are double-sides with different difficulty levels on each side.It was harder than it seems to come up with things that fit the category beginning with one of the available letters, within the time-limit.
Younger kids may get bored after a few rounds, but great game for passing a short amount of time.
It would be nice if it came with more cards, because if it did become a family favorite, it wouldn&#8217;t take long to go through the cards.
Still, it&#8217;s a fun family game.
WHAT IT IS:TAPPLE is a table-top game that keeps players on their toes by forcing them to provide answers starting with various letters within a brief time limit.
The game itself is a plastic wheel/circle with individual letter tabs are attached to its circumference.
The letters are in order and all letters are represented except U, X, Y and Z.
In the middle of the wheel is a large button that starts/stops a 10-second timer.
A storage compartment underneath the &#8220;wheel&#8221; stores a stack of topic cards with two topics listed on each side.
The topics are color coded to indicate difficulty.
An AA battery for the timer is included.HOW IT WORKS:The player designated to start the game pics a card, choses a topic from the card, states an answer and presses down the first letter of the answer (thus eliminating that letter from being used again in subsequent answers).
The timer is pressed, giving the next player 10-seconds to provide another answer beginning with a different letter.
This procedure continues until someone can&#8217;t provide an answer using an available letter within the 10 second time-frame.
The last person to provide a successful answer wins the round and gets to keep the card.
Reset bars on the inner rim of the &#8220;wheel&#8221; release the depressed letters for the next round.
The overall winner is determined by the person possessing a designated number of topic cards.WHY IT&#8217;S FUN:First, it&#8217;s simple to learn.
Second, it can be played by kids and adults.
Third, the anxiety of the 10-second timer combined with the frustration of trying to find answers that begin with the remaining letters usually leads to people blurting out ridiculous/funny stuff before the timer goes off.TAPPLE is a good family game that combines wit, memory and speed.
For younger kids, it&#8217;s a fun way to reinforce the association of letter sounds.
Another plus is that the game is self-contained with no loose parts (the cards are stored in the game itself).
This is kind of like the game Hands Down but with letters and a better chance for everyone to win.
If you ever watched Password Plus on TV, this is like the lightning round.
Tricky to learn at first, but after a few minutes, we were all having a blast.Our teenagers loved this game and have found many variations of play to suit their own ideas of fun.
It is a fast paced game and really quite challenging.
We enjoyed playing as a family and were quite thankful that some of the less commonly used letters were not put on the wheel.
This is a great family game since it has a wide age range and moves fast.
Pretty much once a kid can figure out words that start with a given letter, they can play.
It requires some rudimentary vocabulary skills but it can be silly fun and fast paced to keep everyone, even the non-gamers, entertained.
It also doesn't require score keeping to be fun--we sometimes just play games like this without a scorekeeper.
Sometimes the challenge is fun enough.
Essentially this is a hyperactive Scattergories without pencils or paper and all the quiet time.UPDATE: This game was the hit of the holidays at my house.
The kids--ages 8-14--and adults of all ages enjoyed it.
It was played almost daily and was the most requested game.
The resident four year old was frustrated because he wanted to play and push buttons, too, so a few times we even adapted and asked him to find the letters to push for us.
Highly recommended!
So Tapple actually plays differently than I imagined.
I pictured a cross between Boggle and Scattergories.
However, it is most like the Alphabet game my children and I used to play when they were little, where we'd randomly pick a category and try to find something that fit that category for each letter in the alphabet.ABOUT THE GAME: A category is selected (by choosing a colored side of the cards) and players have to come up with a response and depress the lever for the alphabet letter that their answer matches.
Turns take place in sequence until only one player is left.
If all letters are used, you go to another round for that category and players name two things at a time.
The yellow levers pictured restore the letters to their upright position after they have been depressed.
The hardest to use letters (Q, U, V, X, Y, Z) are not included among the levers.
Everyone can play this game as once but it seems best when you have 4-6 players.
More than 6 and it gets awkward because the board does have to be within reach of everyone or handed around.
Also, as everyone gets 10 seconds on the timer (if they use it all), the more who play, the longer each card takes to finish.PROS: The category cards are stored in the game (underneath in a compartment next to the battery section).
The game is interactive and plays quickly and the categories do have lots of options, so the alphabet letters are not so daunting, even as they are used up.
Also, the cards are differentiated by color, so if you have a mix of adults and kids, you can opt to play the easier categories and save the other categories for when you have all adults playing.That is not to say that there won't be some discussion around &#34;creative&#34; answers, just like you have in most social games.
The four people playing it were having so much fun that two folks walking past on their way to the kitchen just had to sit down and join the game.At first, it seemed like the 10 seconds on the timer were too long but as the letters wind down, or you go to playoff rounds where you have to name two things in a category within that timespan and depress the levers (and in one round we had to go to naming three at a time to resolve a tie) it makes sense.CONS: There aren't many cards included but the game can be played with most categories you think of and points recorded on a pad of paper, so its usability is extended.Overall, a fun family and party game.
A very basic concept and not unlike Scattergories but the interaction of everyone at once and the interactive game board make for a good time.
My family loves games and this looked like a fun game for a group get together.
The game is simple and even the kids can play.
You start with a category and then must name an answer that starts with a certain letter.
You then push that letter in and pass to the next player.
They must come up with an answer that starts with another letter and then push the letter in and pass it to the next player.
You cant use a letter twice.
The game is lots of fun and you get some great answers.
I would recommend playing at a table though as it makes it a little easier to see what has been pushed and also the letters sometimes get pushed down when passing the game and you can reset the letters without resetting all of them  MY other complaint is they left out a few letters such as u, v, q, x, y, and z.  I would have loved to have all the letters available.
Overall though lots of fun.
A new family game that everyone can play.
This is a fun game that's easy to adapt for all ages.
My four year-old can name the letter she is pressing down, my six year-old can name a word starting with that letter, and older ages can use the categories, which come in two difficulty levels.
It's solidly built, and I like that it has a compartment for the cards built into the game, so you don't even really need the box to store it.
The only real confusion we had is assuming the timer would automatically reset when the letter tile is pressed.
It doesn't, you have to tap the red hand as well, but that doesn't pose any difficulty once you're aware of it.
I played this on two occasions with my regular games group and we really enjoyed it.
Most of us were adults but one 13 year-old was playing both times.
I normally get too stressed out with timed games, but we're a light-hearted bunch, so it was just funny, not stressful.The game takes about 5 seconds to learn.
You just turn over a category card and go around the table saying an item that begins with one of the letters on the &#34;board&#34;.
Sometimes it's not a matter of not being able to come up with an item in the allotted 10 seconds, but the letter you need was already used.
You keep going around until only one person is left.Sometimes the group has to make a call as to whether the person's answer is valid.
My group had a fun time once with the category &#34;weather&#34;.
We were running out of letters and one person hit the 'n' and said &#34;nice&#34;.
We had a laugh about it being a questionable answer but ended up just continuing.
So I hit the 'j' and said &#34;just peachy&#34;.
Ah, fun times.Warning: The game requires 2 AA batteries that aren't included.
This is a fun, fast-paced category guessing game that all ages can play.
It's a good backseat travel game because there is only one game piece (the tapple wheel).
Category cards are conveniently stored within the wheel.We enjoy playing Tapple--rounds go fast and it's a quickly learned game.
Because the category topics are so diverse, even the smarties get tested and they don't necessarily win, especially as letters are eliminated and pressure mounts.One small complaint--there are only 144 category topics on 36 cards.
That may seem like a lot, but it's easy to go through 1/4 of those categories in one game sitting.
We went through all the categories after playing four times.
Of course, even if those categories have been used/seen before, each game will have a different outcome, especially if playing with a new crowd or age bracket.
It just seems a $25 game could have supplied twice as many cards.
This game was easy to learn and fun for my group.
I'm surprised by how fast a game goes, we played about 3 times in an hour.
There was lot's of laughing throughout the game as we came up with answers that reflected our personalities.
While this isn't my go-to game, it is one that I'm gladly keeping on my shelf.
Our family enjoys family game night, and this one provides a quick time word game that our kids liked.Basically, one choses a topic from a drawn card, taps down a letter of the alphabet(the Scrabble hard letters are left out) while stating a word that matches with the letter that still remains up within the short time period.It requires 2 AA batteries, otherwise, immediately playable.
The letters tapped down are released by a yellow lever when time to begin again.
It states for 8 and older.
Younger kids may not have enough time to think up and answer.
We give them an extra try.
Fun, fast, simple.
This is great for family play and the unique &#34;board&#34; gives a new, fun twist to an old game.
It's compact to store and even has a compartment for the cards.
We've played with a wide range of ages and it's fun for everyone.
You might need to give the youngest kids two cycles on the timer to even the playing field.
There's a decent supply of category cards, but it's also easy to make up your own.
Lots of fun!
This will easily become a family favorite.
We played this last night for the first time.Things I like - easy to follow directions, makes you think fast, suitable for ages indicated.
We even let one of the grandsons play (age 6) and with a little help he did pretty good.
No set up - game is ready to go straight out of the box.
If you like games to play with the family then I would recommend this one.
I am a bonafide board game junkie so when a new game comes along my granddaughter, Addie and I LOVE to review them.
Tappple, from USAopoly is a great, new game that is quick to learn and fun to play.
Choose a category card and start the timer on the Tapple wheel.
In just 10 seconds, name a word matching the category, press the first letter of that word on the wheel, tap the button to reset the timer, and pass it along.
Letters already pressed may not be used again, so the pressure mounts!
Can&#8217;t think of a word in time, you&#8217;re out for the round.
The player that collects the most cards wins!This is not only a fun game but a challenging one, as well.
I would place the age range from 8 years to 88 years.This game requires 2 AA batteries and the design of the wheel lets you store the cards inside the bottom of the wheel so it is quite portable.My granddaughter and I also made our own &#34;silly stack&#34; of category cards and play with them also!Great family fun!
We love the game Scrabble and this adds a whole new dimension to it!
Almost like mixing Scattegories and Scrabble and you get Tapple!
Fun times for those as young as 7 or 8 (be fair and go slow for them!)
- right on up to the senior grandparents.
It was nice hearing everyone laugh and enjoy time together!
I can see us enjoying this at the beach house or on a snowy day!
5 stars!
GREAT gift!
We are a family that has (tries to anyway) weekly game nights, so we're always looking for new board games to put into the rotation.
Tapple was a huge hit, both for the kids, and adults.The game play is relatively simple.
You pick a card that states a general category (e.g.
junk food) and then each player has 10 seconds to name one item from that category.
The trick is that once you name something that starts with a letter (e.g.
chips), you can't use that letter again.
Letters are pressed on the wheel to indicate which have been used already.
If you can't do it within your allotted (very brief) time, you're out.
The round ends when only one player is left standing.The format allows for quick game play: you can make it as short or long as you want, playing for time, or, as we did, the first person to five &#34;points&#34; (a.k.a.
round wins).
And you can even, pretty easily, make up your own categories, allowing for fairly limitless replay potential and plenty of imagination.Though the ages say 8+, our 6-year-old was able to play this easily, as long as we selected general categories with which he reasonably has knowledge.Great idea and one I'm sure we'll play again and again.
My family loves this game, and even though it says '8+' for age, you can squeak in some children who are a bit younger.
You get a category and have to pick a word that fits the category in 10 FAST seconds.
You then depress the letter and play moves to the next person, who has to find another word that fits in 10 seconds.
If they can't, they are out for that round.
The last person to be able to pick a new word in the category wins the card.PROS- Super easy to set up, the explanation of how to play lasts about 2 minutes- Induces roars of laughter throughout the game- It's challenging and a good &#34;think on your feet&#34; learning activity- The whole family can play (I'd say kids over 6) and it's even fun with all adults- It was great to bring to work and use as a teambuilding exercise where we made up our own categories- Cards are stored in the game so easy to accessCONS- None!
Well, maybe that it's addicting!
"Our family members love board games.
After our Thanksgiving dinner, we played TAPPLE for the 1st time.
The youngest player was a 7 year old.
Everyone else were adults.
The only concession to the 7 year old's age was that when she played we used the side of the cards with the easier topics (""Pizza toppings"", ""Ice cream flavors"").
When she wandered off we played with the more difficult side of the cards(""7-letter words"", ""Cosmetics & toiletries"").
The game has all of the alphabet, with the exception of Q, U, V, X, Y, Z on keys that can be pressed down.
When you pick a card you must announce the topic, push the timer button & come up with a word that fits the description with 10 seconds.
You push down the letter that corresponds with the 1st letter of your word.
Once a letter is used, it can't be used again during that game.
The next person has 10 seconds to try to come up with a word that matches the same topic.The Pros: #1 The game is fun.
It's easy to learn.
Because there are 2 levels of cards, young players can join in the fun.
There is a neat little compartment on the bottom of the wheel where the cards can be stored which makes the game very compact & portable.
Each round goes rather quickly.
If you don't have all day to build hotels on Park Place, you can still play TAPPLE.The Cons: The ticking of the darn timer is too loud.
This is a fun game to play with a wide range of ages in the mix.
A single game could easily be played by adults and children with everyone having an equal chance of winning.
The gameplay itself is fun and engaging.
I consider this game's strength to be the simplicity of the rules.
The rules are straightforward and logical, making it no problem to quickly add another player who is unfamiliar with the game.
The creative nature of the game allows it to become silly and for the players to be creative in their answers.The quality of the game itself feels very cheap, especially for the price.
Also, when you press a letter, the timer should automatically reset.
Tapple is a fun game that requires on the spot thinking in order to win.
This is a faster-pacedversion, in some ways, of the familiar game Scattergories.
I recently sat down with my familyto play this game, mostly because we needed to review it, and we thought we were only goingto play for 20 minutes or so.
An hour and a half later, we were still playing!With this game, you play in rounds.
There is a category selected for each round: there are blue/whitethemes and on the other side of the card, yellow/red.
I can't remember which one, it says in the instructions,but one side is supposed to be &#34;harder&#34; than the other.
We played for a good amount of time and we foundthat is really up for negotiation as some of the supposed &#34;harder&#34; cards were easy to us and some of the&#34;easy&#34; cards proved to be quite difficult!After one player has selected a category, you press the button in the center which starts a 10 second timer.Each player has a total of 10 seconds to come up with something that starts with one of the letters on the game.You must say the name and press down the letter before the 10 second timer runs out.
The next person thenstarts the timer for themselves and takes their turn.
If you can't think of anything in the 10 seconds, you areout.
The last person left in the round wins the card.
We didn't have a &#34;set&#34; number of cards to get to win butyou could certainly come up with whatever number you choose.
This game moves fast enough that you couldmake it a 10 minute game or 1 1/2 hours, as my family and I did.I think individuals of all ages would enjoy this game.
My boyfriend and I are in college and we played with myparents.
We had a lot of wonderful laughs during this game.
I actually brought it with me to college to playwith my friends because it was so entertaining!
A highly recommended game.
