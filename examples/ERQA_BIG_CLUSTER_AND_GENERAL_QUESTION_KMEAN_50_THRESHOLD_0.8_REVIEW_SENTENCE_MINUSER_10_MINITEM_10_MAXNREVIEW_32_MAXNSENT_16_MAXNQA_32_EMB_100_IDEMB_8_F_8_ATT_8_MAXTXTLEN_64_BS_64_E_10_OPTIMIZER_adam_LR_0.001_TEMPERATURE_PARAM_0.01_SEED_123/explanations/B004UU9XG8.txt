What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen?

"The very first thing out of the mouths of the twins (4.5 years old) before we even started the assembly process was ""Where are the people?""
For the price this is a good, solid, large toy but it makes you feel you have to run out and buy the proper sized people to go with it, it really should include at least two people, or, bump the price up and include a whole family, that would be best.
Right now the girls are using some of their many 3 inch Disney Princess dolls to go in it.
One reviewer said it would have been nice if the luggage were removable, I don't mind that it is not, less small pieces to get lost.
It is nice that there are so many ways it unfolds, the girls like the whole feeling of secret compartments and such.
The little beach playmat did not want to flatten out very well, no biggie, some time in a book will help.
The assembly was easy, instructions were clear, except that the instructions did not explain where the adult sized bed went in, I had to look at the pictures on the box to figure out where it goes.
So, great toy for the money, just needs to come with people, that's my only real complaint."
"The already chock full Loving Family doll ""series"" just got chock fuller with this latest addition.
Some of the other add on playsets to the LF doll house made me scratch my head and wonder what kid would want that, but this camper is pretty awesome (and fun).
All three of my kids (6, 4 and 1) play with this, probably more than any other LF item besides the house itself.The only real drawback is that there are no ""action"" items on this...would have been nice to add head lights that work, or a horn, or even a lamp that works inside (but thankfully not another radio...the one in the minivan drives me crazy!
).Construction is similar to the rest of the series, which is not great (esp.
the minivan, whose doors fall off very easily), but it does seem slightly better constructed than the van.The fold-up  beds are cool, and the bed on top is a nice touch too.PROS:Very nice addition to the LF setSeems a little more sturdy than the questionable minivanNice variety inside with plenty of different rooms, and cool little items to discover like the built in shower.CONS:No light or sound items (lights or a horn would have been cool)General complaint about LF stuff...it's slightly too small IMO...just a tiny increase in size of all the items would make this set perfect!Doors don't open (maybe they learned their lesson from the van after so much negative feedback, but come on, the doors should open!
Just make them a little sturdier than the van doors)Overall, I can easily recommend this camper to any kid that has Loving Family dolls and/or houses.4/5"
The Fisher Price Loving Family Beach Vacation Mobile Home is a fun child's toy made for girls who love dolls and are always looking for new ways to play with them and enjoy them.
This toy is a mobile home, but it is basically a child's dollhouse on wheels, folding open to reveal different rooms for hours of imaginative play.My girls love their dolls and they own dozens of them, so they took an instant liking to this toy.
Probably the most striking aspect of the toy is its colorful components.
The interior features colors like green, pink, and blue and the accessories add some orange and other colors.
The mobile home has some movable parts, too, like a microwave door that opens, an opening refrigerator door, turning steering wheel, and flipping toilet seat.
The moving parts are few, but they still manage to stimulate the imagination.
There are no included dolls with this toy, but most children will have no problem integrating the dolls they already have into the mobile home and enjoying the imagination that it inspires.My kids like this toy and it is certainly an above average piece of fun, but if there is one way that Fisher Price could make it better, it would be to add some sounds, lights, or something else to stimulate the senses.
Flashing lights would require batteries, which some may not like, but sound effects could be added without the need for batteries.
The added sound of a honking horn, a motor starting up, flushing toilet, or something would make the toy more appealing to the average kid, most of whom still want something that appeals to the different senses.Girls love dolls and the Fisher Price Loving Family Beach Vacation Mobile Home is a good toy for young girls who want a new way to display and play with their assortment of dolls.
There are no sounds or lights and no actual family of dolls included, but the toy does offer a fold- out interior house and several accessories that are good for hours of entertainment.
"My girls love this toy!
A great addition to the Loving Family collection, but my girls are actually using it with Little People and LPSO toys and having a blast.
The included accessories are super adorable!
Especially the plates of food.
They're the reason I bumped the educational value to a 4.
It is a great way to stimulate imagination and encourage creative play.Only gripe is the instructions for assembly aren't the best.
I've assembled numerous toys in my time as a parent and couldn't believe I was confused by something so small.
I was actually shocked to see it even required assembly.
Attaching the blue ""luggage rack"" was easy peasy, but the ladder was a pain.
It has to be just so and requires a bit of muscle to get everything snapped in.
I'm still searching for the spot on the underside that requires a screw.
Maybe the husband will have better luck.
The instructions are just so vague and the photos to assist aren't nearly as detailed as I would have liked.I am a little concerned about the stability of the front of the vehicle.
If a child were to apply weight with a hand to the front I'm not sure if the attached part will hold or possibly snap right off.
I guess only time will tell.
It would have been nice if the vehicle was one solid piece especially with a recommended age of 36 months - 7 years.
My 4 year old daughter really likes this toy.
She loves to drive it around on the floor and pretend the doll family is going on vacation to the beach.
We have the Loving Family dollhouse sold at Target along with the Minivan.
This makes a great addition.
It does not come with any dolls, so is probably only useful if you already have some Loving Family collection.
I really liked this vacation mobile home.
My daughter loves it.
It's also the ideal size for her Strawberry Shortcake dolls.
There are so many things for the dolls to get up to in this little home.
They cook in the kitchenette or lounge around on the couch.
When closed, the mobile home can be pushed like a regular car.
I really like the detailing of it.
Instead of stickers, which come off, much of the decoration is done in the plastic or painted on.I notice in the picture the top window is pink.
On the one we have it's yellow.
Also that window and the floor that folds down to reveal the couch have fallen off the home a couple of times.
They are fairly easy to snap back in.It does require a small amount of assembly.
You'll need a screwdriver.
My only difficulty came in that when I opened the packaging, the screws came out and were not included in the plastic bag with the instructions.
The instructions were hidden by the beach mat inside the plastic bag.Overall, a great buy if you have Loving Family dolls or other small dolls of a similar size.
"I didn't think my daughter would really like this toy so much, but it has provided her with hours and hours of play time fun.
First, it functions sorta like a doll house--since it has all the trappings such as furniture, bedroom, kitchen, picnic bench, living room, bathroom with functional toilet seat, etc.
Then, it functions like an automobile since she puts her dolls in it and ""drives"" to the grocery store, to the beach, to the camp ground, to school, back to the real doll house home again, etc.
I guess this should be obvious, since a mobile home is exactly that--vehicle and house in one.
I just didn't think that putting them together in toy form would also be as efficient and make play so flexible.There is a little assembly involved.
I didn't find the directions until well after I had the toy assembled.
So, it's pretty straight forward to snap together (but you should know that you lift the driver's seat and snap the front and back of the vehicle together, then push the seat down again.
1 screw is used on the underside of this seat to secure it in place afterwards.
The remaining three screws are used on the top of the turquoise ""luggage rack"" once you snap that it place.We didn't have the Fisher Price Loving family set to use with this, but it was fairly adaptable with the toys we already had.
Barbie dolls are far too large to fit, but Barbie's little sister Kelly was a perfect fit.Thirty dollars seemed a little steep for this toy, and I'm not entirely sure that I would have opted to spend my holiday money on this gift.
But given how much use I've seen gotten out of it, I would definitely say that it is probably worth the money.If you found this review helpful, please let me know."
The Fischer Price Loving Family Beach Vacation Mobile Home is a fun, colorful toy.
My almost 4 year-old nieces love it.
The mobile home rolls like a toy truck when closed up.
It also opens up to rooms that allow her imagination to have fun.
It has several accessory pieces (including people figures and even a toilet) but they are large enough not to be a choking hazard.
This is a wonderful little toy that any little girl will enjoy.
"I got the Loving Family Beach Vacation Mobile Home for my 4 year old niece who loves her Loving Family Dollhouse.
I had no problem with the few screws needed to put the mobile home together and had it all set up for her in about 15 minutes if that.
She was thrilled to have a vehicle to go with her dollhouse.
I think part of the appeal is that the mobile home can easily be taken from room to room or Grandma's house.
Her dollhouse stays in the playroom, but the mobile home goes all over the house.
She really enjoys the table and chairs and has had several mobile home beach picnics.
While the wheels do turn, she doesn't really ""drive"" the mobile home around, but loves setting it up and just playing with it.
Originally I had planned to leave the mobile home at my house for her to play with when she comes over, but she begged me to let her take it home with her and my sister in law says she plays with it pretty much every day.
It's been dropped a few times, but is holding up well.
Nothing has broken or even chipped.
It would have been nice if a doll or two came with the set, but she does already have her family for her dollhouse, so that wasn't really an issue.
All in all the Mobile Beach House has been a hit, Loving Family is really a great line for little girls."
"My impressions of this vehicle were positive the moment I took the vehicle out of the box, and the more I looked at the vehicle the more impressed I became.
This mobile home has lots of features and bright colors, perfect for toddlers and younger children.
The vehicle has a couple of minor issues that may present challenges for younger toddlers.The vehicle does require some minor assembly.
The luggage rack needs attached to the top of the vehicle using three Phillips head screws.
Another Phillips head screw goes into the bottom of the vehicle into the driver's seat.
Note that the screw on the bottom goes into the seat at an angle.
As with the luggage rack on top, the intent of the screw on the bottom is to hold the front portion to the rest of the mobile home.
A ladder attaches to the side of the mobile home via a series of snaps.
As with the screws on the top and bottom, the ladder is yet another mechanism that holds the front part of the mobile home to the rest of the mobile home.
While this paragraph is lengthy, it only takes minutes to assemble the four screws and the ladder.Now comes the fun stuff.
The driver's compartment has a steering wheel that turns.
The dashboard is all one piece and one color, but it has various controls and a navigation system formed as part of the dashboard.
The driver's seat has a seatbelt, though it is an integral part of the seat.Aft of the driver's compartment is a kitchen with a sink, refrigerator, and microwave.
The kitchen includes colorful elements molded into the kitchen, such as utensils, towel, oven mitt, and range.
The kitchen also includes an open window.
While the refrigerator and microwave doors close reasonably easily, the microwave I found slightly difficult to open.
"I babysit my 3 year old niece and after I received the Fisher Price Loving Family Beach Vacation Mobile Home as a vine product she was so excited to come to my house!
She already has the Loving Family home and family members, so she knew just what to expect from this line of toys.
It did take a little while for her to figure out how to open and close it up.
But that kept her occupied as well - as a good toy should!
She loved the chairs and faux beach that came with it.
She kept saying she wished she had her ""people"" with her to use them to play with, but my boys little army guys did the trick for the time being.
If I were to offer a suggestion to improve the product I would ask that at least one family member be included with the mobile home.
Overall I think it was great fun for the money!"
My 2 1/2 year-old grand-daughter was incredibly excited when this was unpackaged.
I find that it's difficult to find toys for girls -- for boys it's easy but for girls, there are limitations.
This was a nice alternative to the typical gift of a doll.There are plenty of little interior items which can be moved around to hold the child's interest.
Think of this van/camper as a doll house on wheels and there you have it.There's not much more to say -- this toy has held her interest over time and she frequently chooses it over her dolls.Highly recommended.
My family loves Fisher-Price Loving Family toys!
When this Amazon Vine review product arrived I was disappointed at first because it didn't have the instruction sheet and assembly was a little tricky- I managed to eventually get it all put together but then noticed two chips in the picnic table.
That is kind of unusual as most Loving Family toys are totally well built.I called the 800 number and talked to customer service.
They were quick and efficient and what they chose to do totally exceeded my expectations.
I did have to find numbers on the box and she guided me patiently as I found the appropriate numbers.
She made special note of the suggestion I made regarding the product line and was a joy to work with.
I have no qualms about doing business in the future with Fisher-Price and their products.Now about the product.
This is a cute camper.
Past large well used motor homes often have missing doors, windows and issues.
This one is smaller, sturdier and has cute pop out beds and looks pretty darn rugged.
The picnic table and chairs don't seem  quite as strong as some of the other accessories in this iine.
I'm looking forward to lots of great play time with outstanding product by an outstanding company.
