Reviews:
This is so cute!
The little dogs mouth moves very well as it is talking and singing.
It keeps our kids (ranging from two and a half to five) very enthralled.
They stop what they are doing and gather around Smarty Ants to watch and listen.
The standard program includes several songs and a series of phonetics for them to learn.
It also has a 30 day enrollment to their website to download other series, and has a wired computer connection included.
It seems to be pretty durable however I am afraid to let the kids handle it too much, it is white!
As an adult I found that some of the singing was hard to understand, but the kids don't seem to have any problems understanding it.
This cute little dog is really fun but the computer program takes up a ton of memory over a meg.
We have also had trouble getting new songs on the dog.
However my five year old daughter loves the online world that comes with the dog.
It is a online world of learning.
Your dog also joins you on your adventures.
It comes with one month free but after that there is a cost, I believe it was 25 dollars for 6 months.
It was 3am, and I heard noises in the house.
Worried, I walked into the hallway and heard it was from our little guy's bedroom.
He was in there playing with the Smarty Ants pup!
I can't get him to stop!
He is excited by all the features and is quickly learning about different vowel and consonant sounds, is enjoying the games, stories, and activities.
This thing is the BEST!
It is comprehensive, cuddly, and fun--effortless learning in a friendly package.
Way to go!I wish this product were still available.
Anybody know?
I want another!
"Very, very cute little dog... but I won't put up with all the hoops of signing up for Smarty Ants and downloading the large files, then paying the monthly fees to keep a subscription.Here are their listed PC Minimum System Requirements:Operating System: Windows XP Service Pack 2, Windows Vista or Windows 7Processor: Pentium 4 or EquivalentMemory: 512 MBVideo Memory: 128MB with Pixel Shader 2.0 and Vertex Shader 2.0Sound Card: DirectX CompatibleDirectX: 9.0cHard Drive Space: 2GBAs I'm sure the owner of this company is noticing, parents don't want to pay monthly subscription fees for games.
The thing is, there's already a lot on the market for phonics and reading readiness-- handheld games for kids, books, free programs on the computer (like Starfall), TV gaming console systems, etc.
And with any of the physical products, you own them and can pass them onto your next kids, your family members, resell them, donate them to a charity, etc.
With a subscription, as soon as you stop paying, it's gone and there's no value left in it for you.This would have to be stupendous for me to pay on an ongoing basis-- and from what I've seen, it's not.
What's available on the dog without signing up already got on my nerves, and the preview video was nothing special.
So I'm left with a cute stuffed animal that's hiding in the closet now because I don't want to hear the darn ""Cat on Mat"" rhyme again."
"The concept of this toy is intriguing---an online learning system that is combined with a real-life talking toy to support the learning when the game is off.
I am not a huge fan of electronic learning games, but my kids like them, so I figured I'd let them give this a try.
My primary evaluator was a 4.5 year old boy who is a wiz with all things electronic.Before you read my review, remember that the price of this is not really just the $30 for the dog, but the yearly subscription you need to buy to enable the program.
The price is not even listed on Amazon, but it is $25/3 months, or $50 for one year.
To get you hooked, the designers give you a 2 week free trial.I opened the package and showed it to my kids--ages 6, 4, and 3.
They all thought the dog was really funny, and they took turns carrying it around and pushing the paw.
The stuffed animal is soft, and the robotic motions are kind of cool as it sings various songs when you squeeze the paw.
It is actually rather cuddly, which is saying something for a robotic dog.
They all laughed as it spoke, and my son enjoyed running around the house making it talk (and bite his hand).However, it quickly became clear that it was just babbling.
It claimed it was ""teaching"", but all the dog would say was ""ant on mat.
mat on ant"" and other nonsensical things.
I could not see my kids learning anything from this dog.
It also only can have 2 things loaded at a time, a song from one paw and a story from the other.
New information seems to delete the old information, and there are few controls for parents to adjust what is on the dog (see below).We proceeded to try the software.
To be honest, the software was a tremendous let-down.
I work with computers for a living and have used plenty of kids software as well.
When we first opened this toy, I thought great, it's cute and very soft.
It moves nicely along with the songs and words.
But then we tried to operate it with the computer.
It took so long to load that we tried it on a different computer, with no better luck.
We finally gave up on it, and since paying for membership is not cheap, it's just as well.
My grandson, who is three, did not want to hear it after about three plays, and I can't blame him, the song and story included are distressingly annoying!
So we decided it's just a plush toy, looks cute on the shelf and his baby brother like to pet it, but that's it!
"First off, this dog is REALLY cute.
It's a nice size, cuddly and soft with a sweet face.
As a stuffed toy it ranks up there.As a learning toy?
Ehhhh, not so much.
It takes forever to get the entire thing hooked up and loaded on to your computer and downloaded to the dog, which means we the parent are doing all of it as it's not something you can give to your child to do.
And it takes  at least an hour of monotonous clicking and choosing different options, saying yes/no a zillion times, etc.
Once you do that, you actually need to sit with your child 99% of the time to help them interact.
I prefer to interact with my children through cooking, talking, playing family games together and mostly, going outside to play.
This is not one of those toys where they can spend a little quiet time on their own with their cute little puppy on a fun website, you have to be there guiding them along and that doesn't appeal to me at all.The sound quality is poor.
If you don't already speak and understand English very well, you will have a difficult time following what is going on.
I don't know if it's the voice they chose (a man's voice rather than a cute little puppy/boy type voice)or if the fur is muffling the sound, but it's just not that clear.
The pre-loaded tune ""Ant on Mat"" is cute and catchy and the way the dog dances and moves his head is adorable.
It's not too loud or annoying, though I'm fairly certain after a few hours in the car I might be rethinking that statement.
Also, you can only download one story/game to the toy at a time, so if you're going on a long trip, your child is going to quickly tire of the same story/song/game instead of having a choice of 3-4 at a time.
The only way to change games is to hook him back up to the computer and download another one (for a fee, of course)The biggest downfall is that you have to PAY for a subscription to keep the toy updated with new games and higher skill levels.
And it's not a cheap price either, we pay less for our monthly phone bill.
This would be an excellent toy if it wasn't for the subscription.... why can't it be more like leap frog you buy what you want but with this one in order for it to continue to work you have to have a subscription and how many parents these days can afford to pay for a subscription for a toy to continue to work?
I think if this had a different way of adding things it would be a better toy beause the little dog is really cute :)
"The web site associated with this otherwise cute toy is not easy to navigate, takes too long to ""earn"" items to download to the dog, and is very costly.
I will not continue my free trial to the $25 for 3 months.
My daughter has more fun on free sites on the computer that teach the same basics.I was hoping this was a modern day Teddy Ruxpin, but have been horribly disappointed.
I would not purchase this."
"Here's the thing: people don't really like buying toys that they have to *subscribe* to.
It's one thing for a magazine or newspaper, but for something like a toy, even a supposedly educational one, that's really stretching things.
For starters, you want to take the toy out of the box, do whatever assembly is required (none, in this case, one plus of the Pup) and then let the kids play.
That's it.
Even with educational toys, that's what's expected.I've dealt with Leapfrog products (Leapster gaming system, Tag, and My Pal Violet) and found the set up relatively simple.
Many of their products have an online presence where you download elements to enhance the toy's direct value for your child.
When I opened up the Smarty Ants packaging, my disappointment was immediately and crushing - a PAID subscription, seriously?
Without it, the Pup functions in a generic state, singing songs to your child at what I would guess is about a 4 year old learning level, teaching words via phonics.Perusing the Smarty Ants website, I'm not encouraged by what I see.
Rather than toy-based activities, your subscription gets you access to some songs that the Pup will sing along with an online environment for your child to access.
I don't know about any of you, but I'm trying to encourage my kids to just *play*, not sit on the computer.
They're going to do plenty of that when they get older.
Now's the time for them to be doing things, not sitting on the computer.With Leapster products, you download content for your toy, unplug, and they go play AND learn.
Not so with the Smarty Ants Pup.
I really don't know what the dog has to do with anything, actually - it's more like a little door prize, almost a trick to get you to log in to their site, and there is where the actually ""stuff"" is.
I don't know, maybe I sound bitter, but I feel like this is a bit of a cheat.
Cute puppy, some so-so songs (which do grow grating very quickly,) and then they jab you with a subscription the value of which is mostly for online content.
"Yes, the robotic dog is adorable and his test mode is almost worth the price!
He is soft and cute and watching his mouth move intrigues the little ones.
However, after we get past that, it becomes a problem.
Downloading his software to a MAC was impossible.
We could not get him to work on a MAC depsite our system meeting all the requirements listed on the box.
Not a problem, let me just download it to my pc.
Sigh.
Okay, another long task, but it will all be worth it, right?I enrolled my just turned 4 year old at the SmartyAnts site.
Again, this download takes some time.
It was fun to jump in the pool and catch the right letter!
However, how do you get out of the game?
There is no ""escaping"" the letter pool.
You have to continue on to see how many you get right or wrong in order to continue.I thought that the SmartyAnts dog would read my child stories, but that's not really the case.
You have to work through each lesson and sort of ""earn"" the story.
For a child that is just learning, this makes it difficult.
They aren't going to earn that story right away.Cost?
