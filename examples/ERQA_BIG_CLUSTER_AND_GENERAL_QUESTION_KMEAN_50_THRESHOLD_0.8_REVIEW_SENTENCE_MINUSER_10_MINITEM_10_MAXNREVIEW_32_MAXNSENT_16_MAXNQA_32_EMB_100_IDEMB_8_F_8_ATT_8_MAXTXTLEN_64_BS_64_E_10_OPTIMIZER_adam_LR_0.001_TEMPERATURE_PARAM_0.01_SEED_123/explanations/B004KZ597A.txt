The different level instructions turned out to be key for the enjoyment of my son and yet my nieces and nephews could play to.
We tried Candyland and even dreidel and although he liked looking at and messing around with the game parts, he did not grasp any of the concepts associated with gaming.Then a friend with a boy about the same age recommended Colorama, and wow it has been total perfection.
My 4yo son already knows his colors and shapes, so it was less of a challenge than it could have been (I'll be interested to see how it helps with my second child), though he did have fun finding where all the pieces went.
"I gave the Colorama game to my cousin for her four-year-old, and I am happy to say that he loves this game and asks repeatedly to play it.

Reviews:
"This is a very simple color and shape matching game.
You start the game with all the parts on the board, roll the dice and match the color and shape you've rolled to one of the parts on the game board.I suggest getting a zip top bag for holding all the small parts and dice.
It all fits back into the box just fine, but a gallon sized bag will hold the whole thing if you happen to crush or lose the box.
It's helpful for traveling with the game as well.There's really no ""winner"", as with most Ravensburger games, so it's mainly about teaching.
The parts are small so if you're kiddo is still putting things in their mouths this is not a game to let them play by themselves.I like that they promote it as a way to learn game play.
That's been a big component of our play, beyond the color and shape matching, that I've been enjoying.
It's fun to watch my youngest learn how a game is played with taking turns, etc.I do agree with another reviewer that the game gets really slow when you're trying to make a match.
That's when Mom took over and just called out parts to find though.
Made it a lot quicker."
When I first received this toy, I was underwhelmed.
There's not much to it, but to my surprise, my 2.5 y/o daughter really enjoyed playing with it.
In short, the game has 4 or so different game pieces (each being a different color and shape), and the goal is to place each piece in right corresponding board tile space.
It obviously teaches colors, color recognition, coordination, shapes and so on.
Its probably not a game that a child would enjoy repeatedly for a long period, but it did give her several days of fun, and that's about all I can ask at this stage.
This turned out to be a fun game that includes instructions for different level of difficulty depending on the age of the child.
The different level instructions turned out to be key for the enjoyment of my son and yet my nieces and nephews could play to.
The pieces were bright and fit easily in the corresponding space.
A good quality game.Happy Shopping!
This game is best for 3 to 4 year olds.
It would help if an adult or a patient older sibling can help facilitate the gameplay.
There are variations, but it's basically a way to practice taking turns while getting familiarized with colors and shapes.
The bugaboos of the game are that the dice have a joker which allows you to pick any piece, and the white on the colored die means you have to skip your turn - it's important to learn skipping turns too.It is fun to see a child react delightfully after getting the pieces, but kids 5 and up would be bored.
Also, there are 40 pieces to pick up.
That's at least 40 rolls total, so it can get long.
Due to the simplicity of the game, maybe the gameboard should have contained smaller number of pieces to match a younger child's attention span.The board itself is made of cardboard like those jigsaw puzzles contained within a cardboard frame and backing.
I can see the board getting beaten up if not cared for.
The game can be played by one like solitaire, but that's 40 dice roll for one child and can be a tough task to complete.For at least 2 preschoolers, this is a fun game.
I recommend minimal supervision, or you can join in the gameplay if you want.
First, this is a great game for the whole family.
Success does not depend on any skills, but on sheer luck in rolling the dices.
This way, everybody can win - which in our family usually is the youngest, our four year old son.The rules are easy to comprehend and the objective of the game is easy to understand.
It took our son just a few moments to grasp the rules and how to play.
Learning how to loose on the other hand ... well, I have to say that he takes it better than his six years old sister.The manual gives you three different levels of difficulty to play, so you can adjust it easily to make it playable for smaller kids.The rules are very simple: you load the board with the playing pieces, 2 each of every shape and color, then you roll the dices (one for the color and one for the shape), and remove one piece that represents the color and shape the dices show from the board.
The player with the most pieces at the end wins.Playing time for one round is about 15-20 minutes, which is perfect for a quick game before dinner.
The only gripe I have with this game, and this is a somewhat serious flaw in my point of view, is that if you play by the rules, once you are down to 4 or 5 pieces on the board, it gets very tedious and boring to hit the right combination with the dices to clear them out eventually.
We invented our own rule how to end the game: if there is the same number of pieces left as players at the table, then we end the game.
There are certainly numerous other scenarios one could come up with to bring this game to a good end, and not having to go through the trouble of waiting until the last piece has been cleared.The board itself is made out of sturdy cardboard, the playing pieces are made out of plastic, the dice are wooden.
When treated decently, this game should last a few years - and really, since there are no moving parts or delicate tolerances involved, this shouldn't be a problem at all.All in all, our family really likes this game and if I could, I would give 4.5 stars.
But since ending the game can become rather bothersome, and this is a flaw the designers should have thought of, I can't give 5 stars.
So 4 stars it is ...
(I received this product free in exchange for an honest review)I was looking for a game that siblings could play with a younger child.
This fit the bill.
It can be difficult to find something that an age range of 6 years can play together.
It doesn't last all day, mind you, but 30 minutes or so of kids playing together is success in my book.
We had tried a few other board games with my little boy starting when he was almost 3 yrs old, and he just didn't get it at all.
We tried Candyland and even dreidel and although he liked looking at and messing around with the game parts, he did not grasp any of the concepts associated with gaming.Then a friend with a boy about the same age recommended Colorama, and wow it has been total perfection.
My little boy loves to play this game and it has taught him about dice-rolling and taking turns and even some strategy.Although my boy already knew his colors and shapes before playing this game, I do think this game would be good for teaching/reinforcing those concepts.The quality of the bits and the box and the board are all excellent, far surpassing the mass-market junkier preschool games you commonly find at big-box store toy aisles.
The concept is great too, as it allows for a couple of different variations and you can choose the simplest one for the littler children.This is a very very simple game and I don't expect interest in it to remain high forever, but it is really just an excellent introduction to basic gaming concepts and I look forward to what comes next.
A+.
Any Ravensburger game or puzzle is worth owning.
Their graphics and colors are always quality.
Their games are usually educational.
This is perfect for little ones to learn about colors, shapes and taking turns.
Ravensburger frequently does games for Discovery Toys.
I highly recommend any of their line.
great way for friends to teach small children the words for colors and shapes.
Kids love setting it up as much as playing, in fact they may prefer to use this as a puzzle to set up but please take the time and attention to teach them the shapes and colors with this great teaching toolIn the older days these parts might be considered a choking hazard for small children, so do not use it for toddlers.
The older child should be fine with proper supervision, around four and five years old.
Use this to teach colors and shapes and also the social skills for using it.really a lot of fun and educational too
This is a cute game to reinforce shapes and colors with my 2 1/2 year old.
The instructions include 4 levels of play depending on your child's skill level and level of attention at the moment.
Level 1 is basically using the game board as a puzzle and taking turns putting in all the pieces.
Not actually a game, but a nice activity where you can talk about the colors and shapes while you do it.
Level 2 you use just the color die and not the shape, taking turns rolling the die and putting the appropriate color on the board.
I can't imagine why I would do level 2, what is the point of ignoring the shapes?
Level 3 uses both color and shape dice to take turns putting the appropriate piece on the board and is actually a competetive game.
Level 4 is the same thing in reverse: you roll the dice to remove pieces from the board.Level 1 is perfect for my 2 1/2 year old.
She just doesn't have the attention or ability to grasp a competitive game yet.
Levels 3 and 4 are mildly amusing to my 5 year old, he will play a game or two with me sometimes, but this game is really best suited to 2-4 year olds.
It's a nice game, I'm looking forward to playing it more often when my daughter is 3 and 4.-------------------------Editing to add that my son, who is just about 6 now, took a big interest in this game over the weekend.
We had some guests visiting and he brought Colorama out and played it for 3 days straight.
He is old enough to catch the excitement of how difficult it is to roll the right combination on the dice to remove or add the last few pieces on the game board.
While I probably wouldn't buy it for a first grader, I see this game is going to interest my kids for a lot longer than I thought!
I got this for my preschool aged daughter.
The game is a little too simple for anybody above that age.
She knows her colors and enjoys playing it.
We like it because it teaches her about structured game play.
There are different variations that increase the complexity of the game and that should let it grow with her for a while.
Overall, Ravensburger makes high quality games and puzzles and Colorama is no different.
We have a handful of other Ravensburger products (games and puzzles) and this one ranks right up there quality-wise.
My 4yo son already knows his colors and shapes, so it was less of a challenge than it could have been (I'll be interested to see how it helps with my second child), though he did have fun finding where all the pieces went.
I like that there are more advanced levels (for instance, the second level is taking turns and rolling a die to remove a piece from the board) but that actually got a bit tedious and my son's attention drifted elsewhere...and I have yet to get him interested in trying the third level (rolling both dice and removing the corresponding piece).
So for now, it gets three stars.If you want to read all the rules, you can find them here: [...]
This game was a Christmas present for my 2 1/2 year old.
Though some aspects of the games are too difficult for her to grasp, she does understand colors and shapes at her age.
For this reason, we were able to put our own unique spin on the game.
The game does reinforce colors and shapes, and it certainly has potential for fun.
I am certain the pieces will be lost over time, but hopefully will not be consumed by smaller children.
I would recommend this game to others, even if you and your child do not follow the rules of the game.
What I like about this game is that you can play it with a mixed age group, and by mixed age, I mean a 2 yr old and a 5 yr old.
I can't imagine the game holding interest past age 5 unless the purpose is to include the little one, but my family has enjoyed playing it.
It's simple, fast, and does teach shapes and colors in an interactive way.
The chips are durable, but the board itself is just cardboard and probably won't hold up to too much wear and tear.
"I gave the Colorama game to my cousin for her four-year-old, and I am happy to say that he loves this game and asks repeatedly to play it.
Essentially, this game is designed to teach a young child shapes and colors, and it has several levels of play, from very basic to a bit more complex.
You can play by concentrating on shapes only, on colors only, or on a combination of the two.
The game is fun for kids, and if Brandon is any example, they will like it even if they already have a good grasp of shapes and colors.
Brandon has a younger brother, Joey, who  at 10 months is too young for the game,  but I can see this as a game the two could play together in about a year, with Brandon ""teaching"" Joey all the ins and outs of shapes and colors.
This game is a good use of time and money,  and I recommend it to anyone looking for a fun way to reinforce the basics of shapes and colors."
"I played this game with an almost-five-year-old, and he enjoyed it.
The game instructions have several variations to make it ""harder"" for older kids.
I liked that the shapes were not just simple ones: square, circle, triangle, but also hexagon and trapezoid.
As with any game about removing pieces from a board, it got a little boring toward the end because you have to roll just the right combination of color and shape in order to be able to make a move...but we survived.
Perhaps the game would be a tiny bit more fun for those closer to age three, but it will have at least some replay value for those under the age of seven."
This is a great game for children under 4 years of age.
It is bright and easy to play.
It is a game that helps them with their colors and their shapes.
It is fun and anyone can play it.
You can play a very simple version or add to the degree of difficulty a bit for more of a challenge.
It is well done and timeless for little ones.
I've also got Race to the Roof by Ravensburger which is an all-time favorite at the house.
This is a great color recognition game for younger children that keeps them engaged in challenged.
Sort of like Candy Land but not as insipid.
This game was more enjoyable for younger children than Bits but also fun for older children and adults.
The board and the tiles make for a more eye-catching game, and it helps, as do many Ravensburger games, with strategy, comprehension, spatial awareness, and geometry.
We loved it.
This a really good game for pre-schoolers just learning how to play board games because the rules are easy.
They learn how to roll dice and take turns.
With four different levels of play, the game has replay value.
My 4-year old grandson likes to play this game with his 11-year old sister, so it's not boring for older kids.
The game board is sturdy and even though there are lots of pieces, they are big and not easily lost.
This game is a great reinforcement for pre-schoolers who are learning shapes and colors.
Colorama has many advantages:1) It's easy to teach.
I sat down with my 5 and 6 year olds for 5 minutes and taught them to play.
They needed no further help from me.2) With 3 levels of play, it's surprisingly fun for older kids.
My 6 year old loves it, even though she knows her colors and shapes.
Using 2 dice to match color AND shape and counting pieces to determine a winner at the end of the game make it fun for her.
I'd guess this game would be most fun for 3-7 year olds.3) It's a great tool for teaching shapes and colors to younger children.
Besides Candyland, this is the only game my 3 year old will play.
Again, because of the 3 levels of play, we can only use one colored dice and pick a shape of that color.
He already knows his colors and can concentrate learning the different shapes.I'd highly recommend this to parents of young children and for beginning home schoolers.
It's an effective way to teach colors and fun too.
My 2yo has a burgeoning interest inpuzzlesandMemory-style games but has struggled with actual board games likeCandy Land, which are still a little too old for her.
Colorama is the perfect gap-fill.Well-designed with four level-variants, the game goes from a simple everybody-wins matching game (of color or shape) to a more multifaceted team-play game.
And setting up the board, which involves putting the colored shapes in their respective holes, is just as much fun for her as actually playing.
This is also a great game to have tucked away for a rainy-day playdate, since it takes only minutes for newcomers to learn the rules.The pieces and board are pretty durable and well-constructed (especially by board game standards), and for the price it's a great value.
"I received this through Amazon Vine with the intent to play it with my four-year-old.
She loves it!
I especially appreciate that the game offers three different ways to play, each way slightly more difficult than the previous.
The object if fairly simple: you role the dice and pick out the correlating shape and color.
It is truly a game of chance more than anything, though one die has a ""lose a turn"" side and the other a ""joker,"" and these two features are really the only way to gain an advantage and win.
In its simplest playing format, you roll just one die and choose any shape that matches the color (or at least that's how we interpreted the directions).The pieces are a light plastic and the board seems a little thin, so it doesn't seem incredibly durable, but if properly cared for I see no reason why this game can't last.My daughter had a blast showing off her shapes and colors knowledge, and I can honestly say the game moves quickly enough to make it enjoyable for both the children and the parents.
I highly recommend this simple, educational, fun game."
The Ravensburger Colorama game is fun to play with my 4-yr-old granddaughter.
She enjoys matching the shapes to the game board and has become quite adept at doing so.
The game has variations that increase the difficulty.
The basic variation has you matching the colors, then the shapes, then the shapes and colors, and so on.
There are any number of ways you could devise yourself to play this game.The playing pieces are sturdy plastic and the game board is laminated cardboard, just like other board games.
The pieces are small, so be sure to keep them away from any child that might be young enough to swallow them!The game is rated for ages 3+, but I think that a child older than 5 would get bored with this game rather quickly.
However, my 4-yr-old still loves it and she's played it a thousand times already.
This is a well made product.
The pieces and board are durable and easy to clean.
I thought it might be a bit more complex than it is, but it's pretty basic.
I would say it would be good for 2- 4 years old rather than three and up.
"Colorama is a good first board game for little ones.
It's basically a game of matching shapes and colors.
The player rolls two dice.
One indicates a color.
The other shows a shape.
The child then has to locate a piece that matches both color and shape.
For a three-year-old, the game is challenging and fun.
It's a good game to play with a parent or a friend.There are four skill levels, so that when a child masters one level and it becomes too easy, he/she can ""graduate"" to the next, which offers greater challenge.Board games are great for rainy afternoons or long summer days.
This game can be played indoors and, when weather is too pleasant to stay inside, in the park.There is a warning on the box that there is a choking hazard for children under 36 months.
Some kids like to put pretty or interesting things in their mouths, so be diligent when your child is playing this game.
There are 42 game pieces -- 40 shape pieces, 2 dice -- so there might be a tendency to ""taste"" a piece or two.
You know your child, so if this isn't a problem, fine.
If it is, maybe this game is not for him/her.In the era of electronic games and toys, Colorama is a retro-type game that teaches as it amuses and occupies young ones.
It is reasonably priced and makes for a neat holiday or birthday present."
"I waited until Christmas Eve when my grandchildren were here, to break out the Colorama game.
Over the course of 2 days we played the game 4 times.
The game can be adapted to different skill levels.
Ravensburger recommends it for ages ""3 & up"".
It's true that it can be played at different levels but while the 6 year old had fun playing the game with her cousins & Nana, she's long past the age where Colorama would be considered remotely educational for her.
On the most basic level, the 3 year old had to really concentrate when it was her turn to select the shape & color to place on the board.
It stretched her little mind!
She can't say, ""Trapezoid"", but she's now able to point to one!
The colors are bright & bold.
It has one feature that I love to see in children's games: it's noncompetitive!
I would highly recommend it for preschool age children.
I wouldn't advise anyone to purchase it for an older child."
