It was adorable (he's 4yrs and mildly autistic)!Well, I got it out of the box, and the instructions were a little confusing (then again, I'm easily confused), but I figured it out and got it together.

"My 4 year old nephew was impressed by the flashy packaging and he's familiar with ""The Adventures of Chuck and Friends"" on Hub channel.
At the end of the track, Tonka did nothing more than cover up the third track slot with a supposed ""mechanic"" panel that features a sticker with tools on it.
At first glance, it looks like a young child's dream:  bright colors, flashy packaging, and a cool truck included.

Reviews:
Picked this up for my 2-year-old girl, and she and I have a blast with it.
She absolutely loved it when I first gave it to her, dragging it out every night to have races across the kitchen floor.
The Tonka Chuck that comes with it is cute and fits perfectly on the racing platform, but because we don't have any other Tonka Chuck figures, we supplement with a few Hot Wheels cars that sort of work.
She yells in delight when the cars run down the track and zip across the kitchen floor.Unfortunately, there's not much more to the set than that, and she plays with it in shorter sessions each time she takes it out.
The first several nights, we would race for a half hour at a time, but now I'm lucky if she races three times before she's ready to move on to a different toy.
(And it's not some boy/girl thing - she's a very competitive kid who will compete with me on anything from running down a hill to who will drink milk faster.
)Cute, simple idea, and it's fun for a little while.
"This racing tower was pretty easy to put together.
While not completely intuitive, I just needed to look at the pictures and had the tower together in less than 10 minutes.
All the pieces simply snapped together and the tower was relatively study.A four and a six year old played with the tower and they really enjoyed it.
It held their attention pretty well.
There are a couple of things that keep me from giving this 5 stars.
The first is that the kit comes with only one car.
While I understand the desire to encourage parents to buy additional cars - it is kind of hard to have a ""race"" when there is just one car included.
Because of this, my kids ended up using other cars they have for racing (i.e.
hot wheels).
The tower worked okay with those substitutes - so instead of encouraging me to buy additional Tonka cars because of how cool they are racing each other, I now know that I don't need an actual Tonka car and can simply use many of the seemingly thousands of toy cars we already have.The sound effect is fun for a little while, but my kids ended up turning it off as it didn't seem to coordinate with racing.
The same with the flag at the end.
The flag going up at the end of the race isn't the best way to indicated which car won since the cars go so fast as there is only so much track.While the kids really enjoyed playing with the tower - they haven't asked for it when it is away.
It is a great size for racing, but takes up a bit too much room to just keep it out all the time.I would probably look at this toy more for the younger age ranges (2 - 4) because my kids kept trying to find ways to make it faster, longer, or enhance it in one way or another.
I can definitely imagine a 2 or 3 year old thinking this is the best thing since sliced bread though.
But be warned - you will need another car that will fit in order for it to be a true race since only one car comes in the pack.
The cars need to be of equal size as well."
My three year-old son loves trucks, so this seemed like a natural fit for him.
It's a cute little toy, fairly easy to assemble, and is compatible with his other Chuck trucks.
(This Racing Tower comes with a die-cast metal truck, which I'm really not too crazy about.
Little boys throw things, and the old softer plastic trucks were more family-friendly.)
As I said, the tower and track assemble pretty easily, and the track is held together with a very cheap-looking set of snap holders, but they're deceptively durable....My Son, despite VERY rough play, has yet to disconnect any of the track assemblys.
We've had a lot of fun racing, with no end in sight.
There's really not much to the toy, but my Son doesn't seem to mind at all.
You could do a lot worse for your little race-fans.
My youngest son loves Tonka Chuck.
We have several Chuck toys.
My sons really likes this set too.
It includes a nice die-cast Chuck that sells for $5 by it-self when purchased separately.The set is nice but as a parent, it's annoying that race sets are sold with only one vehicle so you know you're going to have to buy additional vehicles.
That has almost become a standard in toys, you only get enough to get you started then you have buy additional items.
The upside is that the vehicles are only around $5.We've just been using other die-cast vehicles that we already own with the track.
I think that's what my son loves anyway; he likes anything that makes a ramp so he can roll cars down it.
It's a simple set unlike some of our Hot Wheels sets so it's easy to set-up and easy to play with so it's good for younger children.My son is 4 and loves the set.
I would recommend for those probably 3 - 7.
"My 4 year old nephew was impressed by the flashy packaging and he's familiar with ""The Adventures of Chuck and Friends"" on Hub channel.
First thing he asked was, ""Where (are) Chuck's friends???
""Likes:>Easily assembled by uncle (me).>Kids can also use Hotwheels, Matchbox, or any other toy vehicles that will fit on the tracks.>Underlying educational value that other parents may not have noticed:  The tracks are deliberately set at different levels so kids may learn that the vehicle at the highest track (more potential energy) will almost always finish first.
My nephew also raced/experimented with different sized/weight die-cast and plastic toy vehicles to see what happens.
Surprise!
It's a learning experience.>My nephew enjoys hearing Chuck yell out (when the start race button is pressed), ""Vroom, vroom!
Woohoo!
Yeehaa!
Yeaahhh, Chuck!
"", etc.Dislikes:>How the heck does a child race one vehicle?
Chuck's Friends, Biggs the Monster truck, Boomer the Fire Truck, Rowdy the Garbage Truck, Soku the Cruiser, etc.
are all available separately.
Thanks, Tonka/Hasbro, now my nephew want the rest of Chuck's Friends to complete his collection.>The toy was clearly designed for three tracks but the lowest level was reconfigured into the ""Winner's stand"".>$24.99 for this ""Tower Racin' Speedway"" is reasonable but purchasing all of Chuck's Friends/vehicles will quickly add up to a large bill for dad (bro).>Kids are constantly bombarded by countless flashy cartoons, video games, movies, etc.
so the long term appeal of this ""conventional"" toy is questionable.Bottom Line:A simple, electronically activated race track that's compatible with similarly sized toy vehicles.
Children ages 3+ may also learn something about track height/potential energy and weight on toy vehicles' speed down the track.
Kids may grow tired of this toy in a short time after the novelty wears off."
"The Tonka Chuck Tower Racing toy proved to be terrific fun for my two-year old grandson.
That is, he found it terrific fun for the first fifteen minutes of play.
However, he rapidly lost interest in the toy once he had raced his all Matchbox cars and Little People cars down the ramps.The Tonka Chuck Tower Racing toy is made of flexible plastic; it is light weight and the pieces are smoothly finished.
One need not be concerned with a little one getting cut on rough plastic seams.
The toy is easy to assemble; placing the stickers is the most time-consuming task associated with the assembly.
At 36"" long, the footprint is a bit large.
However, the tower portion makes a base so that the toy can rest on the tower; this allows the toy to be stored in a closet, against the wall with the ramps pointed upward, and requires significantly less floor space.The Tonka Chuck Tower Racing toy comes with only one vehicle; since one usually races at least two vehicles, this is a somewhat obvious marketing ploy.
We found that Matchbox cars and those from the Fisher-Price Little People Stand n' Play Rampway worked just as well for racing on the Tonka Chuck Tower Racing toy and so were able to avoid purchasing additional vehicles.If you are looking for a toy that will hold your child's interest for a short time, you may want to consider the Tonka Chuck Tower Racing toy.
However, I would not recommend spending more than $20 this item."
It took me about 15 minutes to put this thing together and about 30 seconds for my son to take it back apart.
The toy is so flimsy it wont even stand up on a carpet surface.
The truck launches off the racing pad when they push the button and there are sound effects, a neat idea, but pointless if the toy is this cheaply made.
The toy is large and falls apart with minimal use.
Also, why isn't their a third track?
It makes no sense to have space for three tracks but to only include two tracks and one truck.
A waste of money.
This looked to be a great idea as my boys love to race cars and they also love the Chuck trucks.
The idea of putting both together sounded really great.
The overall product was found to be a little lacking though.
They could have added more than one vehicle so you could actually race.
Also there is a spot for a third track but not one included( i guess to save money or something).
I have four boys (3 of which are old enough to play with toy) and they really could have used the 3rd track to make it lots more fun.
Overall though it is a very durable track that is lots of fun if you supply more vehicles to it and only have one or two children.
all in all a great toy!
i taught my 2 1/2 yr old to set this up and he loves it.. i wish the track was longer but all in all a great toy.not much to say about it but its a great value.
the only educational part of it is helping his motor skills with assembly.
I originally selected this toy because I was lead to believe that it was part of the Tonka Chuck Truck series which includes the larger plastic toys made for younger children.
Unfortunately the track is designed for a smaller diecast toy (and it only includes one).
This was really my largest gripe with the toy because I was hoping to have something that was compatible with my existing stable of Tonka Chuck Trucks.In terms of construction the track is durable and easy to set up.
I did find that my daughter (who is 2.5 years old) showed little interest in playing with the smaller truck that the track requires.
Plan on buying at least one other truck, otherwise there won't be much racing action going on.This is a toy that my kids will likely grow into, but the 18+ month age recommendation misses the mark.
It's simply not designed with the margin of error that allows kids still developing fine motor skills to have fun.
Good starter set for a race track.
Here's the rub--it only includes one truck and two tracks.
For $20 it ought to include 3 tracks and at least 2 trucks.
"My son knows Chuck only from commercials and the occasional television program that he catches while visiting friends who have the Hub channel.
Despite this, he was very excited to receive the Tonka Chuck Tower Racing set.
At first glance, it looks like a young child's dream:  bright colors, flashy packaging, and a cool truck included.
However, crack open the package and you find a race set that looks eerily similar toTonka Wheel Pals Triple Track Tower.
Both include the ""winner"" activated flag and make sounds (although the sounds differ), and both even have a very similar looking checkered-flag (just swap out the logo between the flags on the sticker).
Both sets are reasonably sturdy and safe for a child to handle as well, but that's where the similarities end.The Chuck Tower set comes with only two tracks.
The Wheel Pals set features three tracks.
On the Chuck set, the section where the third track should go is conveniently covered by a ""winner's"" platform at the ""start"" end of the track.
At the end of the track, Tonka did nothing more than cover up the third track slot with a supposed ""mechanic"" panel that features a sticker with tools on it.
Granted, the two tracks that come with the Chuck set are longer, but what's the point in having a three-track tower that only comes with two tracks?Also, and this is the biggest difference in my opinion, the Chuck set comes with only one truck to race with.
Of course, it's obvious Tonka did this in order to make parents go out and buy more Chuck vehicles, but why didn't they include at least one more vehicle to race with?
The Wheel Pals set comes with three, yep, three cars to race with on the three, yes, I said three again, tracks!To top it all off, the Wheel Pals set is roughly $5 to $7 cheaper than the Chuck set depending on where you buy it!
You get more vehicles and all three tracks for less money, which means you are only paying the extra bucks for Chuck's name on the box!While I completely understand marketing ploys and the pressure to increase profits in today's economy, I cannot see the point in shortchanging parents or children with a toy that is obviously built for three tracks and three vehicles but only comes with two tracks and one vehicle.
Save your money, folks, and get the Wheel Pals set instead!"
"This is a fun toy with some quality issues.
My toddler really enjoys the small Chuck trucks, and was thrilled to receive the racing ramps.
The set has been a lot of fun for him, and continues to be a favorite after a couple of weeks of use.However, the set generally seems to be ""fair"" quality - not horrible, but not good.
Issues I've noted include- Only one car is included for a set that is clearly intended to race two cars.
It's not a problem for us since we already had a few Chuck trucks, but seems designed to require you to buy more.
Furthermore, a couple of the trucks we did have (same brand/style/size) have ""monster"" style wheels which are too wide to fit down the ramps.- It looks pretty clear (especially to the adult putting it together) that the set was designed to have three ramps and has been changed to include just two.
It comes with gray pieces to cover the empty slots, but they don't stay in place well.- Ramps will need to be reattached or put back together from time to time.- The ""go"" button often launches just one of the vehicles rather than both.I do like that the Chuck truck included is die cast and seems to be an upgrade from a recent plastic version that I was familiar with.
I also like that there are three slots to store trucks on the back of the stand.
The sounds that are triggered when you hit the ""go"" button is fun and not too annoying.Amazon's site currently recommends 18 months and up, while Tonka's site and the box specify 3 years and up.
I don't know about safety issues, but children under three could definitely enjoy this."
"I got this for my god sons to play with when they come over, and the interesting thing is, I had it sitting in the box next to the entryway of my apartment, and after about 5minutes, the eldest one walks up to me with a large box in his hands and I'm like ""Go put that back...""  Until I realize its this toy!
lol  He brought it me to open so he could play with it!
It was adorable (he's 4yrs and mildly autistic)!Well, I got it out of the box, and the instructions were a little confusing (then again, I'm easily confused), but I figured it out and got it together.
Both him and his brother played with it off and on for the duration of their visit (about 2hrs), so I'd say its a pretty awesome toy to occupy younger children.
:DThe one thing I don't like about it is that it only comes with one car, even though there are two tracks (which is obviously designed so you go out and buy my cars so you can actually race them).
But since this is essentially a hot wheels track for younger children, I just pulled out my hubby's old hot wheels and raced them the truck that came with it with those, and they enjoyed it just fine.
:)This toy kept them amused for a long time, and its not a super high tech toy, so it does require more imagination than some other modern toys, which I like, so overall, I'd say its a worth while toy for younger children.God Bless ~Amy"
My two boys love race tracks and they usually love Tonka's Chuck products, but unfortunately that wasn't the case with the Tonka Chuck Tower Racing Track.
This racetrack is very simplistic as it only has two tracks that you snap together for about a 3 foot incline and it only comes with one car.
It was very easy to put together and my 6 year old and 4 year old had fun with the track when they first got it, but they quickly became bored.
They claimed it was more for babies!Like other reviewers, I thought it was a little weird that there's room for a third track, but it only comes with a grey plastic cover to block it off.
My box did have decorative stickers and the sound effects were a nice addition.Because of the length, it is hard to store, but I must say it's very durable, as my boys have bent this in ways you can only imagine.Overall, I do think some younger boys would enjoy this, but with other tracks on the market that offer much more, it might be better to look into those.
"This will be a birthday gift for a 4-year-old boy.
The box looks substantial---it will make an impressive gift in terms of appearance.
However, there are two tracks, so you can race the truck(s), BUT ONLY ONE TRUCK IS INCLUDED!
This means you'll have to buy another truck and/or take your chances that something on hand will fit on the track (the box warns that it may not).You will also need to buy batteries.
This toy is supposed to make ""truck"" noises, but they've actually recorded a little boy making his own brmm brmm noises and yelling things like ""Whew!""
and ""Whooo-hooo!""
and ""Heeeeere's Chuck!""
Pretty silly, actually.If you are willing to spend the time and $ to buy the batteries and an extra truck, then this will probably be a fun toy.
But it would have been a heck of a lot better to just include them.
3 stars."
"These things always look so exciting on the commercials; however, the ""fun"" factor is always short-lived (if they don't break before then).
This product is no exception.
It reminds me of the many different HOT WHEELS tracks/activity sets we have purchased over the years.
Unfortunately, these types of toys are not made to last.
In addition, there is only a very limited number of things you can do on the tracks, car goes up ... car comes down.
If your child enjoys those kinds of toys, then he/she will certainly enjoy this one.
If, however, your child enjoys toys that are more flexible (and can do more), then this toy probably won't be played with past the first week.
Yes, I speak from experience!As far as quality, it is similar to those infamous HOT WHEELS tracks.
This set, however, does stay together better than many of the Hot Wheels tracks (and isn't constantly falling apart).
In addition, the car moves more easily on the tracks than many of the comparable HOT WHEELS tracks."
This product is fun for the little use you get out of it.
It's not a full product, as others have mentioned.
It's missing all of the components, making it difficult to RACE...which seems to be the purpose of the product.
If you had all of the components for the current price, it might be worth it.
But with only about 1/3 of the product in it, it's DEFINITELY not worth the price.
"This is a nice little set for younger ones.
Really, what kid doesn't like cars and trucks with little faces on them!
It comes with starter batteries[2 AA's] but, though racing is featured prominently on packaging... there is only one little truck of die cast metal and plastic construction provided.
If your child loves the ""Cars"" characters in a particular way, Tonka's ""Chuck the Dump Truck"" may not quite satisfy... but most little guys may hardly notice.
There is a button on the base which provides fun audio expressions to enhance the fun.I think 5+ years will want more than this has to offer, but it is fine for 3 or 4.
It is not excellent in construction or execution... but it is OK for a little indoor fun.
:)"
I don't know anything about toy design but after assembling this toy and having my kids play with it I can imagine how the process went.
It is obvious from the design that it was supposed to be for 3 tracks (not two) and I suspect the intent was to include 3 cars as well.
Somewhere in the journey from design to manufacture to marketing the 3rd track was eliminated in favor of some plastic cover-ups to hide the unused starting and ending areas.
The inclusion of a single car is interesting for a race set as well, but I suppose the thought was that most kids have at least one car of some sort which can be used to race against.
I am certain these changes significantly lowered the production cost but I suspect the original designer was not pleased...So, despite the compromises how much fun is this toy?
I got this since my kids and I had recently participated in Pinewood Derby and I thought this might be a similar experience.
Unfortunately, this toy leaves a lot to be desired.
My son was real excited as I put it together but after about 10 minutes he lost interest.
He did, however, get interested in contributing to this review and I will add some of his comments below as an edit once I get his final thoughts.I'm afraid I can't recommend this toy, though kids at the lower end of the targeted age range (3) might find it fun for a time.
This Tonka Chuck Tower Racing is not easy to put together for little ones.
It only comes with 1 car, you MUST take it apart to store it and it's quite flimsy.
It does have neat sounds  that little ones will like, but other than that, I would not recommend this toy...
"This racing track is actually a good bit of fun - or at least it would be if it came with all the pieces.
For $25 you only get half the product.
Which is to say, two tracks and one car.
If it had two cars, it would be much better.
If it had all three tracks and three cars, it may actually be worth the asking price.
This is a cute simple toy, but hey, kids like simple toys.
Just be warned that if you buy it, be prepared to end up spending another $20 or so on the rest of the pieces.Here's my pros and cons:PROS:- The lengthy track leads to an exciting finish.
It is especially thrilling to see the flag shoot up when the winning car passes the finish line.- Sound effects are a nice bonus.
To start the race you press a button on the side which emits a nice sound effect, and also pushes the cars forward so they all start at the same time.
I think this is especially nice!- Fairly easy to put together.CONS:- Hard to store.
When you want to put this track away you're dealing with a 3+ foot long mess.
Yes, you can take it apart to make for easy storage.
But, let's face it, who wants to play with a toy you have to assemble each time?
At my house we call those toys ""junk.
""- Expensive.
Assuming you buy the rest of the parts, we're dealing with a $50 slope for cars to slide down.
As every other parent reviewing before me has stated I too am befuddled on why they would not include a second vehicle.
You cannot 'race' and truly get the feeling without the second racer.
I also understand that this is the gimmick that toy makers/producers employ in getting poor unsuspecting parents to reach for the toy and realize as their child is screaming to open it that they goofed and didn't purchase any 'additional accessories'.Maybe if toymakers were forced to stay in a room all day with a child that is having a tantrum because 'additional accessories' were not included then they would stop MAKING THESE HORRIBLE DECISIONS.
I understand regarding extras and more characters etc.
but not when this is a Tonka Chuck Tower RACING Tower.
The only point of this game is to... you guessed it, RACE.
They should have included another vehicle.
I feel they didn't because it is a junky garbage pile toy.My son whom is five years old was excited by the packaging.
Dad built while son anticipated.
Son slapped on the stickers and Dad realized that the tracks were not interchangeable.
Dad also realized that one track was longer and because of the elevation would always 'win'.
Dad also came to realize that there was a slot for a third track but it couldn't snap on.
Son thoroughly enjoyed it for 5 minutes and then wanted to race.
We were stumped.
We pulled out a basket filled with various toy vehicles including Hot Wheels.
None of the types would slide down the plastic ramp properly.
