Top sentence(s):
Only the game ramps are poorly made; they are constructed of a light-weight, flimsy plastic.
All the while ""drawing"" more tiles and placing them on our board in such a manner to both not mess up the grid pattern you're currently working on and also not building your tile grid up to the top of the tray (""game over for you!)
Our entire family got frustrated with this game, ages ranging from kindergartner to adult.
"BITS is the fourth Ravensburger game I've picked up in the past few months.
Those are usually worth one point each.Like other Ravensburger products, BITS - with one exception - is very well made.

Reviews:
We love Bits!
Our family had been playing it every night since we got it.
It is a very enjoyable game!Up to four players can enjoy this fast game with durable pieces and intelligent progression.
Like the traditional Tetris, we must organize the tiles into well fitting shapes, and likeBlokus Classics Gamewe are the ones who make them connect--or not.
Each player has his own raised tray where he places the double tiles so as to make shapes and earn points.
The type and color of shapes vary from game to game and there are always four levels of points-earning challenges to grab all of the cells in your brain!A wonderful family game, simple to learn, easy to teach, quick to play.
Box and pieces are super durable and nice to handle.
A winner!
Let me start off by saying I have never played a game like this before.
It is a lot like Tetris in a board game form.
It is fun to play solo or with others, I recommend this for anyone looking for a new kind of board game.
The first thing I noticed is that this game's first language is NOT English!
As with most instructions, it comes in several languages so those of us that need English can learn how to play this game.The next thing I noticed is the box itself.
Most game boxes are just colored cardboard but this box has a plasticized coating.
I believe this will help the box to last longer when being handled.Bits is similar to Tetris but done with game tiles and a small board.
It can be played solo or with up to four players.
The age range says 8-99 but I think it would be better off for teens and up.
It needs concentration and patience and I don't know many eight-year-olds with patience!
"How often have we heard ""fun for the entire family""?
How often is it actually true?
Not often enough.
It's pretty hard to find something to please all ages.
But this game does that and more.
I played with my 9 and 13 year old.
I'm older than the hills.
We all loved it.The basic concept is you pick a card that shows you a shape and tells you how many points it's worth.
One by one the players get colored tiles and place the on their game board, trying to create the same shape with adjacent colors.
That's round one.
In round two you add in a new shape that can give you points.
In round three you still have the first two, but now you add in a penalty shape.
You'll lose a certain number of points for every instance you create of the penalty shape.If it sounds confusing, it's not.
We had the game up and running in no time.
We played and got the hang of it quickly.
And all of us had a great time.
After having purchased and played a fair number of Ravensburger games, I can say this for them: they require thought.
These are not mindless games of chance, but games that encourage careful thought and strategy, and this game is no exception.
Those of you who are Tetris fans from way back will probably enjoy this game, and it also strikes me as a good choice for introducing kids to some geometric concepts.The game consists of three rounds, with a new challenge introduced in each round.
In round one, you flip a card, which is divided into two sides.
On one, you have the challenge of creating a specific geometric shape with your colored tiles, which earns you two points.
You can make this shape as many times as you are able, in any color you like, and you will earn two points for each successful completion.
On the other side are a variety of shapes that you may make for one point.
Again, you can make them as many times as you're able in as many colors as you like.Once the challenge is revealed, players take turns flipping over a set of cards that depict colored tiles.
For instance, if a player flips the card that shows a double red tile, each player takes their double red tile, places it at the top of their board either vertically or horizontally (up to the player) and then slide that tile down until it either hits the bottom or comes to rest on top of another tile.
Unlike Tetris, there is no sliding the tile sideways, so you have to be careful to position your tiles in a way that maximizes your space.
Players use the tiles to construct shapes or to separate a shape of one color from another in a differing color.In round two, another challenge is introduced and, this time, players attempt to make a shape in one particular color for a two point reward.
However, players now have the choice of creating this round two shape AND any of the shapes from round one, so this provides a bit more flexibility in gameplay.Round three is where a twist is introduced: a tile depicting a shape that will cause players to lose two points from their round score.
Now, you not only have to try to make the shapes from rounds one and two, you have to do so while carefully planning your tile placement so as not to end up making the forbidden shape and hurting your score.
This can become extremely challenging, requiring your mind to go in different strategic directions.At the end of each round, players total up their points and keep a running tally.
The object is to have the most points at the end of the game.
This makes the game competitive, but it's also possible to play the game by yourself, since each player is in control of his or her own board.As with other Ravensburger games, this one is very well constructed.
"BITS is a puzzle game, where you fit shaped pieces into a grid to form shapes and score points.
If your family likes puzzle games like Blokus or Qwirkle, you'll probably like this one, too.What we like:* It's a puzzle game.
* Logic will get you the best score, but luck plays a role.
* It can be played non-competitively.
Everyone tries to get the highest score they can, but you aren't actively working against each other.
* You can play for 10-20 minutes, or as long as you want.
* It's easy to explain to new players.What could be better:* The directions weren't as clear as they could be.
(But by the second round of play, everyone easily ""got it"".)"
"BITS is a game that requires patience to learn, but once you grasp the basic concept is not difficult to play.
It is, however, a game that requires some thought and strategizing to play correctly; it is not a game for casual, inattentive players.
I particularly liked that the game could be played as a type of ""solitary,"" but was also suitable for up to four players.Instructions for BITS are provided in multiple languages; those written in English start on page 13 of the instruction book.
I began by separating all the pieces and grouping them as they were laid out in the booklet.
You will notice that the playing tiles have one of four different symbols on their faces; separate these tiles into four groups so that all tiles in a group have the same symbol.I played BITS alone before attempting to bring in other players.
I followed the instructions, step-by-step, and puzzled out my questions as I played.
One person, initially playing BITS alone, helped reduce confusion which may occur when four different individuals try to learn something new at the same time.
Scoring takes some time as once you are unable to play a tile you must not only look for the higher point-value shape, but also count the number of other shapes using four of the same color tiles.
Those are usually worth one point each.Like other Ravensburger products, BITS - with one exception - is very well made.
A sturdy box contains all the game pieces.
Heavy cardboard game boards and playing cards, and rigid plastic tiles are used in the game.
They are nicely finished and should last through years of play.
Only the game ramps are poorly made; they are constructed of a light-weight, flimsy plastic.
The quality of the ramps would have been more consistent with the rest of BITS had a more sturdy plastic been used in their construction.It would have been helpful if a divided tray or separate storage bags had been provided for the small playing pieces.
I ended up using Ziploc sandwich bags and labeling them; this helped reduce set-up time as players did not have to sort through and separate a mass of small pieces.BITS is not a game for everyone; younger players, in particular, may find it frustrating.
However, if you enjoy puzzles, chess, bridge, or other activities requiring active thinking, you should enjoy BITS."
Well this was a big dissapointment.
The directions were written in a multitude of languages, with English near the end.
I don't know if the directions were lost in translation or if PhD's are required to understand them...but regardles even with muliples readings by people with Masters degrees, as well as kids with IQ's in at the genius level, did nothing to help us understand this game.
Maybe if you can figure out the rules it would be fun, but for us it just left us  So, I cannot recommend this game.
My kids at 5 and 6 are a bit young for this game, given the large number of pieces, and difficult to comprehend rules, but we played, and they did enjoy the simplified version we played.
There is a nugget of a good board game in there somewhere that anyone can play.
But for the casual board game player, especially with younger children it's a lot of work setting up, playing and storing the game with comparatively little reward.Build quality and overall craftsmanship is good.For the niche of people who love board games and have a competitive family to play with.
I am not familiar with FITS game which is the predecessor of this BITS game.The board and the tiles filling is like Tetris but the tiles dont zoom at you at an infinite speed.
The tiles in this game are colorful.Some of the tasks reward you points only if you maintain the color of the blocks.With the need for pattern matching, it is a good brain exercise for kids to improve their spatial skills and problem solving skills.It is not predictable.
With a positive as well as negative points system, not only will it teach kids to increase the number of patterns but also not to make the patterns which have negative points.
The scoring system with its plus and minus can make them adept at bookkeeping.
This game is DEFINITELY not geared for most 8 year olds.
The game is also not meant to induce much interaction of players.
It's a strategy game.
So this is, in my opinion, not the best family game.
This is  a game maybe for teens who like to play strategy games and are good at visualization as you have to visually plan out your future moves.The game itself is well made and study and will last a long time.
The directions are touted as easy to learn but I felt I had a little difficulty in picking it up.
I have read reviews that some people compare it to chess where you have a few rules to learn but the strategy is harder to master.
Perhaps that is somewhat accurate... but I never could learn chess and this seems easier to learn than chess!Anyway... this is good for an older child (teen) who is good at strategy and visualization and would be likely to play with peers of his or her same age.
There may be 8 year olds out there who can play this well but I doubt there are many.
I feel most would just be frustrated.
This game sat in a pile for quite awhile before I decided to tackle the difficult instructions and start playing.When I first read the instructions, I was very intimidated and confused.
They don't read well unless you are actually trying each step out and then moving on.
BUT, once you try, it is a very easy game to get into and play so it is well-worth the initial discomfort to gain the fun of playing.The object of the game is to systematically drop tiles onto your grid (kind of tetris style...) to make shapes, color blocks or groups.
There are up to four rounds of play, each with a different goal and point system.
Play can be as solitaire or up to 4 players.Once we started, my kids (ages 8 and 12) had fun playing.
It's easy to start, finishes quickly and can be picked up for a second or third game if you want to continue.
One set of four rounds takes about 15 minutes to complete.I did not give this a five star rating because there is not enough variety in the goals for each round.
There are four cards to match for each round which means that after playing through a few times, there is a lot of repetition.
It is still fun and my 8 year old has been nuts about playing but I'm finding it slightly limiting in grid size and possibilities.Still, a great game to add to your family game collection.
I would still recommend this.
I love this BITS game.
Let me start by saying I come from a long line of board game and puzzle doers.
I have tried to instill the same on my children and then are always looking for something new to play.
This game is great.
It combines the best of a puzzle and a strategic board game which requires planning and insight in order to win.
I highly recommend this to families who want to get their kids away from the tv and off social media and back to building interpersonal skills and having fun at the same time.
Makes a great Christmas gift.
Whenever I write a negative review I feel it is most helpful to compare items that I like better.
This helps to gauge if you like the same things.
That being said, we love games, and especially Ravensburger games.
I would highly recommend make and break challenge and labyrinth.
Both of those games are easier, more fun, span several age groups, and can be played more quickly, involving more people.
Skip this one.
As most of the other reviewers have said, the instructions do take patience.
The game is too simple for such ridiculous instructions.
The box is huge.
There are so dang many pieces!
Those pieces do not store neatly in the box, they just float loosely.
I am sure this was by design, but for us, we figure we will lose one too quickly to sustain the playability of the game.
I do like games that come nicely packaged.
We also like games that play quickly.
This one does if everyone is on the same level, but it seemed to get boring for my younger kids.
"BITS is the fourth Ravensburger game I've picked up in the past few months.
It is quite different that the others I have reviewed, and is, IMHO, an above-average game.
BITS is a 2-4 player game, and is more fun when payed with a full compliment of four.
Personally, I think playing it as couples is a great way to enjoy the game!BITS is a fairly easy game to learn, and the 4-round game can easily be completed in less than an hour.
Basically what you try to do in this game is to position your dual-color tiles (randomly selected, but everyone has to use the same tiles at the same time) in such a way that they create certain ""tetris-like"" shapes.
Points are awarded for differing variations of shape sizes and configurations.
The game manufacturer recommends this game for youths ages 8 and up, and this seems to be about right.
My 10-year old has played the game, and struggles a bit, but I don't think most 10-year olds would.
Playing it with kids younger than age 8 would be quite a challenge for them, I believe.Overall, a pretty good game.
I wouldn't strongly recommend it, but I wouldn't discourage purchasing it, either.
People who enjoy spatial reasoning and visualization will enjoy it more than others."
This was a hit with the kids in our house.
The game is new each time, and it teaches geometry in an implicit, practical way.
It encourages even young children to think spatially in interesting ways.
The colors are bright, and the game is affordable.
Great buy!
My family loves a good board game.
My 7 and 10 year old are getting old enough to play almost all of the really awesome board games out there.
We were excited to try BITS out.Players are making a game board similar to tetris.
Each turn you find out what shapes you should try to make with the different color tiles, and which shapes to avoid.Pros:Great for pattern makingGood for teaching spatial awarenessExcellent construction quality of the piecesRandomized beginning to turns means that everyone isn't copying each otherCons:Very similar to other games like BlokusNo real interaction between players.
This could be played individually with no differences.
How one player plays has no effect on the other players' experience of the game.Recommended if you have no other patterning games, but why would you choose this over Blokus?
"Not sure if others will have the same experience or not, but I needed to get half way through the first game with moderate reference to the instructions before I actually really comprehended the logistics of the game.
By the end of the game I thought, ""Ok, now I understand how to play, that was fun.
I'd play it again.""
It took forever to actually sit down and play because at first glance the whole game playing rules just weren't sinking in for me.
Even my husband benefited from my repeated referral to the instructions.
Our 11 yr old who is rather quick witted and bright just muddled along with us and didn't seem to gain much interest in the game at all.
It really required us all to have an ""open hands"" round.
It's a bit like Tetris, but with the variation of needing to make a certain shape using a certain number of tiles; with more or less points accumulated by making the shape in a particular color-or not, and in a particular representation-or not.
All the while ""drawing"" more tiles and placing them on our board in such a manner to both not mess up the grid pattern you're currently working on and also not building your tile grid up to the top of the tray (""game over for you!)
before successfully making the desired pattern.
Lots of small pieces and no compartments in the box to manage them.
The pieces must be divided amongst players in a specific categorical way at the start of each game.
I ended up using  at least 4 or 5 Ziplock bags to hold the pieces in their corresponding categories so they didn't need to be resorted at the start of each game.
I think even for people who may catch on quicker than we did I would still expect a bit of a learning curve in the beginning.
I hope my review helps you gain a quicker and more clear idea of the game.
All in all, I'd recommend it.
"The product description claims this is an ""all ages"" game.
Our entire family got frustrated with this game, ages ranging from kindergartner to adult.
No one understood the directions (I think there may be a translation problem; we had to extrapolate some of the ""how-to"").
The amount of frustration from the children brought on tears so we scrapped the game and the children ended up just playing with the pieces, making patterns.We've had good luck with other games that appeal to all ages (from Sorry to Harry Potter Lego).
This one simply isn't worth the brain strain and drama involved.
Ravensberger makes excellent games but this one is going out at the next yard sale, if we can be bothered to pull it off the netherworld top shelf where the ""never again"" games are relegated."
I thought that this would be a fun tetris like game for us all to play together.
We played it once, and my kids started to wander away from the table a few minutes into the game.
I called them back, telling them to give it a chance, but it just didn't seem to strike the right note with my family.
It is now on our game shelf, taking up space.The game is well designed, colorful, and for some folks, it might be a lot of fun.
For us, it was a bit of a dud.
"I got this as a Vine review product, but I don't think I would have ordered it on my own, so I am grateful for the opportunity to have experienced it.
We finally got around to playing it the other night and the family really enjoyed it.
As you might expect, it's kind of a low-tech version of the classic video game Tetris, with a few extra spins, but they made it work such that as a family game it's more interesting than the electronic game it derives from.
The instructions seemed a bit confusing at first, but once we figured it out, we realized that it is actually surprisingly simple.
For those who try the game, we enjoyed the ""round 1"" challenges the most, which provide multiple patterns from which you can score points.
Theoretically, you could tailor the game however you like - playing only Round 1 cards for example, or even creating your own pattern/color goals.The game flows very quickly.
We were finding we could get through all four rounds in a half-hour or less, so you don't have to have a lot of time to devote to the game.
You also have the flexibility of playing as many rounds as you want.Give it a try.
You'll have fun."
