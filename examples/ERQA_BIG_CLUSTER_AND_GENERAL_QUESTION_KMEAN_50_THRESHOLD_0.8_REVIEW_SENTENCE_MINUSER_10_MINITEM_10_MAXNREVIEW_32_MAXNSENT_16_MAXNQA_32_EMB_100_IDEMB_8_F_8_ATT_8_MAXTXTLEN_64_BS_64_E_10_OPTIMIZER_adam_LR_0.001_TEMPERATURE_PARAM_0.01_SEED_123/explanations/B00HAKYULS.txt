Reviews:
If you have young children who are interested in the Marvel characters like Iron Man, Wolverine, Hulk, or Thor, they may enjoy this build-able toy.
These toys are Marvel's Super Hero Smashers, and are semi-poseable plastic figurines that stand about 7&#34; tall.UNBOXING:Electronic Iron Man comes in a half-clear plastic and cardboard box 12 x 9 x 3&#34;.
Weirdly, Iron Man on the box picture is decked out in Wolverine gear that is not part of the set--makes me think of a Chinese Knock-off.
Inside the box, you get 1 iron man figure that's half assembled.
You re-attach his left arm, thigh, and foot.
This figure is like a large Marvel Legends Build-a-Character.
There are 11 other attachments: Tony Stark head; blue gauntlet arm, gun arm, and pistol; vest, blue missile, missile launcher, two blue leg guards, and two shoulder fired rocket packs.REVIEW:Neat idea!
I just wish it was more detailed and smaller to fit with the rest of my figure collection.
Iron Man's chest lights up when you press his torso.
Also, with all the additional weapons added on, Iron Man goes from looking like Iron Man to something more like a red War Machine.
Tony Stark's head looks like an angry Asian or Hispanic with a flat top.
His left hand is the only hand that can hold the pistol.
There's a hole in his right hand, and it holds the missile launcher (not really that well though).Each of the body parts has a hold for the attachable missile launcher and the knee guards.
All the holes are the same size, so you can theoretically put all the parts anywhere.
The joints in the head, shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees are only 2-way joints so range of motion is pretty bad.
Also, there is no joint articulation in the wrists.OVERALL:This toy was probably build for 4-6 year olds.
"My son likes this toy.
He often plays with a couple of them.
He likes switching parts around and pretending that one is a""good guy"" and another is ""a bad guy"".
Often, when my son plays with LEGO, he adds these toys to his plays.I think these toys are a bit pricey for plastic toys, but they are a lot better constructed and provide significantly more functionality than other plastic action figures."
My 6 yo son loves this action figure.
He's a builder who loves legos and any other kind of construction set, so this super heroe figure was right up his alley.
There is an extra set of arms to interchange, but I wish there was an extra set of legs as well.
There are other figures in this set and the parts interchange between them, so if you are up for collecting figures, these could be fun together.
The pieces were tricky to get out of the plastic for me, but eventually I was able to get them out of the plastic for my son.
As for quality, these are comparable to the Transformers Construct a Bots (which are much!!
more difficult to put together).
My son loves superheroes and action figures and this is a nice addition to his massive collection.
Unique about this one is that it has some interchangeable parts and electronic action.
The current price (around 16 dollars on Amazon) seems reasonable.
Some figures cost more and some are less usually ranging from ten to twenty bucks.
Holy best dad ever!
When my son got this he was super excited!
It comes with a million pieces that interchange and make iron man a completely different super hero.
And you can order other figures and mix and match them all together!
The only problem I have with it is that some of the pieces are hard to snap together.
So every 4 minutes I was being begged to change them!
Oh well!
Life of a dad!
I would definitely recommend this you to any super hero fan out there!
This is a cool little toy with many interchangeable parts that are easily maneuvered and assembled by the smallest of hands.
Once my son had it out of the pack, he was playing away with it and never once had to complain that he couldn't put something together.
It also has a decent price for what it is.
A little cheaper would probably be more appropriate, but it is pretty new.
It has a sturdy build and should make a nice play toy for any kid or superhero fan.
This is a cool &#34;little&#34; toy (it's actually not all that little, being the perfect size for a 5 year-old to play with).
It has a decent assortment of interchangeable parts that give little minds some fun playing options.
The missile-cannon is a fun addition, but obviously requires supervision to make sure ye olde eyes remain intact.
The articulation is fairly robust, but not something that leads to a situation where a child twists the legs behind the head (and can't get them back to the correct position).
The chest &#34;armor&#34; add-on is a bit annoying, however (this is where it loses a star).
It works very much like a tiny belt, requiring one end to be threaded through a clasp on the other, then a bit of finagling to get things to stay in place (for about 10s, before they pop back out).
Eventually, we just tossed the rubber armor (which meant we lost the missile pods, but it just wasn't worth the hassle).
We don't have any other toys from this line, so can't comment on using parts from other heroes, but if the switching back and forth on Iron Man is any indication, it works extremely well.
All told, this is an enjoyable toy, and with the full line, I'm sure Hydra is quaking in the boots as they contemplate the super hero possibilities.PS The gun comment in the title is a bit of a throwaway line, but seriously, has Iron Man ever used a gun (when he was Iron Man)?
Just seems like an odd inclusion.
Now an ridiculously oversized beam cannon?
Yeah.
:)
We got this for our 4 year old because he's totally into all things Marvel (and specifically Spiderman and Iron Man).
He loves it.
*  From a parent's perspective, it's a pretty nice toy.
The action figure has good articulation and the parts stay together pretty well.
The box says 4+ and that's probably right because he needed a bit of help sticking the arms and legs and various other parts together.
One neat positive feature is there are a ton of attachment points for the various extra armor pieces.
Our son particularly liked the missile shooter and the fact that the chest plate lit up brightly.
I liked the fact that the missile worked regardless of the orientation and the chest light has replaceable batteries.Overall I highly recommend this toy and I hope this review helps you make a decision.
* = Don't make the same mistake I did; I gave it to him 10 minutes before bedtime, which completely delayed the process.
I should have known better!
"My 4-year-old grandson absolutely loves all the Marvel superheroes so I got him this set expecting him to have hours of fun with it.
Well, though the iron man figure comes with a Tony Stark head, and some arms and a missile launcher, there really isn't any ""mash-up"" to do unless you buy at least one other superhero mashers figure so that your child could interchange the parts.
Since that is the intended point of this toy, the play value will only be enhanced if there are many other arms, legs, weapons, heads, etc.
to push on and off the figure.This leads me to the other problem with this toy -- the parts.
There are a lot of them to keep track of, especially if you buy another figure set or two.
Within a day or so, a couple of the pieces couldn't be located and still have not been found because they are quite small.
This is not a toy for any child who is not old enough to know not to put pieces in his/her mouth.
The toy is electronic only in that there is a light on the figure's chest and it comes with its own special battery so unsure how long that will last.In short -- if your child can keep track of all the parts, be sure to get at least one other figure so it can be used as designed."
"Flexible Heroes:Need to crush a monster at a moment's notice?
No problem: borrow the super strength of the Hulk and get smashing.
Marvel Super hero Masters Electronic iron man is the ninth in a group of 6 inch fabulous figures of which Spider-Man, Captain America, Electronic Iron-Man, Hulk, Iron-man, Thor, and Venom are amazing.
Doctor Doom and Electronic Wolverine figure are two very impressive ones, and most popular for both my grandsons, builders of figures that amaze me, reducing my age to one digit.Iron Man figures:Electronic Iron Man figure's light-up repulsor and launching missile accessory add other dimensions of awe to your favorite Super Hero mash-up.
This Iron Man figure got 11 ""points of articulation,"" my grandsons (7 & 9) build and customize their heros, each one his own way, and get ready for an adventureous mashed-up experience!
They combine universally compatible parts from different figures to create a custom Super Hero mash-up.

Then Noah and Oliver would blast into battle with the Missile launcher or light-up repulsor.
They swap gear with the Wolverine figure and pretend to slice and dice through the locks with his diamond-hard claws.
With the powers and gear of all your favorite Super Heroes at their fingertips, they pick and choose their parts to make the perfect mash-up, leaving me hero masher-struck."
the idea of a super hero toy that gets more interesting the more pieces you collect is great one.
marvels build a figures from back in the day are a great example.
this toy however is just not up to that high standard.
the plastic as a bit to flimsy, the rocket fires way to easily, and the arms and legs don't connect very well.
i didn't give this a lower score because i think this can still be a fun toy, you just shouldn't get your hopes up.
The kid likes this action figure-- lots of ways to configure the toy, lots of different stories to make up about him.
For adults, lots of little pieces to be left lying on the floor in order to be stepped on.
OW!Oh well, the toy does keep them entertained.
I gave the Marvel Super Hero Mashers Electronic Iron Man Figure to my five-year-old son as a gift maybe a month ago.
He loved it at first because you can take parts off and put them on, and switch weapons.
So he enjoyed it for a while.
And we enjoyed the fact that it doesn't make any noise.
But after about a week, Iron Man ended up in the toy bin with the other toys that don't get used.
So my recommendation is to consider how much your child would use this before buying.In my view, the various small parts are not a big deal (as long as you don't have kids under 3 in the house, of course) because if you put the toy away assembled, the parts will stay together and then you just have to keep track of a couple extra pieces.All in all, I rate this toy four stars because to really get the most out of it you have to buy more than one, and because my son quickly lost interest in the single toy.
I got this for my 3-year-old for his birthday.
He is a little younger than the recommended age, but he still really likes the toy.
All his friends at his birthday party thought it was cool, too.
An older brother of his friend was most excited about it (6 years old).
My son hasn't quite figured out all the &#34;mash-up&#34; capability, but he likes all the individual parts and playing with all of them.
I figure this is going to last him a while as he grows into it.
I almost feel like words cannot express how much my 6-year old loves his mashers.
Since he saw the first commercials on TV, he has saved his allowance to collect his first guys.Iron Man, however, was in a league of its own.
We need a bag to carry all the pieces around, but my son seems to love all that the set offers.
He has forgotten both his Spiderman and Hulk are compatible with this guy.
It's all Iron Man, all the time.Additionally (as the Mom here), the packaging was incredible.
No ties, not a lot of garbage and absolute no frustration.
These pieces were in one plastic piece, and after I cut the tape on the box, I easily popped each piece out of the holder.Excellent product - we're huge Mashers fans forevermore!
These are fun!
It adds another dimension to the regular action figure.
It allows the kids more options, and I think it increases their imagination.
These are mix and match, so you can swap super powers.
It lets your child make the ultimate super hero.
I would definitely recommend these for anyone that loves super heroes, or is a collector.
My son is currently obsessed with the Avengers.
This is our first Mash-Up but I can see how they would be quite popular.
The pieces are easy to remove and attach (although I would recommend keeping a ziploc or storage box handy to keep up with the small pieces that are not currently in use).
My son thought the light up repulser was pretty neat as well.
We'll have tp gradually add on some more accessories,  but for now, it's a hit!
I rated Marvel Sup hero mashers electronic iron man figure 5 stars because my son loves to play with it.
Iron Man is one of his favorite super heroes and this one offers so much fun.I especially like that it is interchangeable with the other mashers figures so that you can really customize these heroes as far as your imagine can create them.
Overall, this is a fun toy for a super hero fan!
Most boys love super hero figures, and this one doesn't disappoint.
It's fun to build and has many cool appendages that keep kids busy.
The figure's accessories can be mixed, taken off, or put on as wanted.
In fact, this toy is fabulous for imaginary play.The figure comes with many small pieces that can be put on the figure's body.
I don't, therefore, recommend this toy for children who may still put objects in their mouth or children with small siblings.
I do, though, recommend this toy for any child with an active imagination who loves super heroes.
I have two sons, ages 5 and 8.
The 5 year old is an Iron Man fan, while the 8 year old is not.
So, I selected this toy, primarily for my younger son.
This toy, the &#8220;Marvel Super Hero Mashers Electronic Iron Man Figure&#8221; is part of a set of Marvel superhero &#8220;mashers&#8221;, but as this is the only one I own, I&#8217;ll review it as a stand-alone toy.It comes with two sets of arms and heads (one head is Iron Man&#8217;s helmet and the other is Tony Starks), and numerous other attachments, the most impressive of which is a &#8220;rocket launcher&#8221;, which actually launches a plastic &#8220;rocket&#8221;.
The suit also lights up, courtesy of 2 included batteries.My younger son was easily able to swap out the various body parts and attachments.
(He&#8217;s been doing the same with the various Power Ranger Zords and Megazords, which are much more complicated than this toy.)
He is having a good time mixing this into his existing toy figurine universe.
My older son, although not an Iron Man fan, also likes to play with it, although I can&#8217;t tell if it&#8217;s because he likes the concept or he just wants to annoy his little brother.
:-)Overall, this is a good toy, although I suspect you&#8217;ll want to get more figures so as to be able to swap parts between the superheroes, as well as to fill out your Marvel collection.
Four stars.
