Top sentence(s):
And as a parent and homeschooling mother, I'm always looking for ways to cater toward my children's development.
I'm very pleased with the quality of the puzzle and tin.
The adorable, red- handled tin with can double as a storage box for other toys as well (like my son's toy cars when he eventually tires of completing puzzles).
The puzzle illustration itself is very colorful and quite eye catching.
Not only did my nephew absolutely love this puzzle, he loved the handy tin as well!

Reviews:
"My four-year-old really enjoyed Ravensburger's ""Thomas and Friends: Carnival At Night"" 35-piece puzzle.
I judged this to be a larger product based on the photo, and I was let down at first when such a small box arrived on my doorstep.
But inside was a charming and sturdy tin in the shape of Thomas, and the moment my daughter saw it, I knew that she was pleased.
I should add that Thomas the Tank Engine, while known somewhat in my household, is not a favorite character.
Beyond a smartphone app, my daughter has had very little exposure to him, which is a testament to how nice this puzzle must be for little ones.We worked on this together and had a great time.
The pieces had smooth edges which are easy for kids and adults to handle and position.
This puzzle is just challenging enough for a four-year-old to keep them occupied and engaged for quite a while, and I feel that it's one that will be re-assembled in the future.
For adults, the attractive suitcase-type tin is a wonderful addition which ensure that the pieces never go missing.
All in all, this is a great, simple product, well made, and easily recommended."
The puzzle is a fairly straightforward 35 piece puzzle.
The picture is Thomas the tank engine and 3 of his friends.
The colors are bright, and the pieces are 1-2 inches in length.
Big enough to give enough detail on every piece so that a child can figure out what it is and (hopefully) figure out where it goes.
My only real gripe with the puzzle is that every piece can fit into each other piece - there's no uniqueness.
I feel like the tin is a nice idea that doesn't really come through.
Yeah, it's cute, and it won't get beat up like boxes will over time, but it also doesn't really stack well with the other puzzles and games on the shelf.
This makes a really great gift.
It's not just a puzzle, or just Thomas carry case, it's both.
I actually got this for a friends 3 year old, but when my 6 year saw it he insisted on having it.
The puzzle is as most kids puzzles are, fairly easy for older kids, but still fun, even the 10 year old neighbor enjoyed pitching in.
I really like this set, espeically since the tin in nice enough to store other things once the puzzle becomes less fun.
My 2.5 year old grandson is just starting to do puzzles and these large floor puzzles are great.
On top of that, he love Thomas and Friends so this Thomas and Friends Carnival at Night 35-piece Puzzle is just right for him.
It also comes in a great little round tin that he carries around like a suitcase.
He has found several used for it.
Luckily, I have a puzzle bin where he can put the pieces so he can use the tin as another toy.
He did need help with it and being it is only his second puzzle, I think it is fine.
As a former educator, I like that it teaches him about shapes and spatial relationships.
For him, it is just fun!
My son lit up when he saw the tin for this Thomas the train puzzle.
The puzzle is a fun picture with Thomas and many of his train friends.
The puzzle pieces are a nice size, thick and durable.
It's an ideal puzzle for kids who love Thomas and are in that 3-5 year old range.
I'm very pleased with the quality of the puzzle and tin.
okay, so I find personally the clash of secondary colors a biut strong in this productthe orange on purple and the greenbut still we find an opportunity to discuss colors hereand the characters are of course belovedI have used this with large groups of four and five year olds and they love it and we share and we think and we do itas well as independentlyyupI can do it all by myselfnow
"Ravensburger's ""Thomas & Friends - Carnival At Night"" is a wonderful 35-piece puzzle which children may enjoy assembling.
It is more compact than the company's 24-piece floor puzzles for younger toddlers; finished size is approximately 12"" X 18"".
Thomas the Train and his fellow engines are very familiar characters for most children - and for their parents.
Those young Thomas fans should have fun putting this puzzle together, as they learn to relate spatial and linear concepts when placing pieces correctly to form the completed picture.
Thomas the Train fans, in particular, will find this a wonderful puzzle.Ravensburger's ""Thomas & Friends -  Carnival At Night"" puzzle is sturdy and the picture is firmly attached so that little ones will have quite a bit of difficulty if they are prone to ""peeling"" items apart.
The die-cuts are smooth which allows for easy assembly.
Pieces fit together well.
They are not so tight that a child will become frustrated, nor so loose that the puzzle will fall apart if jostled slightly.
Unlike Ravensburger floor puzzles whose pieces have a slightly textured surface, the surface of the  ""Thomas & Friends -  Carnival At Night"" pieces is smooth.The Thomas the Train carrying tin Ravensberger has used is sturdy; the use of a ""suitcase"" shape is unique and clever.
Including a handle for carrying, as if the puzzle container actually were a carry-on tote, adds to the overall train and travel theme of this product.Although recommended for ages 4 - 6 years, I think younger children with whom an adult is ""playing"" can enjoy Ravensburger's ""Thomas & Friends - Carnival At Night"" puzzle.
If attempting to assemble this puzzle alone, younger children may become frustrated.
Ravensberger's ""Thomas & Friends - Carnival At Night"" puzzle is definitely a 5 star toy - not only for its fun factor, but also for its durability and its educational value."
All aboard is a phrase daily heard and said in my household.
You guessed it, my son is a huge Thomas the Tank Engine Fan!
And as a parent and homeschooling mother, I'm always looking for ways to cater toward my children's development.
I've found that puzzles are excellent for children to improve fine motor skills and logical thinking.
Plus puzzles are great to have around for some quite downtime!This puzzle is by one of our favorite companies, Ravensburger.
We not only like the puzzles offered but the games are equally excellent too.
We've always found this company to be of the very best quality and all the games and products we have from them have provided for a good time always.The Thomas & Friends Carnival at Night 35-Piece Puzzle has been a hit with both my nearly two year old and my four and half year old.
My first praise is going to the handy storage tin!
I like that all the pieces easily fit inside the tin and it can be taken along easy without fear of losing any pieces.
You can also use the tin for other things.
I know my son has enjoyed storing some of his treasures in there during play while the puzzle was set up on a table.The puzzle itself features Thomas, Percy, James, and Gordon.
The pieces are very child friendly and have held up wonderfully over time.
I've lost count of how many times this puzzle has been taken apart and put together again by my kids.
The puzzle illustration itself is very colorful and quite eye catching.
I can see us eventually using puzzle glue and hanging it up in the wall once my son outgrows it and it's ready for something more challenging!Overall, we are extremely happy with the Thomas & Friends Carnival at Night 35-Piece Puzzle.
It's durable, challenging, colorful, and comes in a fun tin that can double as more than a puzzle storage box.
My son loved the tin that the puzzle came in.
It is not very big and stands upright by itself.
I liked the size because it makes it easy to store.
The back of the tin has the picture of the puzzle.
It is a little small but you are still able to see the detail.
The puzzle is a good picture for small children as they are able to see the difference in the areas to build the picture.
The picture size is a good size and the pieces are perfect for children.
I would recommend this as a good puzzle to add to your collection.
My son who is 4 managed to place several of the pieces by himself.
My 3-year-old son (and his 3-year-old cousin)absolutely revels in both the subject and the toy itself.
He love Thomas and putting together a jigsaw puzzle is an added bonus.The tin in which it comes is interesting and he is fascinated by it, playing with the catch and taking some joy in taking out and putting the pieces back in afterwards.The pieces are somewhat durable and it's just difficult enough to put together without causing frustration.
He will get bored with it, letting a week go then he will play with it for days straight, this toy has playing durability which I love.In addition, nothing beats seeing the kids successfully complete the puzzle and identify Thomas, Percy, James and the gang.
"My 5 yr old little boy loves Thomas and has a new found fondness of puzzles.
This puzzle (along with another Thomas one of the same size) was just an instant hit with him.
We (mostly him) put it together many times and finally put the ""puzzle glue"" on it and hung it up on the wall.
He is so proud every time he looks at it and tells me he put it together by himself!
Now I just have to buy more puzzles for him.
:-)"
The Thomas the Train puzzle comes in a fun container which is easy to tote around.
It has larger pieces for little toddlers to be able to grab.
My kids enjoy this puzzle, and I especially enjoy the tin container as it makes it less likely that we will lose a puzzle piece!
Worth purchasing, especially if your child loves Thomas the Train.
I've noticed that when these fun puzzles come in interesting containers, it is SO much easier to entice kids to put their puzzles away afterwards!
The puzzle is nice, pieces are a good size, and the puzzle scene is colorful and interesting for the preschoolers.
Being able to tote this about the house in the tin is also a big plus for some little guys!
This colorful and attractive 35-piece puzzle features Thomas the Train with a carnival and fireworks in the background.
It is perfect for my 3 year old boy who loves puzzles.
The pieces are just the right size for small hands.
As usual this Ravensburger puzzle is sturdy and of excellent quality.
As a bonus the puzzle comes in a decorative lunchbox-type tin for easy storage.
Highly recommended.
Looking for an activity (other than coloring) that I could enjoy with my granddaughter, I decided to get this puzzle since she loves Thomas and I've always enjoyed jigsaw puzzles.
I am really pleased with it--putting the puzzle together provides alone time for her and me, AND she loves the carrying case.
It seems that the puzzle pieces will have to be stored in a baggie because the case was too attractive for her to leave on the shelf--it does make a nice overnight bag for baby doll clothes.
You can get jigsaw puzzles at dollar stores and other discount outlets, but this puzzle far outshines them in terms of attractiveness, quality, and durability.
You definitely get what you pay for.
My 3yr old daughter loves Thomas and this puzzle she can actually put it together (with some help of course)the pieces are big for little hands and a little thick they should hold up well.
Love the little Tin keeps things nice and neat, the colors are vibrant and beautiful great educational toy.
Very cute tin...smaller for little hands.
My therapy kids loved the case and easily put the puzzle together.
If your child loves Thomas, this is a nice gift and will work well traveling.
The picture itself is bright and cheerful and the pieces sturdy and interlock well.
Ravensburger puzzles are a brand I have come to trust and like.
Why?
Because the puzzles are beautiful & colorful and unlike many of the cheaper brands, the pieces are fairly sturdy.
This one is no exception.
Thomas, Percy, and Gordon are displayed in brilliant color.
The carry tin is a nice touch and can even be used as a lunch box.My three year old have played with the tin and assembled the puzzle non-stop since it arrived last week.
Overall, a huge hit.
Ravensburger's has again put out a great puzzle for the 2 and up age group.
It's a sturdy puzzle with well cut pieces, well laminated and great graphics.
This one has an added attraction of being in an carrying tin.
It's more than large enough for the puzzle pieces and has a simple latch at the top with a redhandle to carry it around with.
I'd recommend putting the puzzle in a 1quart ziploc as my 3yr old carries this around everywhere and checks in on the puzzle every so often and dumps it on the floor with some other treasure that he's put in there as well.All said another great puzzle (and carrying case) by Ravensburger's!
"This puzzle is absolutely adorable and the kids just love it.
It's really two toys in one, as the kids right away said they would carry other ""stuff"" around in the wonderful metal tin, which has a handle and looks like a little suitcase.
The 35 puzzle pieces are on the small side, so this is *not* for very young children.
The manufacturer says ages 4-6, but I suspect a 4-year-old might have some trouble with the puzzle pieces and/or might get bored or frustrated trying to put 35 pieces together.
So far, the pieces seem very sturdy, but we haven't had it for very long yet.
The tin looks bigger in the photo than it is; it is about 9"" wide at its widest."
Not only did my nephew absolutely love this puzzle, he loved the handy tin as well!
On Christmas Day alone he put it together three different times and proudly showed it off to anyone who would take a look!
He's five years old and this puzzle is perfect for him!
"Kids love puzzles and our grandson loves Thomas.
Almost all other puzzles come in cardboard boxes that are subject to falls and getting stepped on and generally disintegrating.
This colorful Thomas the Train Engine puzzle comes in a sturdy tin ""lunch box"" - easy to carry and pretty difficult to accidentally destroy."
WHAT A GREAT PUZZLE.
I THINK ITS A WONDERFUL GIFT, SOMETHING THAT IS EDUCATIONAL AND FUN TO WORK THROUGH.
THE METAL BOX IS GREAT AND SEEMS LIKE IT WILL LAST.
JESUS' BLESSINGS AND PEACE
his mother tells me he loves this puzzle and he REALLY loves the case carries it around with him!
very fun to put together for the 1 1/2 year old and his 7 year old cousin.
Thomas the train is a great hit in the household and its durable well made and very fun to a small toddler who adores puzzles and Thomas the train!
highly recommend!
Very nice puzzle.
This is a quality puzzle with the added bonus of a tin box.
I own more than one Ravensburger puzzle for adults.
I particularly like the ones that you can use your smart phone with after you complete putting it together.
What they all (including this one) have in common is a a well made puzzle piece designed to last and be put together over and over.
My nieces and nephew love Thomas and this was a huge hit!
The finished puzzle is vibrant, colorful, and very eye-catching.
It's educational in that it can help with spatial reasoning and problem solving.
We have many puzzles and games from the Ravensburger company and they are always made of high quality cardboard and are sturdy for small kids.
All the pieces interlock perfectly, unlike puzzles I bought from other companies that have small gaps between the pieces and bend easily.
I love the metal tin that it comes in because it's much sturdier than a cardboard box and make traveling with the puzzle easy without the worry of the pieces spilling out.
The metal tin also doubles nicely as a lunchbox!
My grandson loves puzzles and if it's Thomas he likes it even more.
The pieces are sturdy and the tin container makes a great way to keep them stored properly.
My grandson adds a few of his trains to the case and he is ready to go.
This is a beautiful Thomas puzzle with high quality colorful graphics like all Ravensburger puzzles.
The 35 piece design will pose more of a challenge for preschoolers than simple 25 piece Thomas puzzles.
The adorable, red- handled tin with can double as a storage box for other toys as well (like my son's toy cars when he eventually tires of completing puzzles).
The Carnival at Night puzzle is another quality, visually attractive Ravensburger offering with a great carrying case at a very reasonable price.
If your children like Thomas, they will love to see Thomas and Friends under the fireworks!
The Thomas & Friends Carnival Night puzzle comes in a adorable round collector's style tin which has a convenient handle so you can take this puzzle where you need to go.
The Thomas puzzle is 35 pieces and recommended for ages 4-6 mostly i think due to the size of the pieces which is a little above normal/standard.
Overall it's a lot of fun to put together, the children love the cute little tin with Thomas on the front and it makes a great gift.
I got this for a 3 year old who breezes through 24 piece puzzles.
This was definitely a step up, but she enjoys the challenge.
The pieces are the right size for her hands.
She likes Thomas and the gang too.
When we are finished putting it together, she wants to take it apart and do it again.
She really likes the unique carrying case as well.
This is a very nice 35 piece puzzle that features Thomas the Tank Engine and friends in a carnival setting.
The set comes in a tin box and the pieces are pretty sturdy, if a tad too small for very young children.
This puzzle is just about right for a child aged 3-5 and serves as a great way to help kids develop their hand-eye coordination, problem solving skills and best of all, gives them a sense of pride in a job followed through to completion.
Easily recommended.
And besides, who doesn't love Thomas?
"Just like my seven year old once did, my nearly four year old has a passionate, on-going love affair with all things Thomas and Friends.
Train sets, many if not most of the Sodor engines, DVDs, books, puzzles, you name it, we have it.
And my wife is so enchanted by how much they both enjoy Thomas, she's already made plans to save much of our Thomas paraphernalia for any future grandchildren.
(Oh well, more stuff to store in the basement for the next 20 years.)
My little guy has mastered all of his 24-piece puzzles, so I was happy to see this 35-piece puzzle.
So, here are my thoughts on the ""Thomas & Friends Carnival at Night 35-Piece Puzzle in a Round Tin"".Pros:- While not as big as the pieces in most 24-piece puzzles, the size of the pieces are 4-year old friendly, and can be thought of as transitional from toddler puzzles to kid puzzles..- The cardboard puzzle pieces are sturdy and should stand up well to inadvertent abuse from impatient little fingers- The puzzle comes in a round tin, reminiscent of a lunch box, which I personally found pretty neat, as it's easier to carry and more secure than a normal cardboard box.
My little boy also likes to use it to hold other things, such as his Thomas take-along-trains.- My son did find this a bit more challenging than 24 piece puzzles, but still easily doable.
He also likes the picture of the finished puzzle, which is bright and colorful.Cons:- None, really, although I wouldn't mind if the completed puzzle were a bit larger.Overall ... if you've got a boy or girl, say from ages 4 to 6, who can name more than 20 Sodor engines, you really should get them this fun puzzle.
After all, you can never have too much Thomas, and this puzzle is a good value for the money.
:-) Five stars."
