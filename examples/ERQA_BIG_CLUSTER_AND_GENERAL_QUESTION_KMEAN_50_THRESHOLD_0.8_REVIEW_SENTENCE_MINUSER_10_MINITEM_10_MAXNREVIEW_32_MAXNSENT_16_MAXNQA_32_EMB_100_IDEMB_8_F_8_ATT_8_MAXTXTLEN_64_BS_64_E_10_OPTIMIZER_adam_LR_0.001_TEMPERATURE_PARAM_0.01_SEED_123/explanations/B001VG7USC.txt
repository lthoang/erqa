Top sentence(s):
The finite nature of the game (4 rounds vs a theoretically infinite playing time in Tetris) means that you have to score your points where you can get them, and pay severely for any early mistakes.
This game was a hit with my kids (ages 7-8) and with my teenage nephews and nieces.
We play with our 9yo granddaughter, and we enjoy the game as much as she does.
This is a fun game for a family who likes competition and wou;d be fun for lovers of classic games as well.
As others have described, the game involves placing Tetris-shaped plastic pieces on a personal game board; points are earned by completing horizontal lines of tiles.

Reviews:
It's like Tetris for the family without the electronics.
That means the last row doesn't drop off like Tetris, so it's manual, but sometimes we need a little break from all the electronics.The game takes less than an hour.
It's good for oldish elementary school-aged kids and up.
A younger kid can 'play' solo without the pressure of a group/time and spend the time to puzzle the pieces in.Great way to exercise the brain and practice spatial reasoning.
"First and foremost, this game is by Ravensburger so the potential buyer should know that even if the game is simple, it will at least be made well and have well thought out rules.
This game is no exception as the game pieces are solid little pieces of plastic and the stands are well assembled.Like many have said, the premise is similar to the game of Tetris.
Completing rows of blocks earns you points.
The better you do, the more points you get, the better you score against your opponents.
Pretty simple.As one other reviewer also noted, this game would serve well as an ""introduction"" game to those who didn't realize that there are other games out there besides Monopoly and Sorry.
Once you get them into games like this you may be able to introduce other table top games like Ticket To Ride or Talisman."
OK, so it's obviously Knizia reworking Tetris, but it is worth pointing out that people like my 9-year-old daughter haven't spent almost 30 years playing Tetris, and so this is a relatively new concept.
Also, there are some pretty basic differences between Tetris and FITS which mean that if you don't approach the game for what it is, you'll get clobbered with negative points.
The finite nature of the game (4 rounds vs a theoretically infinite playing time in Tetris) means that you have to score your points where you can get them, and pay severely for any early mistakes.
It may be derivative, but that doesn't mean that the game can't make you feel like a complete moron after having played.
The first game I played with my daughter resulted in her winning with a score of ZERO.
My -11 point score left me wondering if I was no longer competent to be raising a child without the authorities stepping in.
It has gotten better since then, but this is a hugely challenging game.
A variety of expansions will help in keeping the game fresh.The only criticisms of this would be that 1) it is essentially multi-player solitaire (but really, one could say that about very nearly every puzzle game), and 2) some parts of this game are REALLY flimsy.
The polyominoes are about the only part of the game which look like they wouldn't become damaged if you look at them the wrong way.
This game isn't terribly expensive, but it's expensive enough.
I want something that is built to last for a reasonable amount of time, and I really have my doubts about this.Nonetheless, it is fun, and it is challenging.
As they often say, easy to teach, difficult to master.
It won't hurt your kids to give this shot.
And since studies suggest that playing games and puzzles helps to ward off Alzheimer's, and can't hurt those growed up people either.
"As a fan of Tetris back in the day, I was very interested in a board game that looked similar.
And while it's a fun game, it's not as enjoyable as Tetris itself and gets a little dull when in terms of repeat play.The premise is pretty simple, in that you're using the ""bricks"" to fill your game card.
There are four rounds with different game cards for each, while the pieces remain the same each time.
This does add a little fun to the game in that you have to use different approaches depending on the round.
You can be aggressive and go for a lot of points, or play conservative, and both approaches are influenced by the order of the cards.
One of the things I didn't like - and this probably comes from being spoiled by Tetris - is that you can't turn the pieces once you start moving them down your game board.
That makes it more challenging, but also takes away some creativity.
I will say that the rules and the different boards certainly make it challenging, even after having played several times.I played this game with both of my daughters, who are eight and five (the game says 8+).
The older one was able to grasp the game very easily even if she didn't understand the strategy too well, and the younger one pretty much had the grasp of it as well.
The boards and the stands are quite durable, and the bricks are very well-made.
Although it's not my favorite, it's another excellent game from this manufacturer."
We have three board gamers in the house beside myself, they are 11, 12, and 13.
This is all the awesomeness of Tetris on a game board.
You really can play 1 to 4 players.
I love that it encourages strategy and quick spatial thinking for the kids.
We can play a game in about a half an hour.Each player has a slanted board that they will use to place their pieces.
You draw cards to determine which dominoe like tetrisy piece you will place on your board.
The randomness is in the draw of the card.
It is like tetris in that you can arrange the piece before you slide it onto your board, however, unlike Tetris, once the piece is in place you cannot move the piece horizontally.
The game is scored based on your configuration and the amount of open spaces available.You can skip a piece if it is areal pain, but that might bite you in the end, for the scoring.
A round ends after the last card is flipped, there are four rounds per game.
There are expansion packs.
These come in the form of the cards you place on your game board.
I have seen some of the reviews of the expansions state that the expansion packs are not the same thickness quality as the original game.
I have yet to try these for myself.And even though we can play a quick game in 30 minutes, we usually end up playing one more game.
There is no time limit like in Tetris, and you can become really involved and sometimes even frustrated with your game board.It's fun, give her a try.
This is a fun little game.
It does certainly have a resemblance to Tetris, in that it requires players to fit different-shaped pieces together on a rectangular board, starting at the bottom and moving toward the top.
The similarities pretty much end there, though.
Tetris only has a few distinct pieces that repeat throughout the game.
FITS has many pieces, and no two are alike.
Most of the challenge of Tetris is related to speed -- the pieces keep coming at you faster and faster.
In FITS you have some time to consider each piece before placing it.Where I think this game really shines is the four different rounds.
Each has its own strategy.
In the first round, the players just attempt to fill as much of their board as possible.
In the second and third rounds, bonus points and penalty points are given for leaving certain spaces uncovered.
In the final round, five separate symbols appear twice each on the board.
Players are rewarded for leaving both uncovered, and penalized for covering just one.Overall, I like this game for its relatively simple and unique mechanics, short playing time, and stimulating strategy.
It's easy to learn, but I feel that mastering it could take some time.
I found this game to be quite boring.
I like games likeDominionandDixitand this game is not in the same league at all.
I have to admit I am not a huge Tetris fan either so maybe this game will appeal more to fans of Tetris.
This is a fun game for a family who likes competition and wou;d be fun for lovers of classic games as well.
This is sort of like manual (non-electronic/digital) Tetris, but with a twist.
It is recommended for age 8 and up.
I played several times with my 8-year-old son.
He's great at Math and reasoning, but he still made decisions that cost him some points, even when I tried to explain why.
However, I think you could level the playing field more by only playing with the Level 1 game board.
There are actually 4 different boards, and you are supposed to play one round on each.
The levels of difficulty definitely keep it interesting, and I think specifically with adult players, this will keep the interest level high.And as I mentioned in another review of a Ravensburger game, the pieces are so durable (the little game pieces are not cardboard but a sturdy plastic-y material).
Additionally, the pieces store inside the game boards, which is great.
My husband and i LOVE to play board games together, so i grabbed this since we're both also huge fans of a certain video game that rhymes with... metris.
At first we were a little overwhelmed, it seemed like it might be complicated and a lot to learn, but we quickly saw that it's VERY easy to learn how to play FITS.
But even though it's easy to learn, it's still LOTS of fun, challenging,  different every time you play, and easy to fly through a whole game in less than a half hour.... meaning plenty of time for rematches!
Highly recommended - in fact, so far we own 5 Ravensburger games and we highly recommend ALL of them!
This is a great alternative to traditional board games.
I had doubts my six-year-old son would be able to pick up the rules, but with a bit of help, he really enjoyed it.
It doesn't quite follow the same rules as Tetris, but it's very similar and has several different modes of varying difficulty.
After everyone places their starter block, cards are drawn and everyone places blocks until all have been placed or passed on.
Simple but also challenging with lots of replayability.
The overall quality of the game is better than expected.
The platforms are sort of flimsy, but the pieces are good and solid.Our whole family loved it, definitely a winner from Ravensburger.
I'd like to give 3.5 stars...but rounded up because it is a good concept and we enjoyed it.
I was disappointed that the ramps (the part that all of the playing is done on) are a thin, flimsy plastic that I have no doubt will break with one wrong move.
Since it is my children who will play this mostly, they won't last long.
I'll likely build some wooden ones to replace them.
The rest of the game is pretty durable.This is another Ravensburger game that is good for visual-spatial skills.
It is good for building strategic skills, patterning, and planning ahead.
It would be a good math game.
It is best for older children (maybe 8 and up...which is exactly the ages the company suggests...they were right on target).
There isn't a good way to adapt this game to younger children.
This game is suggested for ages 8 and up, and I would concur with that.
My test kidlets were younger than that, so for them the rule that you couldn't slide pieces around once they were in place was one that they had a hard time sticking with.
The four year old was just happy to try to cover all the dots on the playing board by fitting as many of the pieces together that he could; he's at that age where he's really interested in putting puzzles together so although the game was beyond him, he still found a way to have fun with it.As an adult though, I thought this was a fun game.
As others have described, the game involves placing Tetris-shaped plastic pieces on a personal game board; points are earned by completing horizontal lines of tiles.
The trick is, though, that once you place your piece you can't slide it around, so if you've created a gap that you can't drop a piece into, then you're not going to earn a point for that line.
It's an easy game, yet it's a game of strategy.
Pieces are chosen by the turn of a card with the shaped image on it; the direction the image on the card means that each piece can be placed in one of four directions, multiplying the flexibility of the game.The game itself is well-made, as all Ravensburger games seem to be.
The plastic pieces are not lightweight nor easily breakable; they feel sturdy to play with.
The personal game boards are well designed, non-skid and allow for the storage of their colored pieces underneath the game card, minimizing the chance of losing them.
This is a great family game for game night or rainy days because it's easy to learn, easy to play, requires problem-solving skills, yet does not drag on and on if you've got short-attention-span players.
Kids age-8 and above can play this one on their own.I recommend it.
"Being a Blokus fan I was a little hesitant about this game.
But, boy am I glad I gave it a shot.
The main difference is that you are building up from your own board instead of competing for space with others.
Plus, there is a point system that turns up the tension level with each round.
I found myself watching the scorecard and double checking my strategies.The only downside to this game was some confusion about some of the scoring rules.
We definitely had a ""this is what I hope they meant"" period where all four of us had to agree which points ""count"".
If the manufacturer contacts me I will help clarify this further.This game is safe for the whole family and is moving to the top of the list for our next game night.
It's a great ""FITS""!"
We have family game night atleast once a day over the weekend.
We generally play cards, with the most popular being Uno, among other games.
Overall this game was a nice start into the real games of our game night.If you play too many times in one sitting, it will get boring; especially for the younger kids.One round should take around 5-7 minutes.
Each game has 4 rounds.
The winner is the one with the most points at the end.Each round has different playing boards; though they are all real simple to understand the concept.Pro's:-Easy to understand how it works.
It took my daughter (9yrs old); who had never heard of Tetris by the way, less than 5 mins to understand all the game boards-Easy to setup and clean up; All the 4 slabs hold inside its own boards and tetris pieces.-Dont need much strategy reallyCon's:-The tetris pieces are nice and durable but i am worried about the playing cards.
They are pretty flimsy paper, so i'm not sure how long they'll last.
The slabs are just plastic as well, could easily rip or bend.Summary: If you want a nice complement to your game night, i.e to start it off and get everyone in the mode, and you like tetris; this is pretty good choice for you.
If your looking for the centrepiece for your game night; pass on this and look for something else; my personal recommendation is Uno.
"I very much like board games of all sorts, and will hold no discretion to even the simplest of games (e.g., Go Fish).
If it entertains the other party members, I'm all for it.Personally, I like the meatier games stemming from various parts of Europe, namely Germany.
Which is why I was attracted to FITS.
As well as being a 4-player Tetris, the game excited me more so in that it was designed by Dr. Reiner Knizia, a prolific board game designer.
His games may not hold my #1 board game title, but they are all intricately detailed and great, and are easily some of the best out there.Okay, so enough of that mumbo-jumbo.
FITS is remarkably fun, even if you've played Tetris all your life (which I have).
It has 4 different rounds, and the rounds become more difficult each time.
Dr. Knizia makes the game interesting by making empty spaces in the tiles good and bad, depending on which round you play.
The pieces themselves are a combination of Tetris and Blokus pieces (which are themselves enhanced Tetris pieces) and are very sturdy.
They make a nice ""clink"" sound when you hit them together.
The player boards are good, and they even hold the pieces inside when storing.The instructions could've been a wee bit clearer for the first couple rounds, but my sister and I picked up quickly.
And that's the only drawback I have to the game: it's short.
With only 4 rounds, my sister and I played a full game in about 15-20 minutes, and that's with reading the instructions and all.
It could be a good thing if you're looking for a quick game to play, and all players know how Tetris works.
The extra rules aren't that hard to learn."
This game asks you to manage shapes on a board similar to tetris.
Because this is a physical game and not an electronic one, there are some variations, and these variations keep the game interesting and fun.
The game progresses through multiple stages, and at different stages, you have different goals in managing the shapes that you place on the board--sometimes, you need to cover up special spaces, sometimes you need to leave those spaces open.
Planning is key, and improvisation is also important.
This game was a hit with my kids (ages 7-8) and with my teenage nephews and nieces.
I had a pretty good time as well, and we'll put this game into our rotation.
First of all, I love Ravensburger products.
We own several games and puzzles from the company and every single one is very high quality and worth the price.
If you're looking for puzzles that won't fray and fall apart and games that have pieces that hold up against children, I would definitely recommend their products.We played this particular game (much like Tetris) with an 9 and 10 year old and they easily understood the concept.
I think we could have played it fairly easily with younger children without much difficulty with their understanding.
It was a fun game, great for the whole family to play in about 30 minutes.I loved that it helped to teach the importance of strategizing, thinking ahead, and thinking deeper than just a current move.
Definitely keeping this in the list for our family game nights.
This game is the same principle as Tetris.
You draw cards to determine the next piece you place.
There are four different templates you can put under the pieces that change the scoring a bit.
You then add up the scores which could be good math practice for kids.
I like playing it solo and seeing if I can end up with no blank spaces.
FITS is a puzzle solving game.
Think Take It Easy!, BITS, Ubongo, or to really push the definition .
.
.
Bingo.
If you enjoy puzzle solving games then this is a four star game.
If you don't enjoy puzzle solving games then you probably won't enjoy FITS.FITS is based on Tetris, but if you're expecting this to be Tetris: The Board Game you're going to be disappointed.
One reason is that the game lacks the tension you get in a video game.
More than one reviewer has commented that this is what they're looking for.
If that's the case, throw in a timer.
Each player, for example, can get 15 seconds to place their piece and then you have move on.
Or you could have the player who places their piece first flip the next card and make the game end when the first person has completed their board.
Either of these will definitely spice the game up.But FITS does function just fine on its own - for the right kind of player.
Again, do you enjoy a game with little interaction on the board while each person tries to solve a puzzle?
I'm all about judging games for what they are, not for what they aren't.
This is why I give the game four stars.
It is a very slow and rather boring game.
It is very simple and may be fun for children, but there is no real challenge to this game.
The other board levels try to give some variation, but are not enough to make it exciting.
This game is fun for adults to play with kids, and that isn't so common.
We play with our 9yo granddaughter, and we enjoy the game as much as she does.
I recommend this one.
