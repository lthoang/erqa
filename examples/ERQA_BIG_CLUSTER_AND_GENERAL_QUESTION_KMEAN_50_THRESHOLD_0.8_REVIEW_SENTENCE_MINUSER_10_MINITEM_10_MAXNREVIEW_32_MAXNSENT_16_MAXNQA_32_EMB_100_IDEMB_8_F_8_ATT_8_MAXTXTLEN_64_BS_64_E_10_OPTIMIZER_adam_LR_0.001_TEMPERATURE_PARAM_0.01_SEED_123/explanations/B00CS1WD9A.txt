Reviews:
We have the original Leapster, LeapPad, Leapster Explorer GS, and my kids like this one best of all.+Big ScreenCool games (the Pet care game is upgraded... you can choose your pet and there are more features)Built in batteryDurableWiFi - don't have to connect it to the computer (big time saver for parents because connecting to the computer is not reliable/buggy)-Nothing so far!Overall, great product and very happy to have it.
Lots of fun and a good upgrade over previous Leap products.
My daughter has a LeapPad 2 that she uses daily.
When I saw the ultra tablet, I was excited to get it for her.When it arrived I was surprised at how heavy it was.
I think it is mine only, but it is not made that well.
I can press the right side and the plastic goes up and down, it is fine on the left side.
I immediately was on the hunt for a cover for this heavy tablet.
I read a lot of reviews for the LeapPad ultra gel skin, at the time, did not have favorable reviews.
People said it fell out of their hands and also did not fit the tablet.
I then decided to get a leather case, like the one I got for her first one, theNew LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra Learning Tablet 2013 GREEN Leather Case Cover Wallet with Built in Stand - Accessories by InventCase & Exclusive to Sunny Savers.
The case I bought was poorly made.
It does not cover the Ultra tablet well and is very thin and cheap.
Also, the holes do not line up.
I am hoping with time there will be a good case for this tablet.Compared to my daughters LeapPad 2, this does have twice the memory and built in rechargeable batteries which I did not have with her first one but eventually added on.
It has a large display area but I don't think that matters to her.
Here are my pros and cons:Pros:* Built in rechargeable batteries* Double the memory* Easy to set up* Game cartridges are the same size, do not have to buy different versionsCons:* Volume buttons are not as easy to navigate along with power button, they are on the front of the LeapPad 2.
* Battery charger are different, would have been nice to have universal for LeapPad2* Heavy and awkward for any size hands, I prefer the LeapPad2 size in my daughter's handsI keep both of them charged and accessible to my daughter.
She has had the Ultra for weeks now but prefers the LeapPad2; it is easy for her hands and fingers.
Pros:physical design appears rugged & it has some larger buttonsIncludes choice of one app from limited listBundled basic apps offer functionality & fun but not long termCons:Physically heavy (at least for my arthritic hands & arms).Value (or lack there of)Wi-Fi worked for one day and then stopped.
Have not been able to get it working again.Includes choice of one app from limited listApps from leapfrog's app market very expensive (compared to apps for ios and androidThe value of leapfrog leap pad ultra learning tablet is extremely low and limited.
This is not a more budget conscious kid friendly version of an android or even an Apple iPad tablet.
To me this feels like one of those learning laptops with the little black-and-white LCD screens that were made by VTECH, only with a tablet look that makes kids feel like they have grown-up technology, when, in reality, they are using a child's toy with a mildly techy facade.
And our home the leap pad ultra was used with a fair amount of excitement for an hour or so and then it was just left in the toybox because we can't afford a $7.99 or $30 app and the Wi-Fi was spotty at best (our home Wi-Fi is fairly predictable and doesn't cut out often but the leapfrog just wouldn't communicate nicely after that first hour or so, even though our other wifi devices were chatting away, at their usual speed).My advice is to look at other tablets AND the more rugged cases available for the tablet you choose.
The value of the leap pad ultra is minimal the price you will pay for apps and the inability to scale it up as your child grows, without breaking the bank.
What I like so much about it tablets we regularly use at home, is that I can customize them for my son; I can add apps that are appropriate for him & I can set parental restrictions.
The value, the monetary cost, when considering hardware & software purchases lead me to believe that LeapPad Ultra is not a good value, or a bargain, when compared to more expensive hardware because in comparing, side by side, they are probably around equal cost, but LeapPad Ultra has a sort of planned obsolescence built in, in regards to growth and functionality as a child grows and developes, The operation of non-LeapFrog tablets is also more educational because kids are learning how to use a tool/tools that they will likely be using for the rest of their lives,  in some capacity.I realize how LeapFrog makes money with products such as this.
Obviously, it's the consumables, and not the initial purchase of the device, that are there bread-and-butter.
I do wish they would've considered the technological savvy and the technology education needed by kids today, in designing their business model for the leap pad ultra as well as the operating system.
Perhaps someday there will be a firmware update that makes this product inherently more usable and scalable for kids of all ages while remaining appropriate and protected.
OL PC did it with their XO laptop and now I believe they're going to do it with their tablet.
I'm just surprised that it seems that leapfrog hasn't looked at other available technologies and similar products to try to figure out how to blow them out of the water.
Instead They have pretty much stuck to the same principles of their other products have which are fine (don't get me wrong we have a few LeapFrog products that My son & I adore) but that also doesn't make this a modern tablet and I think many kids especially ones over the age of five will see that this is a toy and it's not really a tablet and the functionality is limited.
We have had a lot of LeapFrog products around our house, it's the one brand I usually buy when buying 'game' systems and stuff.
But they always had things that I didn't like about them.
I hate when you have to have batteries that go dead super fast (or buy the battery pack you can recharge, but it's way expensive), or I've had some that the touch screen never really worked very well.
I also didn't like that our original LeapPad we have had such a small screen.
This one didn't have any of those issues.
This comes with the regular rechargeable type batteries you'd find in any phone or tablet.
And they last awhile because we took it on a day trip where the kids played with it in the car for many hours and it lasted the full day with still some battery left.
While I still feel the touch screen could use some improvement, it's just not as sensitive as it should be, it is better than the previous products we've had.
The screen on this one is much larger than the other LeapPad's and the whole thing just feels sturdier, like it could be thrown around a bit and not be damaged (it has gotten tossed around a little, but not too much).I loved that I could hook this up to wi-fi and log into my account and it automatically put the games I had bought for the previous systems, onto this device.
These are the app games, not the ones you buy at the store.
The system allowed us to get one game for free as well and it had a much improved camera and video app.
You could also take pictures of people and then put those pictures onto animals, so you'd see an animal with the persons eyes (for example).
It was something that entertained my kids for hours, and it was included with the system with no extra money needed.
I hate when I have to buy all the games or activities in order for a system to be any good, so this was good- it came with enough stuff that it kept my kids very entertained on our trip.
I think the camera is something that never really gets old.You can also use the games (the ones you buy from the store) from the original LeapPad and another system we have (I don't recall which, but it's several years old) so I'm happy that those won't go to waste.
(I seriously hate when I have to buy new games every single time we get a new system, so this is a major plus.
"We have used many LeapFrog products in our home for our children.
From the Tag system to the popular Leapster Explorer and LeapPad 1, we're experienced LeapFrog parents.The LeapPad Ultra was a terrific upgrade to the LeapPad systems.
My kindergarten-aged daughter is using it, and she is fascinated with it.
Any technical educational product that can engage a child's interest over time and grow with them, is worth looking into.I was immediately impressed with the weight, feel, and durability of this tablet.
It is not a completely plastic casing like the LeadPads were, but it is a weighty metal construction with a rechargeable battery that is built in and not an add-on.
The add-on rechargeable battery pack was the very first accessory we bought for the Leapster Explorer!
It was thoughtful to have that already part of the package.As a parent, I have made good use of the Parent tools in LeapFrog Connect.
Using Connect, I can configure the games to use the particular math skills being taught in her classroom that week, and even test her on her weekly spelling words.
The customization available is a terrific asset, and a large advantage to this product.As I have come to expect from LeapFrog products, going from box to play was easy.
I plugged it in, to charge the battery, and turned it on.
A set up process walked me through configuring the LeapPad, and we were off and running.
I did run into a problem where the WiFi was not seeing our home network.
The online Support did not fix my problem.
The online Support said to make sure your network was not having an issue.
Being network engineers, I can assure you, our network was not the problem!
Multiple devices were running on our WiFi while the LeapPad could not even find the network.
The Newest LeapPad Ultra is more expensive that the other LeapPad versions have been (or are currently) but I think it has some great features to offer.
Here are the features of the new LeapPad Ultra compared to the LeapPad 2 tablet:7-inch backlit Light-touch screen (compared to 5-inch backlit Resistive touch screen)1024x600 Resolution (compared to 480 x 272)800 MHz Processor speed (compared to 550 MHz)8GB memory built-in (compared to 4GB)Wi-Fi with kid-safe Web (no other LeapPad has had Wi-Fi)Motion sensor2MP camera and 480p video recording (compared to 240p video recording) - Oh and there is a camera on the front and backMP3 Player Built-In (previously it was sold seperately)Includes 11 apps - $80 value (compared to 5 apps and $40 value)Up to 9 hour battery lifeAC-adapter included (not included previously)Peer-to-Peer Play (this is completely new to the Ultra)Learning Path & Parent settings online12-month warrantyOverall, I am loving the new LeapPad Ultra.
It truly is a tablet that can grow with your kids and my son who is almost 7 doesn't think its babyish, which I know some worry about.
I think the only thing that LeapFrog can add really is to open up the Wi-Fi to approved by parents apps (my boys do miss Angry Birds from our iPad which is not available on the LeapPad.)
LeapSearch contains Categories for kids to click on as well as Videos and Pictures but again its all safe content.I received this product to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.
We have the leappad2, as well as ipod touch, iphone 5, ipads, nintendo ds, and some consoles.
So our 7 and 9 year old have played on a variety of units, including ones more geared toward adults and older kids.The Leappad 2 my 7 year old received for Christmas last year.
It is still getting used 9 months later and still holding up well.
My daughter likes the music playing function and camera's on it.
She and my 9 year old son though still play games on it as well.
Screen size, resolution, and replaceable batteries are its biggest drawbacks.The Leappad Ultra addresses those three main concerns.
Bigger screen, more resolution, and built in batteries.
This one went to my 9 year old son.
It set up easily over Wi-Fi and took about 2 hours to fully charge.
First day we had a car trip and between playing at home prior to the trip and the 4 hour trip, the battery lasted about 8 hours.
It takes the same cartridges we already had for the Leappad 2 so he had plenty to do.
He has never complained about any lag time or any other issues in the week he has had it now.
It seems fairly robust and hopefully will hold up as well as the Leappad 2 has.
He says he likes it a lot and he is on the older end of the spectrum.
He still likes the other choices he has and won't choose the Ultra exclusively, but he does play it get a lot of use from it so far.
Like his Nintendo DS, the biggest drawback is game prices.
"LeapFrog's LeapPad Ultra Learning Tablet is another winner from one of our favorite companies.
The display is beautiful and easy on the eyes.
This toy functions so much like a regular tablet, that kids are thrilled to have one ""Just like Dad's"".
As with all of LeapFrog's products there are tons of wonderful learning games available, some using very popular characters.As to durability, one of my grandson's LeapPad went through a housefire, was under wet, heavy insulation and debris and worked FINE when it was recovered!"
My son was very excited to get the new big leappad.
It was easy to set it up and download  the apps, and all the cartridge games from his old leappad worked there, too.
I was a bit worried they will not look very good on the bigger screen with higher resolution, but they were just fine.
Nice crisp pictures.Our favorite game is Mr Pencil saves Doodleberg, and my son mostly played this game.
The new leapppad is not only bigger, but also it is more sensitive to touch, and it was sometimes frustrating when my son would try to write with the stylus, and accidentally touch the screen with the base of his hand or with his other hand.
Another favorite was Thomas the train interactive book.Unfortunately, the leappad broke just after one week of use - the screen shattered.
The good news - it is covered with a plastic film, and there were no sharp pieces.
The device was still able to turn on.
I contacted LeapFrog company, and they told me that accidents like that are not covered by warranty, but they would replace the leappad for us this one time.
I was really impressed by that, didn't expect them to do it.
They had me write return authorization number on the screen, make a picture and email it to them.
Then they sent me a return label.
Hope the new one comes fast.
I am not sure what exactly happened to the leappad (maybe my son dropped something on the screen?)
and why did it broke, is it because the new bigger screen is more fragile?
The previous smaller leappad is still alive with the same (rough) kid user.
I love all things LeapFrog.
LeapFrog makes learning fun and it helps teachers and parents with the repetitive tasks that many children use to learn.
It has the added benefit of being interactive which involves children in their learning.This LeapPad is extremely easy to set up.
It has the added benefit of being able to be charged while you are setting up the information for each child.
In the old days we would get ready to start and it would say come back in # hours when it is done charging.
The charge cord makes it usable right out of the box.Five steps:Power upSet up (connect to wifi)RegisterSelect and download gamesPlayThe LeapPad Ultra is larger than the earlier LeapPads and is set up to be more Padlike.
It has Wifi, camera, movie, and ArtStudio.
You can chat with other friends who have LeapPads.
And eventually it will have internet.
This wasn't an issue for us yet but I hope it will be operational soon.The most amazing part here was that I was able to download tons of apps that I had already purchased once I signed into my account in the store.
I have never figured out how to do this before.
One game = one game unit.The only tiff I have with this system is the proprietary nature of all of the apps.
You can not add your own content or books to it.I think this will continue to be problematic because parents can buy tables or pads for about the same amount of money, or less, and still have control over the children's contents.
But generic tablets have a larger number of apps available and some competitive pricing.
As long as LeapFrog continues to keep their dedicated systems they are going to lose out on the crowd who CAN read.Oh, andDear LeapFrog,You know the Scrub-a-dub station where the children take their pet into the bath-carwash?
Please stop having them blow in the microphone to activate the dryer.
This was a birthday present for our youngest son, and he loves it.
Battery life seems to be a complaint with them, however that is with non-stop use, so it's somewhat expected.There are two features that I find disappointing- the load times for games and the home screen, and the use of a mini-usb adapter rather than the now-standard micro-usb adapter.Overall the kids are happy, so I can't complain.
WE really love this product.
I love the educational games and products that are made by Leapfrog.
They really know how to make learning fun.
This product is a step up from the Leappad2.
It has a 7 inch screen instead of the 5 inch and has higher resolution.
It also has a faster processor and storage on the device jumps from 4MB to 8MB.
Also like the fact that it has a rechargeable battery as I disliked having to keep replacing the batteries on the other Leappads.
I also like the fact that the games for the other Leappads will work on this one.
They offer lots of different games and ebooks that are for different ages.
Again my family really likes these products and will continue to buy products offered by Leapfrog.
My only problem is that I wish they would have put in a better camera but that is not a big problem.
Maybe next time.
"Having three children, we have owned various LeapFrog devices over the years.
In the world where Apple seems to dominate personal electronics, I was curious if the LeapPad Ultra Learning Tablet filled a niche that was not currently covered by an Apple iSomething or other.Being nearly 40 years old, I am well outside the manufactures suggested age range of 4 to 9 years old, so my test subjects were my three children, aged 10, 7, and 6.
All three children currently utilize iPod touches and an iPad.
The oldest also has a Kindle.Prior to giving the LeapPad Ultra to the children, I decided I better check it out first.
Initial configuration for Wi-Fi and setting up the kids profiles were quite easy for my wife and I.
We did not have much difficulty in figuring out any aspect of the setup of the device or an individual profileWe handed it over to the children and let them play with it for a month.
Despite my children having access to more expensive electronics, the LeapPad Ultra Learning Tablet was still a hit.
The biggest hit was the game ""Pet"" that came with the tablet.
Evidently, the app is a game where you can build a home for your pet.
I admit I have not actively played with this app, but to me it looked like a simplistic version of the WebKinz website.
As I said, I have not played with the app that much, so I could be way off.
The kids liked it though.I spent some time with the LeapPad Ultra Tablet to ensure I had some feel for the device.
One of the things I noticed right away is that compared to other personal electronics, whatever this device does, it does it slow.
It is slow to load, slow to launch an app, and slow to turn off.
I examined the LeapSearch internet area.
I was a bit disappointed that there was not some sort of web browsing capabilities on the tablet.
"We've come a long way from the initial 2gb storage with the first LeapPad model!
With 8gb now, you can easily have hundreds of apps on the LeapPad.
We took full advantage of the back to school sale on apps and filled it up with a range of skills for everyone.
I love that you can customize settings, allowing only the content you want.
While the built in browser is already kid safe, it's nice to know that I can turn that off when I really just want them to play games and work on skills.
The new, bigger screen is beautiful and the resolution has improved greatly.
Games look much better now, even older titles.
I loved that I could just plug the Ultra into my Mac, where I already have the LeapFrog software downloaded, and all our purchased content was right there for transfer to the new device.
So easy!
The software itself seems to have improved as well, as I felt more informed about the progress of what was going on rather than just seeing that it was ""syncing.""
I can see which titles are being transferred and a percentage is given to show how far along it is, which is very helpful with antsy children waiting to play!While the overall unit feels quite a bit heavier than older models, it's still about the weight of a 1st generation iPad.
It seems to be okay for the kiddos as they can still play for hours without complaining, but I was concerned at first that it was too heavy for little hands.
They have improved the design with rubbery texture on all the black areas that you see, making it much more grippable.
This was always a gripe with the previous models.
They were just so smooth and slippery!
This addition is very nice.
"We have countless Leapfrog toys they make great fun/educational stuff.
This has been a wonderful upgrade for my daughter from her Leap Pad2 which is much smaller with far less features.
They are similar as in both have front/back cameras,attached stylus/come with similar preloaded apps and have countless apps, and skins and accessories available.They are however different in that the Ultra is faster yeah, bigger but not too heavy and huge yeah!!
and has some limited internet access.
It has held a charge for about 5/6 hours so far.
It may go longer but we plug it in often when not in use.My daughter was starting to use my Kindle and her brothers tablet more than her old Leap pad so this upgrade was awesome in that way.
I will add this was giving to me free for an honest review and I thought it was a bit pricey all things considered for the price $150.00 you can get a ""real"" tablet but I think I would still choose this as Leap Frogs products hold up to rough handling/drops/spills from the kiddies not sure other tablets are built for that.
So I would be inclined to choose this maybe by Christmas it will drop in price and improve some of the firmware many people have been having problems luckily not us(yet)."
"First, this tablet has its limitations.
The camera is really poor quality.
The device is really slow.
The Leapfrog dude's voice is, as always, annoying.It took about 20 minutes to set up, which isn't too horrible.
You can only input 3 users.
(It will show 3 user profiles and 1 guest profile.
If you have more than 3 kids, somebody just has to play as the guest.
)Now, you get 11 apps.
Yay!
Right?
No.
Not so much.
10 of the apps are preloaded.
Without them, this thing wouldn't really do anything.
So I don't see why they are advertised as a perk, when clearly they are a necessary function of the toy.
I guess we should be praising LeapFrog for not making us buy absolutely everything.
I bought my grandson a leapPad last year and he loved it, so I got him the LeapPad Ultra Tablet.
It is compatible with the LeapPad cartridges and you can download the apps you have on your childs LeapPad onto the Tablet.
It is another great product from LeapFrog.
My grandson loves it and has no problems operating it.
He didn't even need instructions.
The games are fun, as well as, educational, so everyone wins.
"This product was designed for parents who are sick of their young kids taking over their smart phones or iPads.
That's the theory anyway.
Here is how it fares in reality:*Hardware*The screen on this is great, probably the best in the entire Leapfrog line.
Puts the Leap Pad 2 to shame because it's so much bigger and higher definition.Feels sturdy.
The box claims it is ""drop tested.""
This is important because my kid is Mr. Butterfingers but since we've had it, he hasn't dropped it once, which is amazing.
It does have some grippy plastic along the back and sides, which probably helps.I *really* like that I don't have to mess with batteries.
Every night, we plug it in and it's ready in the morning.
If we have to recharge it mid-day, it doesn't take long.Wireless is a feature doesn't seem to bring much benefit.
All the videos are jumpy and slow to load.
If you click on the icon for the web, it says ""Coming soon!
""*Software*Comes with more apps than the Leap Pad2, some of which are totally useless.
The Pet Chat app is one.
It requires other children to have this exact app on the Leapfrogs and be in the same room.
And then they can't even chat normally, there's only an assortment of pre-written texts that they can choose from such as ""Hi!""
and ""I ate too much.""
"The Leap Pad Ultra is clearly meant to be a product designed to carve out a niche in the tablet market.
While many of us have seen the spoiled youngsters in the supermarket or at the restaurant tapping away on their own iPad, it's unrealistic to think that every kid should own one or that parents need to buy them for their kids.
Personally, I think it's ridiculous to stick a $500, high-tech computer into the dirty, careless and irresponsible hands of a toddler.
But, that's a whole other topic...The Leap Pad is made to look like a tablet computer for kids, and that's just what it is.
It has a very large touch screen, wi-fi connectivity, downloadable apps, a video recorder/camera, a calculator, and music player.
Like previous ""Leap"" products, this product is designed to be durable in the hands of children.
It has a solid feel in your hands and boasts the familiar green-and-white coloration of most of its predecessors.
My family has owned three other Leap Frog products, and we have always been happy with them.
Like all of the others, this one can work through a battery pretty quickly.
(The packaging says it has a 9-hour life, but I would say that 8 is more realistic!)
At least this product has its own rechargeable battery so we don't have to purchase that separately.
That is a nice upgrade!Most of the apps that you can purchase for this Leap Pad have at least SOME educational value.
Sure, there are some that are purely for entertainment, but I think Leap Frog seems committed to marketing this product on the established foundation that their devices are first and foremost for fun, but educational purposes.
One feature I can appreciate about this new LeapPad is that it can run all of the apps we previously purchased for the Leap Pad 2.
While these games may now be ""old"" and have lost some of their appeal, at least we didn't have to start from scratch to build a new game library.
No more mini-cartridges to keep track of!
My 5-year old and I were eager to give the new LeapPad Ultra a try and compare it to the LeapPad 2 which we already owned and loved.
Straight out of the box the tablet is noticeably heavier and clunkier feeling than the LP2.
I realize they were trying to make this version bigger and feel more like an adult's tablet but for little hands it can be a bit much - I think it would have more appeal to older kids.Since we already had an account set up with LeapFrog, all I had to do was run LeapFrog connect and sync the tablet which took nearly 30 minutes - be prepared to spend some time on this when you first get it, especially if you are not already registered with LeapFrog.Once the tablet was synced my daughter didn't waste any time exploring and checking out all of the features.
The tablet comes with 11 apps - my daughter really enjoys the Pet Pad Party and the MP3 player and the kid-safe search browser.
It definitely feels to her like she has a tablet like Mommy and Daddy's now.
My biggest complaint is that compared to the LP2 this one seems painfully slow.
Anytime you click/tap on the screen to go to a new app or change something, or when you turn the tablet on or off it seems to take forever.
The LP2 was not nearly this slow.My favorite feature of the tablet is by far the rechargeable battery - after about 8 hours of use we can plug it in and charge it, so nice to not have to keep buying batteries!
I also really like the little hidden compartment to slide the stylus into.
The camera and video features are easy and fun to use - my daughter had no problem figuring these out fairly quickly.We were very disappointed to learn that the Hello Kitty game app that we had downloaded just a few weeks earlier for the LP2 was not (yet) compatible with the LeapPad Ultra.
While most of the apps are compatible with the LPU, be aware that not all of them are.
I made a comment on LeapFrog's Facebook page about the problem and they commented that they are still working on making all of the existing apps compatible and in the near future we should be able to use the app we had purchased on the new tablet.
Encouraging news, but frustrating when we had just paid $20 for an app that didn't get played much before the upgrade to the newer tablet.
This is the only game we've encountered with this problem, although there may be others - check the game description before buying the apps.We have not had any issues with charging the tablet or using the Wi-fi connection, no freezing or crashing as long as you are patient with how slow the tablet moves.My daughter said she prefers the LeapPad Ultra over the LeapPad 2.
If it weren't for how incredibly slow the LeapPad Ultra is, I would agree 100%.
Children's wants are obviously different from the parents, so take everything into consideration before making a purchase.
"We've owned the original LeapPad, LeapPad2, and recently the LeapPad2 Power.
We've also owned the InnoTab and InnoTab2S.
Our favorite has been the LeapPad2.
But then in walked the LeapPad Ultra .
.
.SO, HOW ARE LEAPPAD2 AND LEAPPAD ULTRA THE SAME?- Both have a front and back camera.
On the LPU it's now placed to the left and off to the side.- Both use a stylus.
On the LPU it's placed on the bottom instead of the side.
This helps with the whole left-hand right-hand dilemma.- Both have a cartridge port for additional games, and uses purchased apps.
Previously owned games will transfer once you register, and old LeapPad cartridges will fit.- Both come with preloaded apps.
The LPU comes with 11 apps, the LP2 only 5.
When you register your LPU you get one free app (pick one of 3 preselected apps, not any app in their app store - bummer!
).- Both have additional accessories you can buy like gel skins, carrying cases, ac adapters (now included with the LPU), and headphones.- Both have a mic, and volume (now moved to the top right side of the tablet, I find it awkward here).
I couldn't find a contrast button on the LP2--it's very bright.HOW ARE LEAPPAD2 AND LEAPPAD ULTRA DIFFERENT?- LP2 has an age requirement of 3-9 years.
LPU is upped to 4-9 years.- Faster processor.
However, the LP2 took 5 seconds from the time you selected an app to load.
"Having had the LeapPad and LeapPad2 I was excited about the LeapPad Ultra.
It's still just as fun to use as the former and the excitement is still there but, after using it for a few days, it's more tempered.The improvements?1) The screen.
Much bigger and much better resolution than the other LeapPads.
Also gone is the plasticky covering for the screen.
This makes for a crisper display and hopefully it will withstand little hands poking at it with/without stylus.2) Batteries.
There's now a built in rechargeable battery which means kids can now be in charge (pun intended) of keeping it full as it's much easier to plug in the AC adapter compared to having them try to remove/recharge/replace the old AA batteries.The letdowns?1) The ""web"" part.
I was looking forward to having something similar to the functionality provided by Microsoft's Family Safety but instead you just get a set of categories (animals, sports, plants, etc.)
and within those you can look at some (preselected?!)
videos and pictures.
More so, I tried some of the videos and after a minute or so the playback slowed down to a crawl (and even caused the LeapPad to restart).
Clearly this area needs some work to get the most out of the WiFi capability.2) The speed.
I was hoping for the Ultra to be faster than the LeapPad2 but it's about the same (if not slower at least for screen changes) as the LeapPad2.
This is not bad but one can ask for more, right?A final note, the Ultra feels a lot heavier than the predecessors.
It's not comfortable to hold just in your hands for a long time.
It needs to either be on a table or rest on one's lap."
If you and your child have never used a standard tabled such as an iPad, Kindle Fire, or Google Nexus this product might be alright.
But if you've used a real tablet you probably won't like this.
It's slow, glitchy, and has bad graphics.
And seeing as you can get tablets for not much more I don't see the point in buying this.
Also, apps for this are expensive.
Most of them run $15.
I was hoping my three year old might like this LeapPad and let me have my iPad back.
But when she plays on the LeapPad it is so slow she gets frustrated and asks for my iPad anyway.
"If you have kids who have been using Leapfrog's various game platforms, especially the LeapPad, the Ultra extends the usable life of the platform for your child a bit longer by making it more tablet like.
A larger screen with higher resolution and wifi to connect to the internet (what appears to be a very limited browser was still in development when I last checked) give older kids more to play with.A notable difference between the Ultra and regular LeapPads is that the Ultra has a built-in, non-changeable rechargable battery.
It generally lasts a long time and charges relatively quickly (several hours) but could present a problem for long trips.As a parent, when setting up the Ultra you are prompted to log in with a PIN so be sure to write this down or use something memorable.
This allows the parents access to the store but keeps kids from making unapproved purchases and changes to the account.
In essence, this step takes the place of downloading and installing LeapFrog Connect.
Once connected, you have access to apps for the Ultra as well as any other applicable apps that may have worked on the smaller LeapPads.
This is a nice touch - some companies might not allow something as simple as sharing apps like this.
What bugged me was that there is no way to tell what has been already downloaded or is downloading.
All apps available in your account are simply marked ""Download"" and don't change once chosen.As an adult, I find I'm annoyed by some things kids don't seem to care about - so take these from that angle.
The on-screen keyboard is *very* sensitive and lead to many mistypes, which was especially frustrating while setting up our wifi password.
Swiping between screens is a hit and miss affair.
Sometimes you get it to swipe, sometimes not and you wind up opening an app.These issues are minor.
As an adult you expect more - you would rip Apple to shreds for behavior like this on an iPad.
Your kids will love it, however, just like mine do - they don't notice these minor problems.
It's bigger, brighter, bolder, better in almost every way.
It needs a firmware update to smooth out some rough edges, and I'm betting that will come some time soon to help spur good reviews in time for the holidays."
I have a 4 and 8 year old.
We have the monsters leappad2 as well as the ultra.
Not surprisingly, they both prefer the bigger screen and creative features.
The applications compared to the smaller versions are almost three times the size.This allows my 4 year old to see the pictures clearer, but it also makes dragging a little more difficult since he has to hold down the bigger piece longer and move his arm more.
I'm not negative over this since it give him the exercises he needs to build strength.
(He is a true ambidextrous and without a favored hand, both are not as strong as if he chose one over the other)My eight year old loves the record-able mic and creative art sections.
He also uses the notepad, which is like a Microsoft Word sheet, which you have the option to save.
I usually have him practice his spelling words on that without protest.
No need to buy rechargeable batteries or a recharger pack, it comes with a charger that can also stay plugged into the wall as well as a usb plug to sinc with a computer or use with a car adapter (sold separately) for car rides.Since both my boys are still very young, I have not taken advantage of the wifi feature, for safety reasons.
The boys do not know any differently and there is no difference of the games on either of the leappads.
Will update when I activate the feature.I do recommend buying a screen protector for the tablet.XtremeGUARD Screen Protector (Ultra CLEAR) For LeapFrog LEAPPAD ULTRA.
I have to say I am loving the new Leappad Ultra, my Son may not be getting this one back (Just Kidding).At $149 the Ultra is not cheap, it's almost in the price range of a Nexus 7 but the Nexus 7 would open up your kids to a whole world of things that you might not want them to see.
The Leappad ultra is a Kids safe device that allows internet access and many other activities but only on sites that are Kid safe and it can only download kid safe learning apps and games.Out of the Box The Ultra is impressive, it's Heavy, it's solid and it certainly feels like something that will last.
I suspect Leapfrog knows this and that's why they give you a full 1 year warranty.
When have you bought a Toy for your Kid that came with a 1 year warranty?
?Powering up the Ultra you instantly notice a super bright screen with pretty good resolution and Color.
It beat all my expectations for screen quality instantly.The next thing was connecting it to my Wifi network which was surprisingly easy and painless.
It pretty much uses the standard screens you see with all devices so you should have no problems.
Next you setup your kids account and set that magic 4 digit Pin code that prevents them from purchasing Apps and Games without getting your consent.
All of this worked really well and on top of that you get one free app.
Most  apps are in the $5+ range, which sounds expensive but it's not because kids will play each one of these games for days and days and the best part is that they are designed to teach not just entertain so it's money well spent.Quick Technical Specs:2 cameras, front and back (2 Mega pixels but they do take pretty good pictures)Boasts 9 Hour battery life but my son gets about 7Mp3 Player that pretty good and can get fairly loud.Built in stylus with strapFirmware is auto upgradeable via the WiFiReally rugged design, that's well thought out and very nice looking.Negatives:I did see a few lookups of the unit, not too many that I would worry and Leappfrog has already sent a firmware update that fixed some of that, so I expect by Christmas it should be very stable.Final Comments:If you can afford it, get it!
I suspect that this unit is going to be this year's hot Christmas seller.
It's really good, the screens are clear and bright, the games are fully interactive and it really talks up a storm and gives the kids a lot of enjoyable interaction.BTW Ultra owners can play along with other kids that have an Ultra and they can chat to them.
Overall a very good investment that should last a long time, this is not some toy that will be put down 2 months later, this is the kind of toy a kid will use for a long time.
I was sorely disappointed in this product.
The preloaded apps aren't terribly fun for kids.
Why do they need a voice memo app?
And the camera isn't very fun either.
The two apps we played were the MyPets app, but it has limited functionality, and the Art Studio app which is fun to draw and color.
The touch screen seemed to have issues as I had to press over and over again several times.
I went to the app store to buy more apps and found the prices to be $10-25.
And a lot of them were just episodes of TV shows.
I am returning this and buying a Kindle Fire for my daughter.
She can get tons of free apps and it has parental locks.
Plus, with Prime I can get tons of TV shows for free.
"This tablet is more comparable in size to a standard tablet.
It is a definite size improvement over the LeapPad 2.
I would say that it has almost twice the screen size.
I also like that the stylus slides into a hole rather than snapping into a groove like on the LeapPad 2.
It's much easier to keep the pen locked in place.==Pros==*Wi-fi is probably the most noticeable improvement on this device.
It's wonderful to be able to access the app center or the parent area without having to plug the LeapPad into the computer.
*Built-in rechargable battery with included cord(this is a MUST)*Larger screen size.
*Design seems more ergonomic and easier to grip and hold.
*Web Search and App Store features can be disabled in the Parent Center if you don't want your children to have access to them.
*Compatible with all of the games for the LeapPad 2.
I was able to sync the apps we previously had purchased for the Leap Pad2 and use them on the new LeapPad Ultra.
*Kid/User-friendly - my boys were able to easily figure out how to customize the leap pad.
*Durable - We've had this for about a month and in that time it has been dropped, banged on the floor, tossed in the bottom of a bag, and it's still up and running.
Durability is pretty important when kids are involved and so far everything is still good!==Cons==*The load time is sometimes a little slow.
Plan on it taking a good while to load the apps onto the device.
*My son loves the web search feature (it's essentially just pre-selected you tube videos).
"Leapfrog has always been one of the front runners when it comes to children's educational technology.
Now they bring you their second generation children's tablet, the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra.
Unlike the previous Leapad, and Leappad 2, the Leappad Ultra truly in my opinion deserves the description ""Tablet"".
Like all previous editions the tablet is touch screen compatible, it comes with one styluses (which is attached to the tablet itself), AC Adapter, and a LeapFrog USB adapter so that you can connect it to your PC and download applications directly from the Leapfrog Server Website as well as charge the Tablet itself.The tablet is medium-lightweight and easy for a child or adult to carry from place to place.
It is backwards compatible with all Leapfrog Explorer cartridge games as well as most original Leappad downloads (I don't believe the micromods work with the Leappad Ultra) .
The Leapfrom Downloads are extremely child friendly and great for any child ages 3-10.
My 6 year old daughter absolutely loves this and plays it a couple hours a day, as well as my 3 year old son.
This has not only increased both of my children's vocabulary but has taught my daughter how to trace letters and now she's writing very well as well as improved her addition and subtraction.I absolutely love this as an extra educational aid, and now they've finally fixed my one big issues with the previous models which was the constant use of batteries.
The Leappad Ultra like an Ipad or Android Tablet can easily be plugged into your computer to charge or use the AC adapter.
There is also a Car Charger which you can purchase separately for educational fun on the go!.
When fully charged will last up to 9 hours which is plenty of time for educational fun.So what's the difference between the Leappad 2 and the Ultra?
Well The Leappad 2 and Ultra both come with front & back cameras/video recorders, however the Leappad 2 has 4gb of memory versus the 8 gb you get with the new Leappad Ultra.
Also the New Ultra has kid Safe Wifi powered by the Zui network which is limited to kid friendly topic and interests.
The Ultra also has upgraded the screen to a new 7 inch HiDef 1024x600 as well as improved the processor/computing speed.
Everything else is exactly the same.As a bonus Leapfrog gives you 11 free apps 10 are per-installed and 1 you get to choose from when you register your device.So if your kids loved the original Leappad and you're thinking about upgrading and wondering if it's worth it the answer is a Definite Yes!
And if you're new to the Leappad this is definitely the one to invest in your kids, nephews, nieces grandchildren will love it!"
My daughters love playing with my tablet and phone, so I decided to get this product because I figured if the worst happened and they destroyed the tablet they were playing on, at least it wouldn't begin with an *i*.The tablet is sturdy and well suited for younger kids.
My girls are not overly rough with it and are in general easy with their toys, so this has not been put through the worst kids can do, but its survived some bumps and drops.The main drawback is the assortment of apps that is included are not that great.
For example, one of the apps is the *welcome* message.
I realize that buying the tablet is almost the least expensive part, that buying the apps and cartridges are part and parcel of the territory, but I really do not like having this huge selling point being a large selection of apps to begin and those apps being near worthless.
Granted, there are a couple that my kids love, but overall it was a gimmick and I resent it.The other problem is loading and switching between apps and pages takes forever.
There is quite a bit of lag time, enough my kids have asked if there is anything wrong with the machine, and I need to tell them to be patient.So overall I'm not unhappy that I got this.
My kids enjoy it and I enjoy not worrying about if it gets broken or not.
Just be prepared to shell out for apps from the very beginning.
"I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter.
Like most kids her age, she is tech savvy.
She has had a LeapPad2 for several months, and now this new and improved LeapPad Ultra.
In addition, we have an iPad mini and a Kindle Fire HD.
Those devices are not hers, but she is allowed to play with them sometimes.In many ways, the LeapPad Ultra is an improvement over the LeapPad2.
The display is considerably larger, 7"" in comparison to 5"".
There is a built in rechargeable battery, very limited internet capability, double the internal memory space for apps, improved cameras, and a faster processor.
All of our old downloaded games transferred over to the LeapPad Ultra, and the cartridges that I bought for the LeapPad2 work as well.
I do think that it is rather slippery for a small child to hold, and recommend buying a case for it.Here is my issue though about ""kid"" tablets.
At the current pricing, the LeapPad Ultra costs almost as much as many ""adult"" tablets.
Here is a comparison:  As of the date of this review, the LeapPad Ultra is $149 and the 16 GB Kindle Fire HD tablet is $199 (it was just on sale recently for $30 less).
The LeapFrog content that you can purchase for the LeapPad Ultra is very good, but it is also quite expensive.
The eBooks are $10 to $20 each, and the games are $5 to $25 each.
Do a bit of math, and you will realize that the cost difference between the two previously mentioned devices will disappear quickly with some book and game purchases.
The Kindle Fire HD has a parental control program available called Kindle Free Time Unlimited.
It is currently $4.99 per month, or $2.99 per month if you are a Prime member.
With the increasing number of tablets, it is hard for something like the leap frog to compete.
They don't have near the features and apps of android or apple products.
Also the apps are very expensive, with many costing over $10.
It is durable and well made, but my 5 year old never pucks this up over the iPad
