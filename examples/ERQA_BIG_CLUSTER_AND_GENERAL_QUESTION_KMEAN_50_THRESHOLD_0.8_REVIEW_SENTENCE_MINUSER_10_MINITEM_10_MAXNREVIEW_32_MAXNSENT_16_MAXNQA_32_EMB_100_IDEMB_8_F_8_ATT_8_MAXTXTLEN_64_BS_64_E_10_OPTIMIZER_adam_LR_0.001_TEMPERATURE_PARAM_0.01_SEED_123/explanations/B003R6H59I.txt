My older son is a very good guitar player, and he was drawn to this and able to play some of his favorite heavy metal tunes with a little fooling around---that probably shocked the Disney Princesses, but it was cool to hear!
This is the perfect size for a kid between ages 3-6.When I first got it, I thought the strings would not last for more than a week but to my surprise, they are still intact even after it's been used very roughly for the past 3+ weeks.The body is also made of quality material - it does not look cheap.
I will update this review after some months to report how long-lasting this is.For now, this is really a good value for the listed price ($25).
"The sound quality in this is WAY better than I expected, and I'm shocked that the strings haven't broken because we've adjusted them several times (including our four-year-old son ""tuning"" the guitar by tightening the strings as much as he can).
This is the type of thing that would make a wonderful Christmas or birthday present.Also, it totally unboxed super easy!

Reviews:
"My five-year-old daughter has been asking for a guitar for quite some time, and when I had the chance to try out this Disney Princess ""mini guitar,"" I thought it would be great for her.
She was very excited, at first, but within a few minutes of strumming this small plastic ukulele she asked me to buy her a ""real guitar.""
There's nothing exactly wrong with this child's toy, but one should not expect it to satisfy any desires for a ""real guitar.""
It seems best suited for a three-year-old's less judgmental play time.It's pretty small for my five-year-old, and not even her intense love for Disney princesses and all things pink can make her appreciate this toy.
Parents should note that this is a four-string, relatively quiet, can be tuned (to a degree), and it's made from pretty cheap plastic, so don't expect it to last long especially if your child is rowdy with toys.
If your child, perhaps ages two to four, really loves Disney and desires a guitar, this is not a bad toy.
But be prepared to be asked for a ""real guitar"" sooner or later."
As part of my participation in the Amazon Vines program, I received this for review.I'm always hoping to encourage both of my daughters when it comes to music, but this one didn't really suit her.
She's played with it a few times, but my older daughter's cast off recorder seems to draw more of my 5 year old's interest than this guitar.
(Unfortunately, the recorder is also considerably louder.)
Even so, just because my daughter didn't care for it doesn't mean that your's won't.
Kids are like that.
As far as the guitar goes, the materials seemed strong enough and the knobs didn't loosen on their own, so that's a definite positive.
For the price listed, this is really good quality musical instrument for your preschooler.
This is the perfect size for a kid between ages 3-6.When I first got it, I thought the strings would not last for more than a week but to my surprise, they are still intact even after it's been used very roughly for the past 3+ weeks.The body is also made of quality material - it does not look cheap.
But I'm guessing that it will get dents and scratches over time.
I will update this review after some months to report how long-lasting this is.For now, this is really a good value for the listed price ($25).
My review for this as a guitar would be 1 star, because this isn't a guitar.
It is a ukulele, so the review is of this UKULELE.First, it is small, but if you view it as a ukulele and not a guitar, the size is correct.
If you're wanting it as a play guitar, know that as a guitar it is sized for a 2 year old.
The strings are pretty bad, but they are not easily snapped, which is important in a kid's instrument.
(They tend to pluck really hard at times.)
It is made of plastic, not a traditional wood.
4 strings (because it is a ukulele) not 6 (because it is not a guitar).
It actually has decent tuners.
It has proven itself durable so far.
I think I might grab some better strings to see if we can't make some better music with it.
"The sound quality in this is WAY better than I expected, and I'm shocked that the strings haven't broken because we've adjusted them several times (including our four-year-old son ""tuning"" the guitar by tightening the strings as much as he can).
Our almost 2 year old has strummed it too, without damaging it at all.
I think other reviewers are right that this is technically a ukulele, but my daughter doesn't care about that distinction, and neither do I. :)"
The first thing I noticed is that both ends of this box were open so I'm wondering if it was a return.
There's no directions, no pick, nothing but this so called guitar.
We spent more time trying to tune this than time spent playing with it.
The plastic is thin, very thin.
Fo 25, I expected more than this.This looks and feels cheap, if you left your 2 or 3 year old alone with this, I'm most certain either the princesses would get all scratched up or they would crack the plastic.
This little guitar isn't actually a guitar---it's a ukulele!
It has 4 strings.
It's also very small, smaller than you'd probably picture.
The strings are plastic.However, all that being said, I still love this.
I love it because it's simple.
I've gotten my daughter quite a few music toys, as she is autistic and she loves music.
Most of them are pretty much ways to push buttons and play back pre-recorded music.
This is a real instrument.
You can tune it, you can strum it, you can be creative with it.
My older son is a very good guitar player, and he was drawn to this and able to play some of his favorite heavy metal tunes with a little fooling around---that probably shocked the Disney Princesses, but it was cool to hear!
And my daughter actually sits with this and strums and plays around with sounds.
It has a nice sound, even with the plastic strings, a mellow pretty sound.
It's very good to have a toy which actually is free-form and creative.
And the fact it's Disney Princesses might draw in little girls that otherwise wouldn't be drawn to guitars (or ukuleles!)
"This 4 string ukulele has a plastic body with clear plastic-like strings.
It came with un-tightened strings and sounded very plunky.
My 13-year-old, who plays violin, tuned it and picked out a few tunes.
She says that it is annoying that the pegs have to be turned in different directions on either side of the neck to change notes up or down.
I could strum it, but would not call what I was doing ""making music.""
The tuning pegs are metal with Philips head screws, so I would guess that if it loses its ""tunability,"" those could be tightened.
Not a bad little kid toy."
I agree with the other reviewers that this is most definitely a ukulele rather than a mini-guitar.
It is so adorable, and despite being made of plastic feels very durable.I did find the ukulele hard to tune (and yes, I do actually own a real ukulele and know how to tune an instrument).
I suspect this is due to the kid-friendly nylon strings.
I was able to get it close enough to in tune to make it not sound horrible (like it initially did out of the box) but it took some fiddling and a few different tries.
Also, once the uke was strummed heavily by a two year old two of the strings had jumped over and were being held with the other strings so it took some untwisting to get them back where they belonged.
Again, I think different strings and less slack would solve this problem.However, your kid probably isn't going to be the next Jack Johnson and he or she just wants something to strum, play with, make some noise with, and have fun and this totally fits the bill!
This is the type of thing that would make a wonderful Christmas or birthday present.Also, it totally unboxed super easy!
One piece of tape holds some cardboard around the neck and that's it!
It's smaller than you think.
My daughter played with this about 20 mins.
That's how long the strings lasted.
Based on that, I can't really recommend this which is strange given some of the reviews.
I just expected better.
