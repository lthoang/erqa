Top sentence(s):
Seems like it should have 2, since it is  &#34;dragstrip&#34;* The Lightning McQueen that comes with it is plastic.
The first car to reach the end causes the flag to fall in its direction and the cactus to fall into the opposite lane blocking it and likely resulting in a crash for the losing car.It's simple enough and fun to play with for a while.
I don't know, maybe Disney can't afford to add another car&#8230;I like the shifter and cactus effect of the strip, nice touches.
The entertainment value of this one piece might wear out quickly if your child is like my 4-year-old grandson and has a short attention span which is why I titled this review, ""a good starter piece.""
The lighter one travel faster, and since the Lightning McQueen car that comes with the set is very light he usually beats out the other heavier stand-ins, but that's just the way it should be according to my kids, so it all works out.

Reviews:
I've gotten a lot of kids toys (especially those in the car & track category) that have too many bells and whistles, and inevitably some crucial feature doesn't work.
This is an exception to that rule.
The launcher works, my six year old can operate it herself, and the flag drop at the end works almost every time.
(As the first car gets to the end it hits a sensor which causes the checkered flag to come down on the winner's side, and a cactus to fall over into the other lane becoming a barrier which the losing car will run into).Now this toy does suffer from what I consider to be one of the most annoying marketing features of many kids toys in that it only comes with one car when two are clearly needed for racing.
The manufacturer clearly wants you to buy more sets.
However we discovered that most of the matchbook car sized cars we had lying around actually worked just fine.
The lighter one travel faster, and since the Lightning McQueen car that comes with the set is very light he usually beats out the other heavier stand-ins, but that's just the way it should be according to my kids, so it all works out.
So Cars and Cars 2 capitalized off their great movies with toys several years ago.
These were larger than your typical Matchbox or Hot Wheels cars, so you could never really get them to &#34;fit&#34; with their tracks and playsets.
Now Mattel is releasing playsets of the Radiator Springs town so you can play with your Cars in their own world.UNBOXING:Flo's V8 Cafe Dragstrip ships in a medium sized box from Amazon.
The product box's dimensions are: 18&#34; x 10&#34; x 2.75&#34;.
There are multiple track sections and cafe pieces that need parental help to assemble, unless your kids are good at that sort of thing.
Also included is the RS Team Lightning McQueen toy.
No tools, hardware, or batteries are required.REVIEW:So my kids have been playing with their Cars toys on their Hot Wheel sets, and they found out quickly that things don't really fit.
With this set, they now seem happier.
The set is small, and I have a feeling that Mattel has a master plan of making money on these sets, so they'll nickel and dime you to get all the other add-ons (Ramone's Body Shop and Luigi's Tire Shop) to make a full set worth playing with.
The spring mechanism in the Flo's V8 Cafe shoots two Cars down a 2.5' track.
The winner sets off a cactus on the loser's track stopping the loser Car from finishing the race.
I found that while the spring mechanism that shoots the cars works well, the cactus blocking gimmick only works sometimes.
There are also bandstand seating for 6 other Cars toys.
Can Flo's playset be played with solo?
Of course, but like I said, it's small, and my kids lost interest after about 15 minutes.OVERALL:This is a good set.
If Mattel would improve the gimmicky surprises on the track, and add a second Car to race, I'd give it 5 stars.
There is nothing special about this toy, it's cheaply made and looks it, but in fact it is low-priced and would make a nice &#34;stocking stuffer&#34; gift for a youngster.
This dragstrip does require a bit of construction.
Our kids loved it immediately.
Our 5 year old boy and 8 year old girl have played with this toy quite a bit.
Our son loves to line his cars up and then race them against each other.
It has an interesting set-up that allows you to see which car won.
There is a cactus and a flag at the end of the strip.
The flag falls on the side of the winner and the cactus falls on the side of the loser.
This is great for kids who have loved the movie Cars but also just a neat toy.
My 6 year old daughter loves this toy because she loves the Cars movie.
Its a very small track and the flag drop and cactus drop both work well.
The only down side is you need to have more cars as this only comes with one.
Luckily my daughter found some of my older son's old matchbox cars and they worked on the track.
"Flo's V8 Cafe Dragstrip playset is a good gift for a young child who likes the Cars movie and playing with cars.
It's a dragstrip -- so you put two cars into the ""stocks"" and push the button and off they go down the 1.5 foot track.
The flag goes up on the winner's side and a cactus falls down on the loser's side.
It's about 2 seconds of ""race time"" and then you put the car up and start again.
The entertainment value of this one piece might wear out quickly if your child is like my 4-year-old grandson and has a short attention span which is why I titled this review, ""a good starter piece.""
I think incorporating other aspects or features to the unit and creating a whole scene would make this an even better toy.The real complaint I have about this item is that it only comes with one car.
I get it, it is the perfect way to ensure additional profit for the company by forcing you to purchase another car, but all I care about is how diappointed my grandson was to not actually be able to ""race"" against another car.
We tried using some of the other cars we have -- namely matchbox cars -- but they don't fit into the launcher correctly so can't be propelled down the short track.The toy is made of plastic and was easy to assemble, took about 5 minutes.
Time will tell how sturdy it actually is."
My son loves all things McQueen, he loved this set at first, and was actually able to play independently with it (he's about to turn 3).
I can't believe it's a race track and only comes with one car, not much of a race.
Luckily we happened to have another McQueen laying around, but heads up if you are buying this as a gift.
My number one complaint and the reason that I had to give it 3 stars is that the black long part of the track does not stay put.
After playing with it for a few days it came apart and we were never able to get it to stay attached for very long.
I the track would have been made so that it attached to the other two pieces more securely, it would be a 5 star toy if it did.
My (just turned) 3-year old son LOVES this race set.
He has played with it for at least 20 minutes every day since I got it from Amazon Vine.
He has to work a little bit to launch the lever, but he's got the hang of it.
Older kids will have an easy time &#34;racing&#34; the cars.Assembly was pretty easy - stick stickers on, snap and click.
No batteries!Cars get &#34;loaded&#34; into Flo's V8 Cafe, then the handle is pressed and they get launched down a 2' racetrack.
A flag tips on the side of the car that hit the end first, while a cactus falls on the 2nd place car's side.
Occasionally, the cactus makes the loser car flip and fly off the track, much to my son's enjoyment.
(Probably not a goal of the design, but a reflection of the light weight of the racing cars) , There are slots in the &#34;grandstand&#34; for up to 6 other cars, and one of them &#34;rocks&#34; back and forth.Cons:* Comes with 1 car: a Lightning McQueen.
Why doesn't it come with Flo?
It's her cafe!
* You must have another car to race, since it's only packaged with one car.
Seems like it should have 2, since it is  &#34;dragstrip&#34;* The Lightning McQueen that comes with it is plastic.
Most of the other similar styles available in a set of cars or as a single purchase are metal.
The weight of the car determines (for the most part) which car wins.
So racing the plastic car that comes with the set against separately purchased cars results in the same car winning almost all the time.
* You need about 2.5 feet for the whole toy.
My kids love toy cars and the movie &#34;Cars&#34; so this is right up their alley.
Since this is a drag race setting, it would be nice if it came with two cars.
However, we have so many cars that it really wasn't an issue.
But for the price - $19.99 at the time of review - they should throw in a second one.
Aside from that, this will provide lots of fun for the little car lover(s) in your household.
Easy to assemble, well, made, mechanically well designed and works reliably (better than average).When assembling, you need to pay attention to get the spring-loaded launching hook-things on the bottom pulled out into position from their shipping configuration.Once assembled, it works like this: Pushing the handle forward into the stowed position arms the spring-loaded launching levers underneath.
You can rotate the two viewing platforms on the side until they latch in place as simply the roof on Flo's Garage.
Lifting the handle part-way starts the action by releasing the two roof sides which flip open (spring loaded) to become a three-car grand-stand on each side where you can load up your other cars to watch the race.
On one side there are little levers linked to the main handle that will lift the three cars on that side up and down as though they are cheering.
This happens when you move the handle back and forth near the launching point.
When you pull the handle back all the way it releases the pair of spring-loaded launching levers which whack the two cars you've loaded and send them shooting down the track.
The first car to reach the end causes the flag to fall in its direction and the cactus to fall into the opposite lane blocking it and likely resulting in a crash for the losing car.It's simple enough and fun to play with for a while.
Not much variety but it looks like it would integrate well with the other sets in the series and it's Cars(tm) after all so great for kids who are still into Lightning etc..Comes only with a single car (Lightning McQueen) though lots of other cars are pictured on the box so be prepared to explain why all those other cars weren't in the box.
You'll need at least one more hot-wheels / matchbox style car in order to race, and holding a competition to determine the fastest car from a collection can keep a kid busy for a while.G.
This is a simple and fun toy.
It is very easy to assemble, and kids really enjoy setting the cars off down the track.
Kids will enjoy this toy even if they don't know much about the Pixar Cars characters as this is really just about two cars racing each other down a track.
The main complaint, as many, many others have noted, is that you must buy another car in order to have a race since this playset only comes with one car.
As long as you factor that into your purchase, then nobody will be disappointed.
This unit seems to designed to get you buying more of the play-set systems, more cars, and more track.
If the child is onto the Cars movie material, they will love it.
However a drag strip with only one car is not a drag strip...therefore you need to buy more cars.
The track seems pretty short for the speed of the cars...therefore you need to add more track.
The play-set is part of the bigger story...therefore you need to buy more of the sets and connect them.
It was easy to assemble and it works well.
Children seem to enjoy it and get a lot of play out of it.
Durability is the same as any other Hot Wheels product.
The product gets abused and the cars get damaged, but heck, they can always sell you replacements.
I got this for my boys to play with as they really love playing with cars and love the Cars movie.
This is Flo's Caf&eacute; and is very easy to put together and setup.
The direction are easy to follow and you don't really have to try and figure out what is going on in them.
The action lever launches to cars down the track and a flag goes up on the winners side.
Your kids can know create their own Car stories and enact them with the help of this playset.
This is a relatively complicated little set, but it's a fun design.
Assembly took probably ten to fifteen minutes.
There are a lot of moving parts (the launcher, but also the canopies/grand stands, which flip over).
Two cars line up side by side.
You cock the mechanism by pushing the handle forward and pulling it back to the ready position and then launch the cars by pulling it one notch further back.
The cars race down the track a a pretty fast clip, and a flag at the end indicates the winner by falling one way or the other.
In all, it is a fun little set.
I'm impressed by the speed of the cars, but disappointed by the corresponding length of the track; the whole race takes maybe a second from launch to finish, and there is enough speed to easily propel the cars down a much longer track, which would make for a more enjoyable experience in my book.
The set works fine with regular Matchbox/Hot Wheels die cast cars, though they are a bit narrower and smaller than the Cars Lightning McQueen that is included with the set.
It is rather disappointing that only one car is included (it would seem Flo should come with the set too!
), so you have to supply one of your own cars before you can have a race.
But in all, a neat little set that works quite well.
The Flo's V8 Cafe Dragstip race track playset from the Disney/Pixar Cars Action Shifters sets is cool playset for a child who love the Cars movies, but the fun is limited because of the poor build quality.For starters, the lack of instructions is pretty bad (particularly for the decals/stickers).
However, after you finally build this race track you will immediately notice that it's not made of quality plastics and won't hold together if kids are aggressive when they play.What I mean by that last part is that the track pieces come apart very easily and don't snap together securely like a typical Hot Wheels track playset.Also, you can tell that the person who designed this toy was trying to cut costs anywhere possible: The included car is cheaply made plastics (like the other cars in the &#34;Cars&#34; family of toys).
Even &#34;cool&#34; features are limited, like the car racks where you can put other cars in the playset to &#34;cheer&#34; for the two racing cars ... only one side of the playset has the parts to make the other cars move, so only one side &#34;cheers&#34; for the racers.For me, the biggest problem is that the playset keeps coming apart and has to be put back together.
The only time I have to fix my son's Hot Wheels track is if he trips on it while running and pulls some of the race track apart.
This playset comes apart when your kids are just playing with it.I can really only recommend this if your kid LOVES the Cars movies.
Disney/Pixar Cars Action Shifters Flo's V8 Cafe Dragstrip Playset quickly caught the interest of my young nephew.
He even enjoyed helping assemble the set.
Assembly was fast and easy, and he was happily playing with the toy in no time at all.He was intent on playing with the set for hours, racing his cars over and over again and enjoying every minute.
The set comes with the Lightning McQueen car, but if you actually want a to be able to have a drag race, you'll need to purchase another vehicle to race with.
Having had a few toys like this for my son who loves Cars and Planes and other Disney / Pixar movies, I was half expecting something that wasn't too well done.
And about the only real complaint I can find on this one physically is the finish line, the flag / cactus assembly that you have to balance perfectly to get it to stay up, since it doesn't maintain position by any friction or detent or anything.
So if the kid bumps the track, it has a tendency to fall over to one side or another before the race is even ran.Assembly was pretty straightforward, and the moving parts seem pretty well put together.
And it really WAS fun for the first 5 or 10 minutes, but the problem with a toy like this is that the fun wears off very quickly for a kid, since it's always just the same thing.
The track is short, and there's not a lot of velocity coming out of the start, so you wouldn't get far adding more track to it to make it longer, as the cars may very well peter out by that point.The  sides of Flo's station flip upside down, and when you pull the lever, they flip over again to form &#34;stands&#34; and if you have cars in one side, wiggling the big red handle back and forth a little bit makes the cars tip slightly.Under that circular part where they launch from is a spring loaded piece that raises up, then springs down, pushing the cars to give them their speed.
It works pretty flawlessly, but again, not a lot of velocity.I've had no problems with pieces falling off or being loose like most sets like this, other than the aforementioned poorly designed finish flag and cactus.All in all it's a decent little set, but there's just not enough replay value in it for most kids.
My 4 year old loves CARS, so this playlet is just perfect.
The look/design capture the feel of the movie for sure and I like that he can race the Lightning McQueen that comes with the set.
I had to knock this down a star though because straight out of the box it only comes with one car.
Really?
You're going to sell a race set with one vehicle?
It's like selling a bicycle with one tire.
I don't know, maybe Disney can't afford to add another car&#8230;I like the shifter and cactus effect of the strip, nice touches.
My boys love the Cars movies.
I must admit, I am partial to the original Cars movie and the quirky little town of Radiator Springs.
This is a neat toy, and I especially like that you can buy other shops and points of interest in Radiator Springs to connect to Flo&#8217;s V8 Caf&eacute;.
Basically, it&#8217;s a playset and dragstrip in one with the opportunity for expansion.However, there are a couple of things I wish I would have known before selecting this toy.
First, it&#8217;s for older children.
The box states it&#8217;s for ages 4+.
I have a four-year-old and an almost two-year-old.
While I didn&#8217;t expect this toy to be appropriate for my not quite two-year-old, I also didn&#8217;t expect it to be two years before he met the designed age criteria.
Second, this playset only comes with one car.
Where&#8217;s the fun in racing ONE car?
The box indicates that the other cars pictured can be purchased separately, but the Lightening McQueen that comes with it is plastic.
It&#8217;s not like the die cast Cars vehicles my older son already owns that you can find everywhere.It&#8217;s still a neat toy.
My older son can make Lightening McQueen race along, and I foresee him enjoying reenacting scenes from Flo&#8217;s V8 Caf&eacute; for quite some time to come.
This is a decent toy.
It seems sturdy enough to last awhile.
It was easy to put together.
Kids like it.
It looks nice.
However, the car that comes with it seems a bit flimsy.
The price is not bad for what you get, but for that price it really should have come with two cars.
If it had two cars, I would have given it a five star rating instead of a four.
The coolest thing about this set is the Flo's V-8 Cafe building itself.
That's about it.You put two cars at the starting line and pull the handle to shoot them out of their starting blocks to race.
There are then two problems.
First, there is a mechanism at the other end of the track that makes a flag come down for the winner and a saguaro cactus for the loser.
Problem is, the cactus is set up to actually block the track of the losing car, making it stop dead on the track while the winning car is allowed to speed away.This might be fine, I suppose, if the track were longer.
But they give you about a foot and a half or so of track.
So the entire race lasts about 1.3 seconds (I made that number up, but it may be less for all I know.
)If you modifications to solve both of these issues, it's not bad.
First, take off the cactus.
Then both cars can go pretty far.
Kids can tell which one was faster without having the slow one physically restrained after 1.3 seconds, if they are interested.
Second, put in a longer track.
it uses standard Hot Wheels-type tracks.Even with the modifications, this is not an essential toy.
The &#34;bleachers&#34; for the spectator cars are kind of pointless too.
OK but nothing great here.
