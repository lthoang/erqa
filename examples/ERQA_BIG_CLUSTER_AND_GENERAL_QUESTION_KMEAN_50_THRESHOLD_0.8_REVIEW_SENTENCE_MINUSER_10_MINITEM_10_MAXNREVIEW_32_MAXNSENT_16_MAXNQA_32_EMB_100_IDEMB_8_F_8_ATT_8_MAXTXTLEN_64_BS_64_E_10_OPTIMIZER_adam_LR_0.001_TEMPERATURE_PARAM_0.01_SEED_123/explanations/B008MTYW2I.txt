Top sentence(s):
I was a bit disappointed with the product because after about an hour with my twin toddlers, the foam toys were chewed or torn up, and the whole contraption easily fell apart.
My grandkids aren't particulary rough with their toys but this thing falls apart so easily.
The set does require 2 AA batteries for the helicopter landing pad, but actually we haven't even added those yet.The set has two ramps - one is a spiral one and the other just a straight down ramp for launching the planes.
So my boys love anything to do with transportation, whether it be planes, trains or automobiles.
I do believe we have owned almost every single toy there is to be had.

Reviews:
So my boys love anything to do with transportation, whether it be planes, trains or automobiles.
Last year for Christmas I bought them a big car ramp, this year though I had my eye on the Big Adventures Action Fliers set from Little Tikes.
It combined the fun of airplanes and cars, literally!
Once you snap the set together, yes its pretty easy (no tools required) you are ready to play.
The set does require 2 AA batteries for the helicopter landing pad, but actually we haven't even added those yet.The set has two ramps - one is a spiral one and the other just a straight down ramp for launching the planes.
Yes you can launch planes from the top of the garbage truck!
See I told you that this set combines airplanes and cars literally.
The foam plane slides on the truck and you just launch it down.
The plane flies a good few feet too!
When you are done, there is a hanger for to place the planes until your ready to use them again.
I do wish the planes were more durable (not just foam) but then I am not sure they would fly so well.
You can though use your own cars and trucks for the ramps, which my boys quickly figured out.As far as durability goes, this definitely could be sturdier as it wobbles a bit at the top, but for the price I didn't expect too much.
With two different ramps both my boys can play and enjoy it and even at 4 and 5 years old they are loving this.Even my 16 month old wanted to play!
The toy looks better in the box.
I was a bit disappointed with the product because after about an hour with my twin toddlers, the foam toys were chewed or torn up, and the whole contraption easily fell apart.
This is not a product I would recommend to toddlers as it's durability is in question.
The kids love this toy  - the parents and grandparents not so much.
We get it all set up but the littlest bump and it falls apart and the grown ups have to put it back together.
Hoping as children get older they can put it back together themselves because they sure do enjoy the toy.
Presently we have a 5 year old and a 3 year old that are enjoying this toy as a special treat when the big kids (parents/grandparents) can play along.
My three-year old really enjoys playing with this toy & it keeps him occupied for pretty long stretches of time (i.e.
long enough to make dinner).
He uses the vehicles it came with, and also some other cars & planes he's collected that are small enough for the track.The toy was easy to assemble and seems as durable as any plastic toy (it won't be a family heirloom).
It's high and long, so takes up some space.
After various members of the family were hit with flying vehicles, we learned to make sure the slide faces a wall when being played with.
My grandkids aren't particulary rough with their toys but this thing falls apart so easily.
They found it very frustrating.I love Little Tikes and have been buying their products since my kids were small.
This is not up to their usual standards.
"This toy is very poorly made.
It constantly falls apart, and I'm 100% sure it's put together properly.
The pieces just don't ""snap"" together in any secure way...so the pieces are always coming apart.
My kids love it otherwise, I just wish they had done a better job of making it stay together better."
"First, please know that I have been raising children for 26 years.
I do believe we have owned almost every single toy there is to be had.
When you think ""Little Tikes"", you think of durable and long lasting construction.
This product, Little Tikes Big Adventures Action Fliers, does not even come close to living up to their standards or mine.
My 13 year old had this assembled in little time.
It does not take a rocket scientist to assemble it or a lot of time.
However, let's talk about flimsy construction.
If you are planning on letting a toddler play with this, don't let them lean on it because it is going over.
My toy tester is a few months shy of being 4 years old.
He loved to watch the plane take off down the ramp and that was about it as far as fun goes.
From a parents persepective, this is not worth the money or the space it takes up for what it does.
Sad to give anything Little Tikes this poor of a review, but I hate wasted money on what could have been a great toy."
