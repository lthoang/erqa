Questions:
This play set does not work, we change the batteries and still not working.
My daughters horse worked for a few moments then completely stopped.  I ve tried to sync them up and nothing is working. Am I doing something wrong?
Does the battery compartment (the button batteries) on the doll have a screwdriver closure??
Are batteries included in Barbie and the horse?
Is the horse durable?  My 8 year old wants this, but I am afraid the 3 year old sister will break it...
Can I buy the boots separate?  My granddaughter lost hers.
What type of batteries are needed and how many?
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
The horse is so creepy when it moves, it's almost funny!
Barbie had to give it a sort of heil salute, and then the creepy horse lurches into motion.
The movement is jerky, and Barbie is kind of all learning with her arm raised like that.My daughter cried.
What more can I say?
Any girl who loves Barbie would be delighted with this beautiful Barbie and horse.
Barbie controls the horse's movement.
Watch it walk, stop and bow.
Barbie's outfit is brightly colored and the horse is very pretty too.
We had to play with it on a hard surface, wouldn't work on the carpet.
The price seems a little steep.
I think it would be best for girls 4 and over.
I love the attention to detail with this Barbie.
Everything appeared well thought out.
Would make a great gift or even collector's item.
I would have liked a different color horse to make the set more realistic.
A brown horse, spotted horse or black horse would have made a nicer set in my opinion.
How many white horses with blue eyes do you see riding around?
I didn't give it a full five stars due to this because they paid so much attention to detail on the doll but missed the same execution on the horse-which I believe is just as important as the doll.
"Barbie and this Train and Ride Horse set has some unique features that are new to Barbie sets.
This horse is controlled by Barbie's arm movements.
When Barbie raises her right arm, the horse will walk forward until Barbie puts her right arm half-way down.
When Barbie puts her arm completely down, the horse does a ""bow.
""The horse also has features to keep Barbie in the saddle.
The saddle has a plastic stand coming up from it, that Barbie clips into, to keep her in place.
There are also stirrups for her boots, and handles on the reins.Barbie can control the horse from either in front of it (the ""train""), or in the saddle (the ""ride"").
The control appears to come from a ""jewel"" set in Barbie's neckline, powered by three watch-like batteries inside Barbie (included).The horse requires 4 AAA batteries, not included.Barbie has jointed legs, so she can sit in the saddle, or do tricks in the saddle (my daughters like to make her hang off the saddle in all kinds of crazy poses).Barbie comes with an English-style helmet, English-style riding jacket with a velvet collar, English-style plastic black boots, and pink painted-on jodphurs, but the horse's tack is Western-style, as is the barrel-riding advertisement on the packaging.
This is inconsistent for anyone involved with horses.
The ""bow"" is also a Western-style riding trick.
The jacket, boots, and helmet are removable.In play, the horse walks great on hard surfaces, but not on rugs.
On carpeted surfaces, the horse falls over after two steps.
Barbie does stay in the saddle very well, but she cannot stand on her own due to the articulated leg joints.My daughters are 8 and 6, and they enjoyed playing with this toy.
They use her with the new Barbie RV set."
Girls like horses!
Girls today like technology too!
So, this is an awesome Barbie toy.
The horse is motorized and responds to the position of the Barbie jockey's arms.
Any little girl would like it!
My daughter LOVES barbie so this was a treat.
She's never had an interactive toy like this one.
I was a little skeptical on the horse walking, but it does pretty well.
Horse also does tricks.
The Barbie doll itself is pretty Ok.
I thought that maybe the pants would be replaceable, but the it's plastic.
Her legs can bend so she can sit on the horse.
Anyways, fun toy.
but not sure it has the longevity fun for kids.
I selected this item from Vine.
It arrived yesterday and it is already a hit.
Both Barbie and the horse are adorable.
Barbie comes with a darling top, black boots and a helmet.
Her legs are plastic pants and she is made to bend so that she can ride/be attached to the horse.
The horse is white, with a mixture of soft and plastic hair with pink strands and pink reins and saddle.
The movements are choppy, but the horse really does move on her own.
She follows commands based on Barbie's arm placement to walk, stop or bow.
When Barbie is on the horse, the horse will also walk forward when you push her head.
The little girls playing with this are 6 and 7, and they have no trouble using her.
It is also your typical Barbie quality, so I feel like this toy will last for awhile.The only con I see is the $50 price tag.
My young daughters like Barbies and my oldest has shown an interest in horses lately.
I thought that this Barbie set was going to be a big hit, and it was.
However, the novelty of the remote didn't last more than a few days.
Don't get me wrong, my girls still play with the toy at least a few times per week, but they don't have any interest in using the remote function.
And I'm assuming the remote control is what makes this set so expensive.So far, the horse has held up well and seems pretty durable, but I'm just not completely sold on whether kids will find the limited interactivity to be fun for very long.
Also, in order for the horse to walk and do its tricks, it needs to be on a hard surface.
Households with plush carpets need not apply here, unless you want your kids playing on the kitchen or bathroom floor.
"I have a 10 year old daughter who is still a big Barbie fan.
She's an even bigger ""horse"" fan.
So when you put the two together, it's an instant classic!
There's a lot to like about this set, most of all Barbie's ability to control the horse wirelessly with hand signals.
What?!
!-Barbie controls the horse with her right arm.
The three modes are Walk-Stop-Bow.-The horse can walk by itself or with Barbie on it's back, and Barbie is secure and doesn't fall off.-The horse can bow on command.
Pretty neat.-The horse will also stop on command, or after it walks for about 10 seconds.Works great on our hardwood floors without slipping or falling over.
It will not work on carpet or even an oriental rug, because the horse's rear feet need to be able to slip along on the floor.
This toy has gotten a lot of use, and is still on the original set of 4 AAA batteries we put in.
Thankfully the set includes the watch battery sized batteries that get installed in Barbie herself.
My daughter also noted that she really likes the pretty pink riding outfit that Barbie has.Wishes we have:  The horse does not make any horse noises and sounds very motorized.
A nice neigh-ing sound would be nice to add to the repertoire.
We wish is didn't cost $50.
$39.99 would be a nice price for this.Other than that, this one is a winner!"
I have never seen a toy like this before.
Barbie actually rides a horse that really walks!
(I would have LOVED this as a kid!!)
The horse moves very well, and seems lifelike enough, and Barbie stays put too when she's riding (a huge plus!).
I love that the horse is white and also love the pink streak in the horse's mane.
Very pretty.
Barbie is beautiful as always, and wearing the right gear for a horseback ride.
All around this is adorable and would be a very cool & delightful surprise for a young girl as a gift!
Very highly recommended!
:)
"This RC barbie horse is not perfect.
But its pretty darn good.There are two main concerns with it:1) It walks nicely on hardwood floors, has some problems with slick tile, and really won't walk on carpet or rugs.
So, you can't use the RC function ""anywhere"".2) When it falls asleep to save batteries, you have to hold down a button on the horse's head to wake it up.
This wasn't obvious to my daughter who doesn't read instructions.3) You need 4 AAA batteries (not included).
Barbie's batteries (coin cell) are included.Overall its pretty fun.
My daughter really enjoys it, which is the main concern.
The horse kinda walks clumsily along but my daughter thinks its great.When Barbie is on the horse you press the button on the front to make it work.
But, if Barbie is on the horse's back, the infrared signal can bounce off a wall in front of the toy and work well also.The horse walks forward a few feet and then stops automatically.
Which is good because you don't want to come into the room and find it wasting batteries walking around.Overall I think its really a cool little toy.
I think it will have average durability for a toy of this type... meaning... not really durable.My personal opinion is that the RC function has limited play value and is kind of ""gimmicky"".
But kids like gimmicks, and my daughter is happy."
I'm always a little hesitant about dolls and toys that have extra joints for mobility.
In the Barbie line, in particular, added articulation usually doesn't add much to playability but seriously detracts from product appearance.
I was quite pleasantly surprised, however, at how the articulated joints in this Barbie are fairly seamless.
That is, you can see them, but because the clothes are built onto the doll, it doesn't look bad.
The horse's articulated joints are just shy of ugly, but worth having in exchange for the walking feature.Just out of the box, I feared we had a dud.
I looked at the box and quickly determined that batteries were included in the package, so we thought we could get right to playing.
I was about ready to determine that our horse was a dud when I re-read the box and realized that the doll's batteries are included, but you will need to have 4 AAA batteries to take advantage of the horse and Barbie's remote features.
Fortunately, we buy batteries in bulk.
Once we got our batteries in place, my daughter and I really enjoyed the action features of Barbie and her horse.I was prepared for some wobbliness and having to re-seat Barbie several times when we started.
But Barbie has not fallen off her horse once since we've opened the box.
Likewise, we haven't had to do anything at all to stabilize the horse.
It's designed so that it bows, walks, and stands quite easily.
The horse responds quickly and accurately to the signals that my daughter sends by raising, lowering, or straightening Barbie's arm.And on top of this being just a really great Barbie playset, the packaging was incredibly (by Mattel standards) easy to open!
All said, this is one of the better Barbie dolls we've acquired in quite some time.
I'm a doll collector have been my whole life.
Just recently have added the newer Barbies and I was sure this was not going to work as the box says it will.
I was wrong.
Concerning the box it will take about 5 minutes to get the doll and horse out and you have to be really careful on the dolls head clipping the plastic as you could cut the hair.Barbie can command the horse to bow, stop and walk.
When riding she rides 10 steps and you press the horses hair in the front and the horse bows with Barbie on it.
Now it does have a mechanical sound like all the walking toys but it is still fun.
I have to admit at least once a day I make the horse walk and laugh...best medicine.
I am sure this will delight any Barbie collector from 3 to 93.
The horse has a nice mane that you can comb you have to gently pull off a sewn on plastic anchor.
The dolls legs are not so pretty because of how they have to bend.
I like the Skipper and Scooter dolls I had as a child that had natural looking soft legs that bent but made clicking sounds.
The Horse will not tolerate being thrown around so keep that in mind it says ages 3 and up I'd say more like 4-5 yr olds myself.Really cute and fun set.
I was dismayed to see that this Barbie uses button batteries and is recommended for children 3 and over.
I'm sure most readers of this review know that button batteries, when ingested by a child, can seriously injure or kill the child.
I think 3 is too young for this toy for that reason.
Button batteries need to be eliminated in toys for young children!Some pros:- Battery-saving sleep feature- Very cuteSome cons:- This Barbie has legs designed to be in a saddle and her jodhpurs are painted on.
So you can't take this Barbie and dress her up in outfits from your other Barbies.- Button batteries, as previously mentioned.- Toy needs to be on a flat floor, like a wooden floor, to work properlyIf you have an older child who loves Barbie, this will be a fun, different toy.
We were lucky enough to pick this up for my niece (6) in conjunction with the Barbie RV.
While that combo is a bit pricey (and I wouldn't recommend buying both because that'd be cost-prohibitive), if you have the means, it's a great 1-2 combo.It's nice to see some Barbie accessories that aren't mansions, fancy cars, RVs, and other items that in the real world out completely out of 99% of the people's price range.
Not that a horse is in everyone's budget, but access to horses (either family, friends, or riding lessons) is at least a bit more probably.The remote function is a nice touch, but as others have mentioned, the novelty quickly wears off.
It seems to me that most kids don't necessarily care for fancy electronics when it comes to toys like that.
They tend to enjoy bright colors and functionality more, which is fine with me since that tends to spur greater imagination.
In that respect, this Barbie set is perfectly fine, but you'd can probably find a less expensive, yet comparable, set.
I noticed it works great at my house but I have all wood floors if it gets on a carpet it won't work but for the most part really great toy I love how the Barbie stays on the horse and the horse knows when she is on to walk.
Also a great feature is the auto sleep button I will not be going thru very many batteries like most of the toys :)
This new Barbie Train and Ride Horse Playset will be a hit with any fan of Barbie.
This special edition Barbie that is included in the playset is able to interact with the horse - by adjusting Barbie's arms while she is in front of the horse you can get the horse to walk, stop, and even take a bow.
A special plastic harness piece helps hold Barbie on the horse so her adventure can continue.Barbie's outfit includes a riding helmet, jacket and boots that are removable, and special 'painted on' pants that are not removable.
This Barbie has uniquely jointed legs that help her sit astride the horse and stay on it.The horse has a charming pink saddle and bridle, and a brushable mane.
The forelock is actually a button that you can push to get the horse to walk without using Barbie's arms to signal.
After not being used for a while the horse does go into a 'sleep' mode, simply pressing the forelock 'button' turns it back on.
The horse's motion is a bit choppy and awkward and works best on a hard surface - it does not work well on carpet.The playset requires 4 AAA batteries for the horse (not included), and 3 button-cell batteries for Barbie (included).
While the recommended age is 3 and up, I really don't see a 3 or even 4 year old being able to use the primary features of this toy on their own without some assistance.
My 5-year old needed some instruction and help in using this the first few times - how to move Barbie's arms the right way, and how to clip the special harness onto Barbie so she doesn't fall off the horse.The price is a bit steep, but considering you're getting both a Barbie and a horse - for some it may be worth it.
It would have been nice if they had maybe thrown in a few small accessories - my daughter has improvised by stealing a brush and food accessories from other Barbie sets she had to use with the horse from this set.Overall a very cute set - it's a great way to get the imagination going and encourages lots of play time.
"We received this for our 6 year old daughter who adores Barbie.
While we can label this product ""good,"" it is difficult to review in comparison to the price spikes we have seen.First off, build quality is just OK. At a price point of more that $50, I was expecting more.
I simply do not anticipate this product lasting more than 6 months with normal use by a 6 year old (I will update review).
The design is just OK as well.
For example, a 6 year old might have a little difficulty attaching Barbie to the horse using the retainer that holds the doll in place.
Also, if the retainer, made of plastic, should break,the doll will not stay on the horse, rendering the toy mostly useless (though not entirely).
The horse works best on hardwood or smooth tile floors and is prone to falling over, especially on carpeting (even short berber type).
The toy uses a combination of batteries including 4 AAA for the horse (not included) and 3 watch type batteries (included) that did not have a model number but are definitely not the more common type.The product itself works.
Press the button and it walks.
Press again it bows.
Press again it walks, etc.....
The wireless aspect of the product actually works well, even at a distance.
If you take the doll off the horse, you can use her right arm to get the horse to walk.
It worked without any issues.So, whether the toy is right for you will likely come down to price.
I understand incorporating pricing remarks into a review can be ""controversial"" so therefore, I will not.
You make the call."
"I was skeptical that this horse could keep its balance, but it really works.
A transmitter inside Barbie (I think it works through the molded-on necklace) controls the horse and makes it bow, walk or ""whoa"" by moving her arm.
The horse takes 4 AAA batteries, which is fine, but Barbie herself requires several button batteries, and they died after a few weeks of play.
So keep in mind that some button batteries will have to be added to your battery stockpile."
My daughter has had a Barbie horse before and it did not work very well, which is why I was very skeptical about this horse, but we decided to give her a try.
I've very glad that we did!PROS:- The horse actually walks!!
Unlike the previous horse we had, this horse actually walks beautifully!
It walks perfectly on the wood or linoleum floor, and it does walk on carpet, but nowhere near as well as when it's on a flat service.- Controlling the horse!
Controlling the horse is extremely cool as Barbie does it all!
Raise her hand all the way up to make the horse walk.
Put the hand straight out and the horse will stop.
Put her hand all the way down and the horse bows!
And here's the really cool part - it doesn't matter if Barbie is in front of the horse (as she is in most pics), or RIDING the horse - as long as she's in close proximity the horse obeys her!- The Barbie is very pretty and has nice hair.
The hat that comes with the Barbie is a nice little touch!- The bridle comes off!
With a little bit of work you can take the horse's bridal off, which makes her that more realistic.- Barbie stays on!
Due to the clip that goes around Barbie's waist, she stays on her horse even when she bows!CONS:- The horse's tail really bothered my daughter as it is plastic.
The mane is a very soft, regular hair (although the front part of the mane is plastic, I'm assuming that it has something to do with controlling the horse), but the tail is completely plastic.
Why didn't they make the tail out of the same hair the mane is made out of?- Barbie's pants can not be removed.
The jacket/top piece can come off, as can the boots, but the pink pants stay on permanently.VERDICT:Overall the Barbie and Her Sisters in a Pony Train and Ride Horse Playset is a great set.
The horse works absolutely beautifully and the Barbie is, of course, stunning.
This is a fantastic toy or collectible for a young horse lover.
I wouldn't recommend this for a very young Barbie lover, mabye age 8-10 would be best.
It has some unique and really fantastic features for the horse.
She can really ride it, train it and interact with it.
Great toy and a pretty good price for this level of interaction.
Barbie and Her Sisters in A Pony Tale  Train and Ride Horse Playset is adorable and fun, however there is one key thing missing.
Barbie is pantless.
Her legs are painted pink, pants are literally painted onto her.
It's awkward.
Other than that this is a great toy.
Barbie is as pretty as ever and she rides her horse in elegant (pantless) style.
Barbie acts as a remote and by changing her position the horse does what she's instructed it to do.
A little plastic piece sits on the horse's back to hold Barbie in place (not sure how long this will last in play before breaking off) while she rides.
The horse really walks!
Much more fun than when I was a kid and had a horse that's legs didn't even bend.
And I'm pretty sure that the horse has the same eyes as Barbie.
Loads of fun for little girls this holiday season!
I have a horse-loving six year old, and she hasn't stopped playing with this.
The pony moves at the doll's command (lift arm = move forward, for example), and to my daughter's delight, it even works when Barbie is riding her white steed.
Love it!
My daughter was elated to receive this Barbie horse (and another Barbie with it).
The horse is pretty (except perhaps the hard plastic tail) and the Barbie that comes with it is wearing a really cute riding outfit (except the pants don't come off).
The best part about this toy though is that the horse walks really well, doesn't fall over and Barbie (and actually Skipper and Chelsea who we had around the house) doesn't fall off!The Barbie hand motions to control the horse?
Well, my daughter isn't really interested in that.
She wants Barbie ON the horse.
It does work, though.I will say, I find the price to be a bit steep, but it's nice that the horse walks to well and comes with a lovely Barbie.
I just wish Barbie had pants that would come off/on.
Isn't undressing/dressing her half the fun of Barbie?
"As a longtime Barbie collector, I've noticed Mattel is now making Barbie more ""action oriented"" and her sets are more ""gimmicky"".
For example, there was the digital camera photo fashion Barbie, with the camera installed inside Barbie's torso.This Barbie, like others in similarly made ""action"" sets, is not meant to be displayed separately from the set in which she appears, which is a shame.
In other words, you can't remove her from the set and dress her like a regular doll.
Though you can remove her jacket, helmet and boots, her legs aren't normal Barbie legs - they're fully jointed and hot pink in color, as her jodhpurs are literally painted on her.
The necklace she wears is also permanent, as it's set in her neck.For me, the best part of this set is how you can control the horse's movements by using Barbie: raise and lower her arm, and the horse moves according to the implied command - it can walk, stop or bow.
Very cute, and the wireless function allows you to do so at a distance.
When Barbie rides the horse, the animal will move choppily forward after you gently press a spot on her head.
I think a child of 6-10 will enjoy playing with this.
Moreover, the horse goes into a ""sleep"" mode when it hasn't been used for awhile, which is nice since it preserves battery power.However, the weak points for me are the (a) limited usefulness of the doll apart from the set (b) the high price and (c) the overall cheap quality of the plastic, which is drenched in pink and red.
I think $50 is a lot for what is basically a doll and a motion-operated horse, which doesn't even come with batteries.Also, Mattel keeps drenching all their contemporary Barbies in shades of pink, mauve and red.
I own a Barbie with a much more realistic riding outfit (red jacket, white jodhpurs, and black helmut) and wish Mattel would stop using the same colors over and over - it must be cheaper to do so.While I believe this set will be entertaining for the little ones, once the wireless function breaks down and the horse can no longer move, it will be of little use for display, since it's not as aesthetically pleasing as other Barbie sets I've seen.
But then I'm biased toward the older models - for little children, the novelty of using Barbie to make a horse move will definitely attract them."
