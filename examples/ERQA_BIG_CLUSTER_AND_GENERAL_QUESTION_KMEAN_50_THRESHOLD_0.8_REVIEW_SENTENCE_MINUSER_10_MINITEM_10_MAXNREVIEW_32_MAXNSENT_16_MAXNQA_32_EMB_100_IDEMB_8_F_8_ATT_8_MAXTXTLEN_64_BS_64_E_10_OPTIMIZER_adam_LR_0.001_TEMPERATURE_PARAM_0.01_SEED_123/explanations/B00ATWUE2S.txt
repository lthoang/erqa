Top sentence(s):
Not a very friendly response and very disappointing.
This games teaches your kids some strategical gameplay.
The set-up is simple, the clean-up is simple but the game time is fun.
In such cases, and assuming both players correctly build their paths, our solution is to have a playoff between those players.
It was a blast but we lost one of the colored squares and that was the end of the fun.

Reviews:
Critical thinking games often do not need to be played exactly according to the rules.
Different children will respond to them differently.
Many of the rules are created for children naturally inclined toward critical thinking.
So, other children might need some variation.Such is the situation with this iTrax game.
I love the intention: find a path and recreate it in 3D form.
It really is a good exercise for children.
The cards are filled with lines and squares.
Cubes and three different lengths of rods accompany the cards.
Children view a card and then race to recreate the path with their cubes and rods, making sure to match the colors and lengths correctly.
Whoever creates the path correctly first wins the card.Pros:- The colors on the cards and the rods match pretty well.
This is important for the visual aspect of this game.- Although the rules call for a race, this can easily be used in a variety of ways.
Children can play independently, work together to create the path, or compete.Cons:- There are too few paths in the middle level.
The easy and hard levels have more options.- The cards are two-sided.
Because players win the card when they complete a path first, the other side of that card cannot be used in the same game.Bottom line: My kids love it!
And I love any game that truly exercises their brains.
"This game is pretty straightforward to learn, but challenging to play.
Each of up to four players gets two cubes and nine square sticks of varying lengths, each with different colors on each side.
There are a series of cards with progressive levels of ""Ace"", ""Whiz"" and ""Brainiac"" showing a pattern of blocks and sticks.
On each card there is one and only one path that starts and ends with a cube.
It is your challenge to be the first to find that path and recreate it with your own sticks and cubes.
The first player to call out ""iTrax"" and have the correct arrangement gets to keep the card, and the first player to accumulate seven cards wins the game.I expected to like this game better than I ended up liking it.
I initially played it with my six-year-old daughter, but the difference in our ability levels hampered our enjoyment.
She had difficulty even with the ""Ace"" level, whereas I found that level easy and rather boring.
We tried using different cards - me using a ""Whiz"" card and her using an ""Ace"" card, but that didn't seem to enhance our enjoyment.I then played against my parents.
(I come from a competitive family and grew up playing card and board games).
That was more fun with equal level players, but this still isn't a game I rate among my favorites.
It's a very picky game because you have to get the pieces aligned and joined exactly right and the different lengths and some of the colors can be difficult to discern from each other.
After about 10 minutes of playing, I found myself getting a headache.This is probably a great game for the right players.
I imagine competitive-natured older children and teens of equal abilities would enjoy the head-to-head challenge.
Also, this could be a good tool to help kids with special needs develop visual-spatial skills if they play it alone or non-competitively with a teacher or parent.
The game does not, however, work well with mixed ability groups, and older adults may find their eyes giving out after a short period."
It's nice to find a game the whole family can enjoy together, even with a wide range of ages.
Since you can sort the cards into various complexities, it's easy to ensure that there's something suitable for both young and old.
It's easy to play and customizable.
While I don't think this will be one of our family favorites over time, I can see it being pulled out when younger family members or friends visit.
The game involves searching for and recognizing a particular pattern/arrangement in a particular card, and rebuild it using pieces in your hand.
The game comes with 50 cards each with colorful, maze-like arrangements printed on them.
You use a different card for each round.
As soon as the card is revealed, you have to search and find the arrangement where the lines connect two different squares.
You then use the little wooden pieces you have and rebuild that pattern - the first to win seven rounds wins.The game is for 4 players, very easy to set-up and start playing.
Each player gets 3 each of long, medium and short poles and 2 cubes to build the pattern (we used 4 ziplock bags to store them in the same manner; that way we didn't have to sort through to split them amongst the players every time we play).
The image cards are of good size so that the four players can look for patterns with out blocking each others views - just make sure you are playing on a smaller table or a regular-sized cards table where all players are equally located from the card.As always, older players/kids are quick in recognizing the required patterns.
Some players might tend to copy others that have found a pattern.
Some players deliberately build a slightly wrong pattern and then correct it to overcome this.
Our game testers--adults and game-playing kids ages 7,9, and 12--really liked the game.
We like to shuffle all three levels of cards together and take them as they come.
In addition, the kids usually like to just go through the whole stack of cards rather than stopping when one player has seven cards.Pro:nice quick game after a night of longer playchallenging for spatial and color relationshipsquite a few different playsCon:if the light in the room isn't very bright, the colors can sometimes be a little hard to distinguishat some point, we may start to &#34;get&#34; the mazes a little too quickly, but the kids are starting to try making their own mazes on graph paper with appropriately colored pencilsNow here is the major problem we had with our game: when we received it, there was one long rod missing.
Without that piece, only three people can play, and we often have four people who want to play.
When I went to the company's website, it took a little doing to find a customer service contact.
When I did get an email address, it took several days for a response, and that was that they do not stock any spare parts.
I should just take the game back to where I bought it for a refund/replacement.
Not a very friendly response and very disappointing.
Since Amazon didn't have any more sets for those of us reviewing it, we now have a game that only three can play.
We are managing, but this has made me hesitant to buy any more Learning Resources products.
This game is best played with a very competitive youngster - it makes it all that much fun.
You have 25 double sided cards that range from EASY to killer hard (some I could barely find where the cubes connected - very hard).
And then there are 36 rods - TIP - get out two small plastic zip loc bags - it will make playing for next time easier if you sort BEFORE you put the game away.
Next you have 8 cubes.
The objective - rebuild with your rods the design that links the two cubes together.
Simple at first and then a race for your life.Why is this game great?
Developmentally this game is challenging for little fingers, for pattern finding, for replicating patterns, for color identification.
You will know if your child has ANY brain issues within 5 minutes of sitting down to play with them.
Which is great to find out young, because there are so many incredible interventions.
This game is a great early diagnostic tool!
I am so sure it was not intended as that - but really, it is ;-)Fast paced - especially if you have a competitive child!
!One last tip - you need a big table - old people like me should definitely be seated at a table.
It is too hard to play on the floor, although the kids will do exactly that.Be sure you have ALL the pieces before putting the game away - another reason you will be happy to get those two extra zip loc baggies out!
"I am pleased to recommend this new critical thinking game from Learning Resources which teaches spatial thinking and pattern recognition.
The object is to replicate diagrams using supplied cubes and rods of specific colors and shapes.
This is fun for the whole family, and older kids have more than enough chance to beat the adults.
If you are color blind, don't bother.With twenty-five two-sided game cards of varying difficulties, the game offers fifty permutations.
You can also rotate the cards so that the orientation is unfamiliar.
This prevents memorization of the patterns and extends playability of the game.iTrax is fun but the Instructions fail to address several scenarios.
There's no mention of ties, which seem to occur frequently.
In such cases, and assuming both players correctly build their paths, our solution is to have a playoff between those players.
The Instructions also state that the first player to collect seven cards wins.
However, the more players (up to four), the less likely that anyone will collect seven cards.
In fact, one level (Moderate) only has six cards!
In our opinion, the ""How to Win"" instructions should be revised as follows: ""The winner is the first player to collect seven cards or the player with the most cards when the round is completed.""
We might also suggest a privacy shield.
Why?
The biggest challenge of the more difficult levels is simply recognizing what the path actually is.
Sometimes a player will be stumped before building.
This games teaches your kids some strategical gameplay.
The players start by flipping over a card to view a pattern and then they need to find the pieces to reproduce the pattern ... racing against other players.
The game pieces themselves seem very sturdy.
If you think of this and introduce it to kids as a cross between a game and a project, then you and the kids won't be disappointed.
The &#34;game&#34; aspect comes solely from the fact you are racing against the other players to recreate your board.
Be aware that this is a &#34;solitary&#34; or individual play game in that each player is doing his or her own thing rather than interacting (similar to Bananagrams).
If you're worried this game may be too hard for your child, try &#34;Make n Break&#34; first.
It has cards and blocks, but it is a little less complex and more 3D.
I see this as a more advanced version, but my 6 year old still prefers &#34;Make n Break.&#34;  I think he will eventually switch over to this game in a couple of years when building blocks lose their allure.
The pieces are smaller and the designs more intricate.
"I love these multi-player, multi-level games.
Players of different ages/abilities can play together, choosing from 3 levels of challenges that level the playing field.
My 6-year-old used the simpler ""Ace"" cards, my 9-year-old used the ""Whiz"" cards, while my husband and I tackled the difficult ""Braniac"" cards.iTrax challenges players to recreate a maze-like pattern with a set of blocks.
Game play requires attention to detail and patterns which is good for developing critical thinking.
Plus it's fun and competitive and doesn't require much rule-reading to get started.
You can teach the game to a new player in just a minute or two.Our only complaint is that there aren't enough cards, even with the existing cards being 2-sided.
Part of the challenge is finding the correct pattern to copy on the card and after many rounds of play, you begin to memorize the cards.
There are also only enough pieces for 4 players to play, no extras in case any are lost."
This is a great game that combines mazes and critical thinking.
My 6 year old loves figuring out how to beat it faster.
Even my 2 year old enjoys trying to play.
It's a great game for elementary aged kids through adults when you want a little more challenge.
My children all enjoyed playing this game...and could all play together from 4 years up.
The older children were not necessarily faster at it than the younger ones either which was great since most games the younger ones can play, but always lose if it is speed based.
I appreciated that these need to  be completed exactly...that is great for mathematical development as there is only ONE correct answer.
I also noticed that perceptual skills improved as my children played this.
It is a game worth having and does work on the skills sets it states it will.
"A puzzle, a maze, a test for the problem solving skills of young and old alike.
iTrax is for ages 6 to Adult.
A puzzle card is turned over and players must observe two blocks that connect in a path using various color segments.
The challenge is to duplicate the pattern on the table and be ""first!
""The set comes with 50 8"" x 8"" patterns, 8 multi-colored cubes and 36 mulit-colored rods of various lengths.
The set-up is simple, the clean-up is simple but the game time is fun.
There are 3 levels of difficulty clearly marked on the pattern cards.LR Learning Resources  claims ""Replicating the patterns shown on the iTrax Critical Thinking Game cards is a great way to develop kids' critical thinking and problem solving skills, both crucial to academic success.
Additionally, matching the blocks to those in the pictures enhances observation and attention to detail.
And, as with all games, game play nurtures a sense of perseverance, fair play, and good sportsmanship.
""I think iTrax will become a family favorite."
I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game.
2 or more players play together and race to see who can create the pattern first.
You first have to locate the two square blocks that connect to each other and then you have to recreate the pattern on the table in front of you.
When you completed the puzzle you yell iTrax and everyone stops and the pattern is verified.
The first person to collect 7 cards is the winner.There are three levels.
My 8 year old started with level one and really enjoyed it.
Perfect for her as she has eye tracking problems so this game is perfect for that eye hand coordination and following a pattern.
Very fun game and is very helpful for kids critical thinking.
I bought this and Mental Blox Critical Thinking Game by Learning Resources [Toys & Games] for my granddaughter who is almost 6 years old.
She was so frustrated by the other game that we didn't even try this game.
At least, we didn't actually try to play the game.
Instead, we took out the cards and simply explored.The premise of the game is simple--each player looks at a card, finds what part of each design needs to be recreated, and, using multi-colored sticks, be the first to create the path.
Simple enough to learn and master.
We never played it as a competitive game, however, just as a pattern recognition challenge.
It was fun for a little while but she didn't get want to play with it for very long.
We've set it aside, for now, with the expectation to give it another try during the holiday break from school.
This game is great for helping kids develop critical thinking skills needed for problem solving.
The good part is it doesn't feel educational.
iTrax is great for all ages because no reading is required and there are several levels.
The game appears deceptively easy, but once you start you realize how much you have to focus and interpret how pieces should be laid according to your perspective.
One of the problems I see is if you lose a pieces it makes it difficult to play with a number of players.
If it's only two or three players all the time (as it is in our house) the other pieces can act as extras.
There used to be a game called Rubric's Race that worked in much the same way.
It was a blast but we lost one of the colored squares and that was the end of the fun.
