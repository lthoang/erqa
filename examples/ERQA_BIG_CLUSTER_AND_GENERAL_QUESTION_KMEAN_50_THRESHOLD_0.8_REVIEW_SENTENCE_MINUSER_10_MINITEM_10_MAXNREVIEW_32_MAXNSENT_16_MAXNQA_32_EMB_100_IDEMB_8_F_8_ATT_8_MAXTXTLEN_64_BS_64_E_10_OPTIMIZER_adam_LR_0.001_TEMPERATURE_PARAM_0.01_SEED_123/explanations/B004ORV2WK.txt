Reviews:
"Being a Fisher Price home, I knew my daughter would LOVE this toy!
I saw the commercials when I received the product about a month ago and was so excited to try it out.My daughter is now 1 and has been playing with this for about a month.
First, when you get the toy, be careful removing it from the box.
It has the hard plastic ties that are so tight and hard to get a good angle at; I feared I might cut myself or the toy removing it.
Once I removed it, I wiped it down with a toxic free disinfectant wipe.
The toy is open and exposed so I did not know how many hands had touched it from the factory, to warehouse, to shipping.
You cannot remove the outfit on the dog so going over it lightly with the wipe I felt better since at my daughter's age, everything ends up in her mouth.
Also inspect the toy for loose threads and fabric.
On the back on the head the sewing is poorly done, almost in a zig zag and there is a lot of loose fuzz, like you would find inside a pillow.
I removed it but there is still some sticking out and I did not want her grabbing it to choke on it.
The outfit has a few loose threads, I just trimmed them.Now to the toy, my daughter LOVES it.
I let her play with it in her playpen or sitting on the floor.
The toy is VERY sturdy, even on uneven surfaces.
In the playpen it has not fallen over and on the floor it stays upright.
When I saw the toy I thought the feet and hands were areas to press to get the dog to sing and dance, it is only the two feet.
My daughter does have a hard time recognizing the feet are the only place you can activate the toy since the hands have bigger areas to push.
"My son loves stuffed animals, dogs, and any toy that makes noise.
We received the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Dance and Play Puppy from Amazon Vine when he was about 11 months old.
Back then, he was mildly interested it in and when it clapped, he did too, and it made him laugh.
I was never super fond of the toy, as you have to keep pushing the button in its foot to keep it playing - for an awkward toddler, the dog is likely to fall over.
The feet don't have sufficient width to keep an unsteady hand from knocking it down.
Now, if it does fall down, it is cute in saying ""Oopsy!""
and laughing.
However, it interrupts whatever activity the dog was doing at the time.
You have to right it and then push the button again.
Also, having one ear labeled ""up"" and one labeled ""down"" is not helpful in learning actual ""up and down"".
If the underside of the ear had been labeled down, that would have made more sense.
In addition, the motorized actions are LOUD.Fast forward to 14 months.
My son, who is afraid of nothing, starts to take an active dislike to the toy.
He knocks it down and runs out of the room whenever I try to get him to play with it.
I think it's mostly over the very loud noises it makes while moving.
He's now 21 months and still feels the same way - he says ""No puppy please"" and if I try to keep playing with it, he'll start to cry.So overall, there are better toys, with more educational components."
My kids loved their Laugh and Learn puppies when they were toddlers.
They took them everywhere, even to bed.
When I saw the Dance and Play puppy, I had to get it for my neice, who just turned one.
Just like the original, this puppy is a lot of fun for babies, and has a nice learning mode with letters and numbers.
The clapping and dancing is by far the most popular activity so far, and while the music is a little loud, the songs are not annoying as some children's toys can get after the fiftieth repetition.
The puppy also blows kisses, which is very cute.
The button sizes seem perfect for a one year old, and there are just enough buttons to be entertaining without overwhelming my neice.
The puppy is much bigger than I was expecting, at about 15 inches tall.Overall, I'm very pleased with this toy and will be getting another for a family friend.
It's educational, fun, and after three months of hard play is still holding up quite nicely.
My only negative comment is that it takes six AA batteries, and with a lot of play throughout the day, these last only about two weeks.
"Thankfully this is a cute toy because my 2-year-old does NOT leave it alone.
Since the day it came, the little puppy has been singing itself away all day & night.
That being said.
.
.
the batteries haven't run out yet.As far as this being a ""learning toy,"" it's not spectacular.
It does have some learning songs and the like, but it's not going to do a whole lot.However, the laughing, dancing, and playing are all perfectly adequate.
My daughter LOVES to dance & play with it all day.My one gripe with the toy is that the gears on the inside when it moves are LOUD, sometimes louder than the dog's singing.
That should be looked into."
I grew up in Southern California.
Went to Disneyland a lot.
LOVED Bear Country Jamboree as a kid.
Wow what I would have given for my own animatronic bear or puppy.
At first our 13 month old daughter did not share my excitement at trying this out.
In fact she Hated it.
Hated it.
Every time it moved she broke down in tears.So we put it aside.
Left it in off mode around her other toys.
I didn't want to write a review at that point.
I wanted to wait and see if anything would change.
Well unlike a lot of other toys this one, even in off mode, retained interest for her.
And she would go up sometimes and kiss it.
Which she does not do with other toys at all.
So she knew it was 'different'.
When she did kiss it we would turn it on.
"One of my kids immediately liked this play puppy and even started sleeping with it.
This doll makes that kind of deep connection probably because of the cute way it moves.
I don't like the way it feels to be perfectly honest.
You can feel the hard plastic right under the ""skin.""
It's not soft and cuddly.If this doll were soft and cuddly, it probably couldn't stand up and dance as it does.
This experience showed me that I have no predictive ability for toys.
I cannot tell when a toy will be popular with my kids in advance, and whatever I don't like about a toy doesn't seem to matter to them."
I'm impressed with the movement ability of this little guy.
The ears raise, hands move, and hips waggle, and everything is coordinated pretty well.
It captures my child's attention and keeps her entertained for a short period of time.
The 2 buttons on the feet are easy to push for little kids and it cycles through quite a few different songs.
Overall, a pretty good little toy.
My daughter is 13 months old, and she loves playing with this Fisher-Price puppy.
The toy has two buttons, one on each foot.
The buttons are easy to push and are colorful, so it didn't take long for my daughter to learn how to push them herself.
When the buttons are pushed, the puppy claps and sings, and his ears go up and down.
This entertains my daughter for about 5 minutes, and it's nice that she can push the buttons on her own.
On the downside, there are only two buttons, so the toy gets boring pretty quickly.
Also, the puppy is meant to stand on the ground and isn't very soft or cuddly.All in all, my daughter prefers her Scout puppy, which is more soft and cuddly like a traditional stuffed animal.
The Scout puppy is also programmable with her name and favorite color, food, etc., so it's more interesting for a longer period of time.
It's also less pricey.
"My 3 year old neice and her 8 month year old brother are both nuts about this toy!
Granted, the 3 year old can do more with it and is able to manipulate it better than her baby brother, but he giggles and laughs and imitates his sister and plays along with the ""commands"" from the doggie.Who can say whether it will really prove to ultimately be educational - but it does have that built in as a feature of the play, so it is directed in that manner.
It's not as if it is a ball or toy soldiers or Barbie which all have their allure, but no built-in educational value.This is a good toy for the little kids and I love watching them drag it around, knowing I ""done good."""
My 11 month looks at this puppy like it is a real person.
In fact, she tries to treat it like a real person.
Unforntunately, the puppy is not ready for my daughter.
The makers of this toy obviously forget that children under 2 do not understand toys can break.
So my daughter is only able to play with this toy with supervision.
The first time she pulls the puppy by the movable ears, they will break.The puppy does teach rhyming, opposites, songs, as well as proper behavior for young children.
For a young audience, it can be entertaining and educational.
I only question the durability.
The Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Dance and Play Puppy stands easily on his own.
Even on carpet.
My daughter thinks he's lots of fun.
I've seen her dancing with him.My daughter also has the original Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Learning Puppy.
The puppies look very much alike but I prefer this new one.
You can hear his gears when he moves, but the same is the case for my daughter's Elmo doll.
And he's not as cuddly as the original puppy, but then he works better.
He only has two buttons on his feet to press while the original has buttons to press on his hands, ears and feet.
My original puppy had many issues.
The most annoying of which was that if you ever moved him, he would immediately stop what he was doing and move on to something else.
I've never heard him sing the complete alphabet.
He would also creep me out by talking suddenly long after my daughter had put him down.
This newer puppy seems to have integrated activity with learning and is more stable.
I got this when my son was about 3 months old.
He is now almost 5 months.
From the first time we pushed the button on the puppy's foot, my son has been intrigued.
He loves to just watch him dance and sing.
My son cannot interact too much with the puppy just yet, but he does get upset when it stops singing and wants more.
He keeps trying to figure out how to get him to go more, but so far hasn't figured out to push on his foot.I imagine that this toy is going to get a lot of use in the next few months and longer.
The bright colors interest my son and keep him looking and checking out the puppy.
The songs are short and just enough to keep his attention.It is a little hard and not as soft as I would like, but I don't think that would work well with the motorized toy.
The motor is also quite loud.
I can imagine that the loud motor and sounds (which need to be louder to be heard over the motor) might startle a small child.
So far this has not been an issue with my son who is easily startled (he sometimes cries when I talk too loudly to him).Overall, I recommend this toy.
I think the recommended age is 9+ months, but it works for younger children as well, but will be more useful as he gets older.
This is a wonderful toy for a toddler!
It is very large, as well made as one could expect at this price point and in this age of cruddy quality in general.
Right off the bat you need to READ the instructions that tell you to turn the product ON (it came in demo mode and if left in that mode you are going to think the toy is defective).
We also immediately turned the volume down as this is a very enthusiastic little puppy!This is a very endearing, engaging little dog and it definitely feels like he is interacting with your child.
He has a very inviting face and he plays games and sings songs and teaches practical things like ABCs and counting.
This is a toy to actually hold your child's interest for more than two minutes!
I think it is a great value compared to the many other toys out there that are in this price.
"This little guy is cute, don't get me wrong.
And he's pretty interactive and brightly colors are really appealing.
He has a cute, sweet face, and his ears are as delightful in person as in the picture.
He's kind of fun, and my two year old nephew likes ""things that make noises"" so it's a good buy.
All in all, I can't 100% love this little guy, but it's not his fault.
There's something about this whole genre of toys (the ones that have stiffer inner parts and are about their mechanics not cuddling) that just doesn't really appeal to me.
He's about watching more than interacting with, on some level.
Still, he IS more interactive than most of these types of toys, so I would recommend him over most of these types.
And he's tolerably soft, more so than expected.
O, and I somehow thought he would be bigger."
"We got this as a Christmas gift for both my 6 month old and 2 1/2 year old daughters.
It stands easily and is pretty sturdy.
It has a switch so you can adjust the volume (there are 2 volume settings plus off).
It's fabric is thin and smooth, so it's easy to wipe down, which is a plus since it can't be put into the washing machine.
There are a few things about this toy that I'm not crazy about.
The first is that when it dances, you can hear the joints moving and squeaking, often louder than the songs.
Also, unlike the other learning puppy, it only has buttons to make it sing on the feet.
All the body parts are labeled (the ears have ""Up"" on one and ""Down"" on the other), but if you squeeze or touch them, it doesn't do anything-that makes this toy more boring than the other Learning Puppy that Fisher Price makes.
Overall, it's an OK toy, but doesn't really do a whole lot-if you want a learning, singing puppy, I'd go with the original Learning Puppy made by them!"
"First - my major gripe with this entire line of toys.
The marketing is misleading.
The photographs make it appear that the toy is much larger than it is.
One photo shows the toy standing chest-high on what appears to be a three year old.
Another shows it taller than a sitting child.
The toy is not that tall.
Unlike the other toys in the series, only the feet are touch-pads.
Even though the ears, hands and belly are also labeled, they have to touch-pads or contacts.As others have complained, the mechanicals are loud.
I was surprised at the volume, and it is so loud that the audio from the toy is almost drowned out.
There is also a high/low volume control.
When it's not moving, the audio volume is fine.
When it starts doing it's thing, it looks cute - but if my car engine sounded like this things motor and transmission I'd take it to a mechanic ASAP.It's a hard plastic shell with clothes.
No padding - so it is not something your child can actively play with - more like a toy you'll set in front of him or her, show where to press on the feet, and stand back.
It sings, dance, etc.
and will hold a child's attention when it moves.A friend stopped by a couple of times with her 4 month old - she was enthralled with this puppy.
Although she was too young to actually play with it, she would watch non-stop whenever we had it dance, sing, etc.
"I was offered the Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Dance and Play Puppy through the Amazon Vine program.
Since I have a 17 month old toddler, I was excited at the chance for her to try out this toy.I noticed that some of the reviews here mention the size of the toy and how they were surprised that it was either smaller or bigger than anticipated.
I measured the dog, and it is just shy of 14 inches tall.
I think it is the perfect size for children in this age group, neither too big or too small.This is not a soft and cuddly toy, like the similar looking toy that we also own:Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Learning Puppy.
You can feel the hard plastic shell underneath the clothes of the dog.
A little bit of padding would have made the toy feel better, but perhaps it would have interfered with the animatronics.
This is a toy to watch and interact with, definitely not a toy to cuddle with at bedtime.
It uses 6 AA batteries, which are included.
Like most toys, the batteries are behind a compartment that requires a screwdriver to open.
That is a bit of a bother when the batteries need changed, but an excellent safety feature.My 17 month old daughter loves this toy, and I stress the word ""love"".
Since she received it several days ago, most of her other toys have been shunned in favor of this one.
She laughs at it, dances, tries to sing along with it, and carries it with her from room to room.
If she were the one writing this review, I am sure she would rate it 5 stars.My only real gripe with the toy (and the reason I rated it 4 stars) is that there are only two interactive places to press the body of the dog, both of which are on the feet.
If you look at the toy itself or at pictures of it, it appears that both hands and the stomach also have places to push.
The similar lookingFisher-Price Laugh & Learn Learning Puppyhas a total of seven interactive places, so I wrongly assumed that this toy would have more than only two.
For the first day that my daughter played with it, she kept trying to push the hands and stomach and was a little frustrated when nothing happened.
This puppy is so much fun.
He dances.
He sings.
He claps.
His ears go up and down.
More importantly, my 18 month old grandson loves him.
He plays with him ALL the time.
Luckily, I'm a grandma  so it doesn't get on my nerves.
HA.
HA.
My revenge.
My grandson carts him everywhere and probably isn't as gentle as he could be.
Others have complained that he isn't as cuddly as he could be but that works out fine with my grandson.
He has cuddly toys and this is fine as an every day toy that can stand up to some tough play.
The only quibble I have is the only interactive spots are the feet.
I wish you could press his hands or his ears.
Little children are going to love this toy!
For the very young, crawler child, this toy will be exciting because it wiggles, flaps it ears, and makes sounds/sings songs.
The actions alone are enticing and the child will be able to provide a gentle squeeze of a paw and instantly get a fun result - what power!
!The older toddler will love this for the same reasons as above, but will also be able to learn the songs.
Adults will be able to play and sing along teaching the music and songs to the child - a great exercise in memory and learning.The toy is furable, clothes and body are easy to wipe off and clean, and its cute face is inviting and friendly.This is going to be a great seasonal or birthday gift!
