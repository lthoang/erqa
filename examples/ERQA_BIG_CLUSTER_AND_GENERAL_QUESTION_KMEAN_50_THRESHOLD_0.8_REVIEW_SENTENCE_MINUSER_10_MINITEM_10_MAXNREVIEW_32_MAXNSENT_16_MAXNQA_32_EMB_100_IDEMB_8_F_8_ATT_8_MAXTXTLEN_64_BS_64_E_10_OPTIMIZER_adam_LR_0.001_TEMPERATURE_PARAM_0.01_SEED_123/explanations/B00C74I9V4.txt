Top sentence(s):
UNO Blast = UNO - fun.I unwrapped said toy from the box.
Not having to draw until you get a card that you can play is likely the biggest reason why the game goes so fast.VERDICT:While UNO Blast is fun, I don't think it's going to be replacing our regular UNO anytime soon.
Anyone can trigger the Blast feature and so the cards go flying into the air and the person who triggered the blast must now take responsibility for them.Wild Blast: This new card can be leveraged during the game and it requires that someone draw and discard until triggering an explosion.
We love Uno in this house so we were very excited to get the chance to check out the UNO Blast Card Game.
My sons enjoyed the classic aspect of the game, but my grandson went absolutely crazy over the blast aspect!

Reviews:
Who knew they needed to redo the old UNO game?This game is a lot more fun with a twist.
It becomes loud, noisy, obnoxious, and a bit more fun with a few extra cards thrown in.
It would be almost better to play with people who are unfamiliar with the old rules, so that one isn't comparing the old vs new game.The game provides hours of entertainment, if not necessarily an educational value.
For that the price tag is worth it, although one can always buy an UNO deck of cards and play peacefully with that instead.UNO bringing families together since 1971.
Our grandkids ages 6 - 8 are crazy about UNO (the adults like it to).
When I saw this device that periodically and irreverently shoots all the discarded cards flying through the air at one time I knew I had found the device that would add more giggles and fun to our bi-monthly UNO games.
The grandkids were all over this when I showed them what it was and what it does and that whoever the cards blow up on are stuck with having to add all the card to their hands, they were dragging still visiting Mom's and Dad's to the dining room table to try out this new trinket.
We all had a blast, especially when one particular grown up (fortunately the one with the best sense of humor) keep getting blasted with all the cards time and time again.
The device runs smooth and is easy to set up and use.
Lots of fun.
Great memory maker , and memories are priceless.
"Batteries are NOT included in this game.
You'll need 3 AA batteries.It's always fun to occasionally throw a twist onto an old game.
If you're in the mood for a little added noise and chaos during your game of Uno, this Blast game is a great addition to the game closet.
Sometimes, you just can't beat a nice, ""quiet"", old fashioned game of Uno, though.
At this stage in my life I prefer the quiet version, but it's nice to have this option around for when our children want to play."
"UNO is a fun game.
My family has played UNO tons of times.
UNO = fun.
UNO Blast = UNO - fun.I unwrapped said toy from the box.
My wife said, ""I like UNO, let's play"".
So we loaded the blaster up with the required 3 AA batteries and proceeded to play.
Until the BLAST went off.
At which my wife said to me, ""it's evil, kill it!"".
I reached for the blaster and realized that the creators of UNO Blast did not include a volume switch.
This would have been handy as the only blasting that I did was the soiling of my pants every time the ear-splitting shriek went off.On a positive note, the game included UNO.
We'll be keeping the cards handy.
Not so for the blaster."
Forget about a relaxing time playing card this Uno Blast is very noisy you will never get relax when you know the cards will pop out, you'll need to learn new boring rules, I prefer the classic UNO, this game is too unpredictable, noisy and stressfully for me.
"Mattel seems to be coming out with a new variation of UNO every six months or so, and the results have been a bit mixed.
Waterproof cards, as in theUNO H2O Card Game, were a brilliant idea just for the extra durability, though the plastic clip that comes with the punched onesUNO H2O To Go Card Gameis useless.UNO Spinwith the regular sized cards adds an interesting twist, but the miniature cards that come with theUNO Spin Game To Goare unshuffleable, rendering the game all but unplayable.
TheUNO Roboto Gameseems like an awful lot just to allow you to randomly activate some self-entered house rules that appear guaranteed to produce endless arguments, and the eminently portableUNO Dice Gamecan only be played by two people.So it was with some hope but a great deal of skepticism that I approached this new UNO variation.
Fortunately, UNO Blast turns out to be a (mostly) pretty good alternative to those a bit bored with the Original.
Besides the fun of the noise (not terribly loud IMHO but not adjustable in volume either) and the action of shooting cards up in the air (but not too high or too far; you could play this game on almost any size table without having to pick up cards off the floor), what this version primarily offers is an increase of luck, of randomness, perhaps making it a better choice than the original for a group of players made up of Newbies and Experts.
This primarily manifests itself in the differences in how the Draw cards work.
In the Original you know exactly who will get exactly how many cards when you play a Draw card, but in this version (unless there are already 4 cards in the Card Blaster) you don't know who will eventually get stuck with the 1 card from playing the Draw One Card (might even be you!)
or exactly how many (except that it will be at least 1 more than the number already in the Card Blaster) cards the person you play the UNO Blast Card on will get stuck with (could be as few as 1 or as many as 5).
In contrast the rule about placing the card you draw when you cannot (or choose not to) play a card in one of the slots of the Card Blaster removes the chance of drawing and playing a card that changes things.Perhaps the most interesting other new wrinkle is the Discard Color Card, which allows you to discard every card you have of the matching color, with the top card (your choice) being the one that continues play.
If all you had left were cards of the same color, a Discard Color Card of the same color would allow you to go out despite having more than one card in your hand.
(Just remember to shout ""UNO"" as you play your second to last card prior to playing your last card to avoid the penalty draw!)Defects?
Just one, where they got a little cheap IMHO.
The Card Blaster has a lid on top you can flip up revealing a slot that will hold the deck of cards...standing straight up.
While this makes for a striking display, it is a poor way to store the cards, especially for travel.
A slightly larger Card Blaster with room for a storage compartment that could hold the entire deck with the lid closed would have been a LOT more useful."
"UNO BLAST is a blast!!!
Okay, so that's cheesy, but this game really is a lot of fun.
Basically, what they've done is take away the ""draw four"" card and replaced it with this device that you have a chance of getting 1 to 5 cards shot into the air at you.
All three of my kids enjoyed playing this game (and one of them is a teenager!!!).
This is a great renovation of a classic game that the entire family can enjoy.
It's a blast!!!"
My 7 year old grandson had an absolute blast with this game!
Uno has always been a favorite in our hous, and this version makes it fun for all ages.
My sons enjoyed the classic aspect of the game, but my grandson went absolutely crazy over the blast aspect!
Great addition to this family classic.
The only drawbacks are that it DOES make noise, and that it requires batteries.
I prefer my board games to be battery free.
I really like UNO and was excited to get and play this game.
My family loves playing games and this one looked fun.
It plays pretty much like all other uno games except you put the cards you draw into the 5 blaster slots until it either blasts 1-5 cards out.
We reALly loved UNO attack and thought this would be just as fun.
It is not.
It isn't as exciting as it or regular Uno.
My kids thought it was fun and it does help them recognize colors and nbets but overall it is just an ok game that missed the mark.
Given the  opportunity I thought I nab this.
I seek out new and different games for our family of 6 but with this game I have to minus the 2 year old.
Game time is usually known around our parts either on Saturday nights or Sunday afternoons.
If your interested in changing tradition, The Card Blaster,  is not so bad.
It does makes a silly noise when you put a card in, and when it ejects cards, they fly up in the air high enough to be ridiculously fun.
Recommend.
From a kids point of view, we let our kids help with this review.
Enjoy!From the first time I saw the UNO blaster I was curious of how it works.The first game we played was a bit harder than if you think because I didn't read the directions.
There are some confusing parts but you get used to it one you play a few games.Likes of the UNO blasterIts portable, you can play anywhere.You can't never seem to know what may happen if you have to draw a card.The cards look cool.Made with good plastic.Dropped it a couple of times and it still works.Nice change from the regular UNO.Anyone can play this game.This game is full of game strategy and it depends on how you play.Dislikes of the UNO blasterAfter you play like 10 games it kind of gets boring I sometimes wish there were different things you can do with the blaster that comes with the game.Sometime the game cuts off in the middle of the game.
Not a big deal but gets annoying after the 5th time.The UNO cards could be made a bit better.
The bend and get worn out pretty easy.OverallYou really should get the game.
It is entertaining and fun.
If you do plan on getting it I hope you enjoy the game as much as I did.
I understand that to remain relevant in the increasingly competitive game marketplace, classic games have continued to evolve.
They seem to feel that they must incorporate all kinds of bells and whistles to attract new and younger users.
With UNO, we've already been through Attack and Flash and Spin and now we've got Blast.
I suppose a higher consumer price point doesn't hurt the decision to go bigger but, trust me, bigger isn't always better.
As an adult gamer, part of UNO's enduring charm is that it appealed to all ages.
For my taste, UNO Blast skews younger than previous titles released under the UNO brand.
That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it reduces the replayability factor for me.Set-up: Unit requires 3 AA batteries, so make sure you have some on hand or purchase with the game.Players: Suggests 2-6 players.
Personally, I think it should be three or more.
The game simply flows better when more players are incorporated.Rules/Game Play: Many of the cards will be familiar to UNO users such as Skips, Reverses, Draw Twos, and Wild Cards.
Now, though, the deck also incorporates Wild Blast.
Experienced UNO players might be attempted to intuitively navigate the new game, assuming they know how to do everything (sound familiar?
), but I had to reference the instructions several times.
The big difference in regular game play is that discards go right into one of five slots on an electronic game board called the card blaster.
Anyone can trigger the Blast feature and so the cards go flying into the air and the person who triggered the blast must now take responsibility for them.Wild Blast: This new card can be leveraged during the game and it requires that someone draw and discard until triggering an explosion.
Not very nice, is it?Considerations: As I said, kids might like the chaotic nature of UNO Blast.
It's amusing enough without adding much actual dimension to the game.
It's not UNO Attack but it's fun enough.
And no, it's not the original UNO but neither are any of the other UNO games that have followed the original UNO, but we keep buying/trying them don't we.My household is a UNO house.
When UNO comes out with something new we will try it.
This UNO Blast was in no way a failure.
It's a little different but it is fun.
It is not a run to game but it is not an Oh My God throw it out or stick it in the back of the closet and never play it again either.
What I am saying is I guess its a preference choice here.
"Usually these additions to classical games are just kind of novelties, but this one really adds a high-pressure element to UNO.
I had some children test it out for me and they literally had a blast.
They already knew how to play UNO, but I let them figure out the instructions on this new game.
They figured it out fairly quickly and were very excited at the gameplay.This is no ""Wild Card"", it's a Blast!
I'd recommend adding this to the game library for sure."
We love Uno in this house so we were very excited to get the chance to check out the UNO Blast Card Game.
The game changes up some of the rules of UNO while keeping the basic premise the same - but is it really a fun game?PROS:-A new way to play!
It's always fun to have a little change when you have a classic game, and the UNO Blast definitely changes up the rules, requiring that you put any card you have to draw into the Blast unit, and adding a few new cards that definitely make the game different.-Blast unit is fun!
The unit is actually really fun, even when you're not playing!
My kids spent a half an hour (or more!)
putting cards in and watching them pop out, as well as trying to guess which slot was the one that triggered the pop up!CONS:-Fast game - all of the Blast games we've played so far went much faster than the regular UNO games, taking 10 minutes (or even less in one occasion!)
to finish the game.
Good if you want to do a number of games, bad if you want to have a longer, more involved game.-Missing old UNO - While we liked playing the new game, we did admit to missing some of the facets of the old game.
Not having to draw until you get a card that you can play is likely the biggest reason why the game goes so fast.VERDICT:While UNO Blast is fun, I don't think it's going to be replacing our regular UNO anytime soon.
It's definitely fun for a little bit, and I have a feeling it'd be a blast during a party, but it's not something that we'll be playing all the time.
"The idea is simple- when you have to draw a card because you can't play any that round, the card you draw goes into a slot on the side instead of into your hand.
Once you put a card in a slot, you will hear a tone indicating whether you are ""safe,"" or if the cards in the slots are all going to be popped out onto the table.Kudos to the inventors of the packaging for this device- it was MUCH easier to unpack than most things.
Three simple knobs you turn on the bottom of the holder and it's out.Batteries not included.
Takes 3 AA's.I don't particularly like the ""discard into the UNO blaster"" rules for the game.
Somehow that just seems wrong.
Part of the fun of the game was watching someone's hand get larger as they had to keep drawing cards when they couldn't play.
But, this is ok.It says to put only one card into a slot.Since there are 5 slots, I wondered ""what do you do if there are more than 5 discards?""
The answer: Don't worry.
The machine pops out cards often enough it will never get to more than 5 discards.The timing of the ""blaster"" is random enough that there is no detectable pattern.
The item is well made."
"This new twist on the class UNO game, prompted big excitement for our six-year-old UNO master, who couldn't wait to try it out.
And he did mostly enjoy it for two rounds, but then wanted to go back to ""regular"" UNO ...
Which is kind of how my husband and I felt, too.The device here is that instead of picking up cards and putting them into your own hand when you can't play, you put them into the ""blaster"" where a beep either indicates you're ""safe,"" or all the cards currently in the hopper pop out and you must put them into your hand.
Unlike the way we, at least, play regular UNO, you don't keep drawing until you can play.
You just take one card if you have no playable options in your hand already and put it into the blaster if it can't be played.
(If the card you pick up can be played, you skip the blaster altogether.)
This way, you couldn't possibly have to pick up more than five cards--all the blaster will hold before blasting off--far fewer than often occurs in the regular game.
So, a perk could be, that this one will be shorter.
None of our Blast games lasted longer than about 15 minutes, while we've had epic standard UNO games at our house, going through the deck 6, 7, or even 10 times before finally having a winner.It's OK as a novelty, but again I don't see it replacing regular UNO for our family, even with fairly frequent game nights.
It's also seems awfully pricy for what is essentially a pop-up card dispenser where batteries aren't even included.
(TIP: Have 3 double AAs ready.
)The ""good"" part is that the UNO cards that come with it, are the standard deck and can be used for regular play, sans blaster.
But when you can get those same cards for a fraction of this set's cost in just about every store in the country, I'd save the money and just go for the classic game, which has remained a family favorite for generations for a reason."
My family has really been enjoying playing this UNO Blast game.
My husband and I play with our 11-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son.Blast- This version is a lot of fun.
There are 5 slots in the Blast Unit.
Players must insert cards into the unit for various reason.
The unit is rigged so that 1 of the 5 slots will trigger all the cards in the unit to Blast out.
When a player inserts a card into that slot all of the cards will blast out and that player must add them to their hand.
It could be 1-5 cards.
It's very random so you never know who will get blasted with the cards.
It's all in the luck of which slot you choose to place your card.Length- We have played several versions of this game and this has to be one of our favorites.
My husband isn't much of a gamer but he enjoys this game because it doesn't take ages to play.
Now I've got to admit I've never in my life played UNO where you actually keep score.
We always play first one out wins the game.
We usually play several games this way so it doesn't tie us down to an hour+ long game.
This version seems to go much quicker because when you need to draw a card, you instantly insert it into the Blast Unit meaning most of the players hands aren't filling up with cards so the games seems to take a lot less time than a normal game of UNO does.Set-Up & Storage- There really is anything to set-up with this game.
It comes with great instructions to have you playing the game in a matter of minutes.
I like the fact that this unit comes with a little storage area for the cards so when the game is not in use, it's easy to just set the cards in and move the unit aside.
"Let's start out with the bad: the packaging is SO cheap.
The game just comes in a cardboard wrap, not a real box.
The problem with this?
After unpackaging you're left with the blast unit and a stack of cards, with nowhere to securely store the cards.
You can place them in the half-slot area on top of the blaster, but they're not actually secured there.
The instructions say to ""place it on the shelf"".
I don't know about you, but I don't have a lot of extra, open shelf space in which to store an oddly-shaped precariously packaged card game.Now the good: Besides the storage issues we had a great time playing the game as a family.
We played this game with our two kids, and even though they're under the age of 7 we all still had a ""blast!""
It's easy to play, even if you've never played Uno before.
The cards blasting out provide lots of surprising fun.
The kids can grow into this game and play it for years to come."
