Top sentence(s):
I enjoyed the glow-in-the-dark aspect, although honestly I didn't see the puzzle in the dark except to purposely see it with all the lights out.The pieces are well cut and go together easily.
The picture is very nice with a lot of variety, perhaps with the exception of the pink sky which took the longest to fit in place.
(No, you're not going to be using your fist to pound them into position.
This one in particular is a very high quality product from Ravensburger (as usual), all the pieces have an excellent finishing and they stick together very well.
This is a quality puzzle and I'd definitely buy another Ravensburger puzzle.

Reviews:
"Ravensburger makes some excellent paper puzzles.
This one is no exception.
There isn't a whole lot to write about jigsaw puzzles aside from quality of image and construction.As I've noticed with other Ravensburger puzzles, the pieces are cut cleanly.
None of them were stuck together (i.e., not cut apart) in the box.
They fit together without any inordinate difficulty.
(No, you're not going to be using your fist to pound them into position.
)The image quality is good.
The assembled puzzle presents a vista of Rome at dusk.
The colors are rich and it is a relaxing scene.
This is one of Ravensburger's ""Starline"" puzzles, so it has some glow-in-the-dark paint/ink on it that traces contours.
Our kids think it's fun to switch off the lights.
Not really a useful feature, but it is mildly amusing for the kids.In all, a worthwhile puzzle with enough pieces to be challenging for a family for an afternoon."
This puzzle was fun to put together.
It was fairly difficult to assemble, which made it more of a challenge, which I like.
The glow in the dark feature is really cool.
It helped me connect some of the pieces easier.
The only thing I would change would be for the glowing to be brighter as it's a little dull.
The instructions include German and English and possibly French.
My family and I enjoyed finishing this puzzle together.
Who would have thought that such an old pastime could be so entertaining for everyone?
It was really cool to turn off the light at night and see the picture glowing on the table.
It almost looked like it was floating midair.
We had a few mishaps with my sister's hyper Boston Terrier getting to the puzzle from her lap, but the pieces were locked together pretty good and we didn't get set back by much.
As usual, Ravensburger has made a top quality puzzle with durable pieces.
I love that the pieces are well designed so that it is hard to force pieces where they don't belong.
I look forward to more Ravensburger puzzles!
Disclaimer: I am reviewing a copy that I received for free through the Vine program.Well our autistic daughter seems to like this puzzle, and has completed it twice now.
I think it took her a few days each time, less than a week.The picture (Evening in Rome, lots of lights reflecting on the water etc.)
is interesting.
The puzzle pretty sturdy and durable, looks like the pieces won't get messed up as easily as with some other jigsaw puzzles.
And it looks pretty difficult to me, but she enjoys it.
"This Ravensburger puzzle (EVENING IN ROME) was frustratingly fun.
A beautiful sunset over a bridge in Rome provides a subtly challenging scene to piece together.
A nice finishing touch to the puzzle is that it glows in the dark.As someone who only occasionally takes the time to put puzzles together, I found this 1000 piece puzzle to be enjoyably challenging.
I particularly like the scene and the fine details within the scene as I pieced it together (most notably the graffiti on the walls under the bridge).
Subtle color changes to a relatively clear sky that comprises roughly a quarter of the puzzle proved to somewhat frustrating to piece together, as were duplicate light reflections on the shimmering water.
The pieces securely snap together and the completed puzzle presents a beautiful scene that glows (subtly) in the dark.My only issue with this puzzle is that the reference picture on the front of the box is partially obscured by ""text-box"" that advertises the puzzle's features (my box was not the same as the one shown on this site)."
"For reference, this is the second 1,000 piece puzzle my wife and I have worked on in a row.
The first was a cheap no-name puzzle which I will compare this ""premium"" puzzle to with pros and cons.
Here they are:Pros:* Linen-matte finish.
This finish is much better at deflecting lighting glare then the cheap puzzle's matte finish was.
* Piece quality.
Each piece was solid and felt durable enough to handle multiple puzzle assembly and teardown cycles.
Unlike the cheap puzzle I didn't come across any pieces that were splitting out of the box.
* Very good picture resolution.
None of the picture details are smeared into an unrecognizable mess.
* Container.
The box teh puzzle comes in is additionally very durable feeling.
* Interlocking.
Pieces fit together really well.Glow in the dark.
* Glow actually works pretty well and looks cool.
It also doesn't detract from the ability to discern which piece goes where, and can sometimes help.Cons:* Picture is obscurred.
Because of the feature blurb on the cover (which is incentally on the other side of the box unlike what is pictured) there isn't a good sized un-obscurred view of puzzle to be had.
This is a charming puzzle that is just a little different from others in its luminosity.First of all: the quality of the puzzle pieces is top notch.
You know when they fit.
Nothing is missing.
It's a no hassle puzzle, so you can focus on solving it.Secondly, the image is pretty and we enjoyed talking about Rome as we assembled this.
The glow in the dark is noticeable, though I found it easier to assemble in the light.
We tried a blacklight and it really highlighted the colors, but that's not necessary.
One thing the glowing helped with was getting kids to put down the video game and join the family fun.Finally, I think these puzzles are well worth the price.
You're spending a tick more, but you get a much more pleasant several hours with your family.
Puzzles have become a tradition whenever my wife's family gets together, and I will be incorporating that into my side as well.
It gives everyone something to do and talk about.
Beautiful puzzle and the glow in the dark is great, this puzzle is difficult but you will enjoy it if you like challenges, the pieces are small but they fit perfectly, the colors, design and quality are the best.
Puzzle fans will love the Evening in Rome 1000-piece Starline Glow-in-the-Dark Puzzle from Ravensburger.
My son and his friend always have a puzzle-in-progress on our downstairs table and they will have a ball working on this particular puzzle.Not only does this beautiful 27 x 20-inch scenery puzzle glow in the dark but it is a high-quality piece made by a world-leading manufacturer and designer of puzzles whose hallmarks are durability and quality.The Evening in Rome puzzle is made with an extra-thick cardboard and fine, linen-structured paper to create a glare-free puzzle image.
Ravensburger's steel cutting tools are designed and crafted by hand so that no two pieces are alike and so that each piece has a perfect interlocking fit.
The Starline puzzle uses special luminous inks to transfer the puzzle image and produce a spectacular multi-color glow-in-the-dark effect.Founded in 1891, and in 2012 acclaimed as the world's greatest puzzle brand, the German-based company employs more than 1,400 workers.
Ravens burg has 8,000 different products - 85 percent of which they make themselves.Personally I lack the patience to work on puzzles but my son and friend attest to the quality of pieces and challenge of assembly.
I join them in proclaiming the stunning beauty of this glow-in-the-dark masterpiece when finished.
The attraction to a glow-in-the-dark puzzle is curious, but not something that will cease amazement for very long at all.The picture that this puzzle creates is nothing spectacular and is in fact, blurry and poor quality.I would have been more satisfied had the picture been clear or well detailed.This puzzle is pretty difficult to put together, but a nice rainy day or relaxed evening project.The children in my family were at first very enticed by the idea of the glow-in-the-dark aspect, which soon faded away.Overall, I think it would be a much finer puzzle if the photo was more refined.
Poor photo equals poor puzzle, that is my opinion.
There is NO comparison between this puzzle and those you find in the average store.
The pieces are thicker, stiffer, and they click together with precision.
The finish has sort of a matte look because I think they use linen behind or through the paper to reduce glare and improve the image.
I found the glow in the dark feature a bit odd, but the kids loved it.
They even tried (unsuccessfully) to solve it in the dark.
If you are into quality puzzles, this is one of the best.
I agree with the other reviewers whole-heartedly.
This is a high-quality puzzle and the picture is beautiful.
I've never had a puzzle so nice.
The quality even extends to the puzzle dust in the bottom of the box - there hardly is any!
I would definitely buy Ravensburger puzzles again.
I have one more from them, a 300-piece puzzle of some children at bathtime, that is equally beautiful.
This puzzle was a real challenge from the beginning.
Of course you do the usual sorting the border bits from the interior bits, but after that is where the real fun began.
There are so many subtle colors and intricate reflections, that it was quite a challenge to try to sort out the interior pieces by color and pattern.
In some areas I had to resort to sorting by shape so I could find enough pieces that fit together so I could determine where they fit in the overall pattern.I waited until the entire puzzle was completed before allowing myself to enjoy the glow-in-the-dark view.
Since it was an especially challenging piece of work, I was thrilled to have a special treat on top of the completed puzzle.
An extra bonus is that the individual pieces are very sturdy, so it will survive far more rounds than the average puzzle.
Love this Starline puzzle!
I am a true 'puzzle person' trying to do a 1000 piece puzzle at least once a month.
When I saw this puzzle I knew that I would love it.
The colors are vibrant and the picture is spectacular.
I love the evening shot with the reflection on the water with the Vatican in the background.
Reminds me truly of my trip to Rome in 2010.
I found the quality of the pieces of this puzzle to be highly constructed and, although challenging to complete, relatively easy to match and assemble.
I highly recommend this puzzle to anyone who loves puzzles and who has ever been (or wants to go) to Rome!
This puzzle is definitely the best puzzle I've ever owned!
All of the pieces are made of high quality, thick material and the pieces fit together nicely, unlike many other puzzles I've tried that you  have to basically pound the pieces into place because the material was cheap and they didn't line up right.
The finished scene is absolutely beautiful as well.
We've put it together twice and had a good time doing so.
This is the first glow in the dark puzzle I've ever put together and that's a cool feature that the kids love.
I own a preschooler board game from the Ravensburger company and all of their products are cream of the crop.
If you want real quality puzzles, I'd get them from this company and skip the cheaply made but expensive ones you find at local stores.
This is a great puzzle and a lot of fun to put together.
I enjoyed the glow-in-the-dark aspect, although honestly I didn't see the puzzle in the dark except to purposely see it with all the lights out.The pieces are well cut and go together easily.
This is a quality puzzle and I'd definitely buy another Ravensburger puzzle.
I am a puzzle maniac, having assembled jigsaw puzzles from 100 to 9000 pieces (a 13200 pieces is in the queue and I am really going to the 18,000 and 32,000 pieces from Ravensburger in the future...).
Some of them were 3D puzzles, like the Taj Mahal, US Capitol, Neuschwanstein Castle, Big Ben, etc.
This one in particular is a very high quality product from Ravensburger (as usual), all the pieces have an excellent finishing and they stick together very well.
I usually assemble this size of puzzles in Foam Boards.
They are very light and conveniently cheap.
The foam board being 3/16'' (5mm) gives your puzzle enough support.
I usually cut the board (easily done with a cutter) after glueing the puzzle, leaving a border of 1'' at each side, so I can pin the board in my garage (that, at this point, is full of puzzles...).
For puzzles 5,000 pieces and larger I usually go with a 4'x8'x5/32'' plywood that I pre-cut at the size of the puzzle plus 1 inch extra on each side...
This is heavier and a little more expensive, but gives better support and for that size of puzzle I need that extra support.
You might be able to accommodate up to a 6,000 piece in one of those 4'x 8' (feet) boards.
So far I have assembled 2 x 5,000 pieces, 1 x 6,000, 1 x 8,000 pieces and 1 x 9,000, besides dozens of 3,000 and smaller.
What help me a lot is that my wife and daughters also like the challenge, so we move fast.
A 1,000 piece puzzle do not last a weekend, although the 8,000 piece one took us 2 months (most 2 to 3 hours at night work) to put together.
This one in particular took us 5 days to put together, as it has a good amount of sky and the reflections are never easy.
I highly recommend Ravensburger products for the excellent quality to everyone that enjoys challenges alone or with the whole family.
It is a guaranteed entertainment for hours, listening to music or talking in family environment.Amazon.com was kind enough to provide this product for me through their Vine Program for reviewing and I was not request to provide a positive review.
This puzzle is among the most challenging I have ever done.
However, it is not ridiculously hard - there are patterns to be found.
I am enjoying slowly constructing the picture of Paris at night, and the colors are very pleasing to the eye.
The Ravensburger quality to the pieces is noticeable and it is the reason why I continue to buy primarily Ravensburger puzzles.
As always, Ravensburger never let's you down with their puzzles.
They are quality pieces and fit together nicely.
The Evening in Rome is a nice picture, but I have to say, it is a bit more challenging (NOT impossible) than most 1000 piece puzzles.
My 86 year old father loves puzzles and can do them in his sleep, but this one took him a few extra moments!
He felt it was the color quality.
From what I could tell, it was more the glow in the dark feature!
Most people would not be able to tell the difference, but he sure did!
A lovely puzzle that you will certainly enjoy!
This 1000 piece glow-in-the-dark puzzle is so incredibly beautiful when complete.
The glow-in-the-dark aspect makes this puzzle top-notch.
This is the only puzzle that I've ever had the desire to glue and use as a decoration.
I think it would be really neat to have it hanging on my wall.Putting the puzzle together took me about 3-4 days off and on to complete.
Normally it wouldn't take so long but this wasn't a puzzle that has too many colors therefore it took quite a long time to do the sky, water and building portions when they all looked the same and they each took up about 1/3 of the puzzle.The quality of Ravensburger puzzles are usually superior but for some reason I had many pieces where the top layer (the picture potion) was peeling off of the piece itself.Overall, I really love this puzzle once complete.
It's breathtaking.
Putting it together was fun and challenging but time-consuming.
I would recommend this puzzle.
We also love that it glows in the dark!
It is fun for the whole family.
A little challenging with all the black and pink, but the glowing in the dark is the big pay off.
high quality puzzle.
We started this puzzle as a family, but I ended up doing most of it and I enjoyed it very much.
The puzzle is a nice size to have on the dining room table (covering it with a table cloth allowed us to continue eating meals for those couple of days).
I like to start puzzles by fitting the outside edges together first, so I separated those pieces.
They were easy to find because they were slightly taller than the inside pieces and could be spotted in the pile.
All the pieces are sturdy and unique so it is clear when you've put the correct pieces together.
The picture is very nice with a lot of variety, perhaps with the exception of the pink sky which took the longest to fit in place.
Also, the substance that glows in the dark could be used to fit pieces together by lining up the track of it across the pieces.
Upon completion, the glow in the dark feature worked very well in a darkened room.
That was the most exciting part for the kids.There were a few things I didn't like.
The puzzle backing is blue and there were so many bits of blue dust that came out of the plastic bag.
It was all over my hands and coating the table.
It has been a while since I opened a brand new puzzle, so I can't recall if this is normal or not.
It also may have seemed worse since it was blue instead of brown or gray.
There were critters that did like it though.
I found several tiny brown bugs crawling around the pieces as well as two baby silverfish.
The puzzle and it's pieces were sealed properly, so I'm not sure at which step they got into the box, but I opened it a few hours after receiving it so they likely didn't come from my house.
