Top question(s):
Removing profiles? How do I remove a profile (or more) from the InnoTab 2?  We bought this for my son and his sister's set up a bunch of other profiles; I'm struggling to find a way to remove those.
I have an 8 year old daughter--very smart. Would the Inno Tab be worth the money for an 8 year old and if not, any other suggestions for under $100?
Top sentence(s):
We've had Leapster products for so long, and it seems like they are just releasing the same game in a different format (Leap Pad, Leapster, etc.)
To quote the resident four-year-old, ""Mommy, there's too much fun stuff on this one.
UPDATE: the InnoTab doesn't have a gel skin accessory, just a screen guard you can purchase.
They stylus works beautifully.Finally, it's extremely rugged and kid friendly.
We got the original Innotab for my two year old son because of the Cars and Thomas game packs.

I want to get my 3 year old granddaughter either a inno tab 2 or the leap pad 2 . I don't want her to outgrow it too fast . Which one?

I have an 8 year old daughter--very smart. Would the Inno Tab be worth the money for an 8 year old and if not, any other suggestions for under $100?

Reviews:
"My daughter has the Leap Pad2 and my son now has the InnoTab, so it was nice to compare them side by side.Pros for the InnoTab:  I love the camera design.
The Leap Pad2 has two cameras, one in the front and one in the back.
InnoTab's design has a rotating camera, so you can switch it from front to back.
My son says this adds extra coolness, which I must say I agree, it was a nice touch.
This also has a neat photo editing lab where the kids can add in stamps, borders and change colors.
I'd say this is a tie for Leap Pad/InnoTab.
Sound quality is good.
I like the rubber bumpers on the InnoTab.
Both products say they are for ages 3-9, but I think the InnoTab is actually geared towards the younger crowd.
That being said, if my son happens to drop the InnoTab, I feel like it has more protection with the bumper.
I also like the wide variety of games and stories you can get on the InnoTab.
We've had Leapster products for so long, and it seems like they are just releasing the same game in a different format (Leap Pad, Leapster, etc.)
With the InnoTab, it's a whole new set of things to choose from, including some choices Leap Frog does not have, like Hello Kitty.Cons:  The screen size is the same, but I think the clarity is better on the Leap Pad2.
Also, as another reviewer has mentioned, there's a longer lag in loading on this product as compared to the Leap Pad2.
It's not as noticeable to my younger child, but my six year old gets frustrated at times waiting for each game section to load.
I also think the screen is more responsive in the Leap Pad2 - some games require some precision in tapping just the right spot for an answer, and we've had times with the InnoTab where my son will press the correct spot on the screen, but nothing will happen unless he repeatedly presses or moves a fraction over to the left of the correct answer.Overall, InnoTab is a solid learning device, and I think it would be a fantastic first ""tablet"" for younger kids.
We got the original Innotab for my two year old son because of the Cars and Thomas game packs.
Plus, it reduced his desire to use (and potentially damage) the iPad.
This Innotab is a slight improvement over the original, as it features a camera.The selection of physical cartridges for the Innotab series seems on-par with the other brands, so that wasn't a concern when choosing this device.
We haven't signed up online to download new ones yet.What is a concern is the rate at which the batteries are drained.
One or two days use (depending on use) is all you will get.
I actually think its more like 6-8 hours.My son enjoys the built-in apps as well.Overall, this is a great device.
If you own the original Innotab, upgrading to this isn't exactly needed.
This game is such a good entertainment for little ones :) My 2 1/2 year old great grandaughter was here for the weekend and I brought this out and she had it figured out before she left on Sunday.
I was so surprised to see how easy she was able to pick it up.
She was using the camera and making little stories out of them.
She was so funny and had us laughing all day.
She is also good with the games and was showing me how to play them.
I was amazed.
"HOW ARE LEAPPAD2 AND INNOTAB2 THE SAME?- Both have the same screen size (2 "" x 4 ""), or 5"" if you're measuring diagonally.- Both require 4 AA batteries (not included).- Both use a stylus.- Both have a cartridge port for additional games, and uses purchased apps.- Both have an age requirement of 3-9 years.
VTech's Amazon page says 4-9 years, but the box and VTech's website state 3-9 years.- Both have a camera.- Both have additional accessories you can buy like gel skins, cases, rechargeable batteries, ac adapters, and headphones.
UPDATE: the InnoTab doesn't have a gel skin accessory, just a screen guard you can purchase.
LeapPad you can purchase both separately.- Both can be personalize for up to 4 players.- Both have eReaders, MP3 Players (InnoTab's is free, LeapPad's is an additional $3.75 through their App store), art studio, and most of your basic themed books and games.- Both have a mic and volume control.- Some people like to creatively take the tablets out of the box for setup before handing to a child as a gift.
LeapPad2 was a bit difficult, but doable.
The InnoTab2 is a bit more of a challenge; just use sharp scissors to break the tape and fold out the box carefully.- Both have a parent tracker that allows parents to track their child's progress and success playing a game.HOW ARE LEAPPAD2 AND INNOTAB2 DIFFERENT?- The LeapPad2 is smaller.
Actually it looks like with InnoTab2 they were the same size, but they surrounded it with an additional "" layer of decorative plastic with rubber corners to help protect it from a fall.
For small hands I find it cumbersome.
Plus it makes the screen appear smaller.
But I do like the rubber corners.- The LeapPad2 has a front and back camera, but the InnoTab2 has only one camera that rotates (creative idea!
)- The battery compartment on the InnoTab is easily accessible.
Just slide a switch and it opens the compartment.
I prefer LeapPad's more secure sliding feature.
But if you're using a gel skin on either that helps prevent access.- The LeapPad2 only comes with one stylus, the InnoTab2 comes with two; always a plus in case you loose or break one.
The InnoTab2 uses a secure rope loop but I looked everywhere in the packaging and there wasn't one!
Also, InnoTab's stylus is pure plastic, flat, and slippery.
"My daughter has had the VTech InnoTab first generation for a year now and she loves it.
I really didn't know if the new one would have enough differences to warrant an upgrade.I was wrong.
To quote the resident four-year-old, ""Mommy, there's too much fun stuff on this one.
I don't know where to start!
""And she's right - this is simply fun.
It comes with a few apps installed and when you register online you get two more apps for free.
I also bought her a couple of learning games featuring some of her favorite Nick Jr. Characters.By far the best feature is the new camera.
Instead of just a camera, it comes with all sorts of fun camera effects.
Backgrounds, mirror camera, one that makes any picture look like a kaleidoscope, stretchy pictures - not only has my daughter not gotten bored yet, but even the adults in our family can't keep their hands off it!
(Note: the pictures seem to come out best when taken outdoors in natural light.
)The stylus seems more sensitive now.
In the first generation tablet, there were times when my daughter would get very frustrated because the Tablet wouldn't respond when she touched it.
No problems here.
They stylus works beautifully.Finally, it's extremely rugged and kid friendly.
Speaking from experience, it stands up to being dropped by four-year-old hands.Simply put, the VTech InnoTab 2 is a hit."
I gave this to my 4-year-old  nephew to play with the last time he was visiting and he barely put it down the entire weekend.
It's perfect for his age level -- challenging, yet still fun for a young child.
He figured out all the bells and whistles on his own, without needing any help from me (and just a tiny bit of help from his dad in the beginning).
The hardest part was learning to swipe from page to page, but he picked it up pretty quickly.So far, the interactive ereader seems to be his favorite part of the Innotab, but he also really loves the rotating camera and using the stylus.
He has taken SO many pictures of himself.The features are great (storage, wall adaptor, etc.
), but it does eat batteries really fast.
We use rechargeables and try to have it plugged into the wall as much as possible.I haven't tried out the LeapPad, but this works great for our family!
