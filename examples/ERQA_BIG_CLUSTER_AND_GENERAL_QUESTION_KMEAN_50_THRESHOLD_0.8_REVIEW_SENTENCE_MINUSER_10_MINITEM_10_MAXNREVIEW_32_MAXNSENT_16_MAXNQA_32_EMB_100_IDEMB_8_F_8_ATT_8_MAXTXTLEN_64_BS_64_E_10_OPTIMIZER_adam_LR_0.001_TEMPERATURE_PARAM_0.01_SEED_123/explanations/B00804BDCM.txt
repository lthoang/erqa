Reviews:
"This has become one of my son's favorite ""go-to"" toys.
He's 18 months but is an early language adopter and already can say over 150 words.
He's started to learn some of his alphabet through the bus (A, E, H, and X are the  letters he can always correctly identify).What I like:* Sound is good and clear.
* Buttons are under the covering of the bus, which means they can't be pulled off, and spills wipe right up* The ""keys"" for music work so that when a kid plays along, it harmonized with the tune* It withstands repeated drops* There are 3 modes.
As a parent, if you get really tired of one, it's easy to switch to another.
And my son likes all 3, so it's painless to get him to interact with one of the other modes.
* It's light so he can carry it around and it fits well in a backpack for travelMy two suggestions for improvement:* He REALLY REALLY REALLY loves to turn it off and on because of the honking.
I'd suggest having a different feature where kids could push a button to make the bus honk, rather than having that sound tied into the on switch.
* There is a plastic backing on the top of the bus that acts almost as a stand - I'm doubtful that this piece will remain intact over a year's use.
While the product is light, he does drop it a lot.We purchased a LeapTop around the same time as this came from Vine.
I prefer this product, and would (and have!)
recommended it to my friends with young toddlers."
"I haven't given it to her yet, but I've been playing with this Learning Bus and I love it!
:)  It is perfect!The ""Touch Magic"" is the best feature of this, in my opinion.
There are no difficult buttons to press.
Even the littlest fingers can lightly tap the letters and pictures to make the sounds.
The box says it is for age 2+, but the ""Touch Magic"" makes it so easy to use that even littler ones could play with it.The animals in the school bus are cute, and there are letters, pictures, and a mini keyboard.
Everything you touch seems to make a sound - even the bus hubcaps become drums!
There are 40 different touch points, with 3 playing modes, for a total of over 200 sounds.
There is a Learn Mode, Game Mode, and Music Mode.This is an excellent way to help very young children learn the alphabet and improve their hand-eye coordination, all while having fun."
This was another one my daughter couldn't wait to play with as I was getting it out of the box.
This toy is fun and interactive with letters, letter sounds, and a colorful keyboard at the bottom.
Something that instantly caught my attention was that the keyboard would play more than one key sound at a time, which is a big deal to me.
I don't like it when you can't play more than one sound at a time on children's keyboards.
My daughter is probably on the young side for this toy at two years old.
Her favorite activity is turning it on...and then off.
Another bonus for this toy is it's size and weight.
It is quite light and thin, which makes it easy to pack in a diaper bag.
Overall, a great toy for children learning their alphabet and alphabet sounds.
"This Leapfrog Touch Magic Learning Bus is a huge success.
My 2 year old toddler loves it.
I thought it might be too young for him since he knows his alphabet but he will sit down with it and play with it each day several times.
He is even going around now making initial consonant sounds for words he says like ""b-b-b- Bus!"".
He loves the music and sings along as well as the sounds the different animals make.
He had 5 other little ones from 19 months to age 5 over the other day in his playroom and all played with it at some point and stepped on it, etc but it is VERY sturdy and made it through just fine.
Wonderful educational and fun toy for ages 18 months on through probably 5!"
I got this for my 2 year old granddaughter, and it has been a big hit.
The buttons are just the right size for little hands.
They're easy to push, requiring little pressure.
The variety of sounds and activities is perfect for keeping young minds entertained.As for learning, this is more a trial and error type of toy for the very young.
If they don't know the answer, nothing on the toy gives it to them.
They simply keep pushing until something else happens.Overall, it's a fun and often educational toy for both home and traveling.
This wonderful learning toy engages motor skills, listening, and helps a child learn the alphabet, etc.
in a very entertaining way.
I love the 'sing a long' music feature that can be used for very young children who perhaps are not ready for the other skills just yet.
The bright colors also add excitement to the learning process.
You can also visit an online site for help with how to best use all the features, learning ideas, etc.
I always think educational toys should have this available.
LeapFrog has put a lot of thought into this wonderful learning tool and it is fun for adults to play with too, making it a grand adventure for both child and parent/grandparent.
Children are expected to be so much more advanced before they even start kindergarten (much more so than when I started school), so great teaching tools like the Magic Learning Bus are always a welcome addition to a young child's toy box.
I prefer these types of fun learning games over flash cards (which often cause more pressure than learning at tender ages).
This is a good way to learn your letters.
Every child that has used this enjoyed it and did not want to give it up.
It is a lot of fun to play with, the child may not even realize that they are learning!
It is geared more toward individual play, it is hard to share the toy without the children all trying to push buttons before each sentence is completed.
There is music as well as the alphabet, so it can get quite noisy if you are sitting close by.
I would recommend you purchase this for your child to use as they are learning their alphabet, they will love it.
This toy is recommended for 2 year olds, but I gave this to my 1 1/2 year old so that she could have her own Leap Frog toy while her older brother plays with the his Leap Pad.
We have the Leap Frog letter fridge magnets and she adores pushing those and signing the alphabet song, and although this toy does so much more, she only really likes to use the music feature on this toy.
There are three buttons that direct the mode of play.
There is a star that deals with finding the letters through sounds (though the sounds can be a little hard to make out, especially for little learning ears!
), a beach ball that is the game mode, and then a music note for playing songs.
I am amazed at how sensitive to the tough this little toy is.
I personally like that it is flat, but I almost feel that it makes it hard to use for my little one.
She can easily hit the wrong button.
I thought for sure the power button, which is also on the flat front side, would constantly be hit by her, but surprisingly she avoids it and there is a power button as well on the back.
I am still hopeful that she will explore more on this toy and use it for working on her letters and sounds, but maybe it is really better off for 2 years plus.
"This is another winner from LeapFrog.
Already adept with an iPad, my 2-year-old daughter had no trouble learning how to use the LeapFrog Touch Magic Bus.
She particularly likes to listen to the songs and play with the piano keys.
Ingeniously, when the songs are playing, all of the piano keys are keyed to make sounds from the same chord family as the song that is playing, so the piano sounds actually complement the song being played and do not create any dissonances.
This makes my 2-year-old feel like she's actually contributing to the song, and that's fun for her.
My only complaint is that I would love for this toy to have more songs (there are only three songs).As for the letters, it is nice to have a toy that has good sound quality and that enunciates the letters (and the sounds for each letter) well.
This is particularly important for young children who are still learning to speak.
My daughter doesn't have as much fun with the letters as with the songs, but I think she is learning from this aspect of the toy.Finally, there is a game mode that says things like, ""Find the letter K.""  This is a great mode for slightly older children who already know their letters well.
I think this game mode will make this toy appropriate and fun for a wide range of ages.
All in all, this is a great toy with lots of learning potential."
You can use this toy right from the minute you open the package.
Each letter has a sound associated with it.
My favourite is the Elephant's sound.
When you touch the letters a voice sounds out the letter and a sound associated with it.
The exploration phase where you are given a sound and asked to guess the letter it sounds like is tough for me, but once the kid learns the letters and sounds through the touch, it will be fun to guess the letters.
The music is fun too, with the keys at bottom, your kid will go crazy running the fingers across it.
Then there's the famous ' Now you know your ABCs' song.
If you do not use the bus for a while, it switches off by itself.
My son has been trying to play with this toy for awhile but hasn't really had much success.
Mostly he gets confused with it and slaps the whole thing to make sounds.
He's not sure how to use it because there are no buttons just a smooth surface.
It is an interesting idea for a toy but when they are interacting with it it just doesn't make sense.
I think this would be a much better toy if the interactive areas were buttons instead of a smooth surface.
This is a very light, colorful, musical toy which is great for car rides.
However, I have to deduct a star for educational value (even though I think LeapFrog is great), because my 2 year old frequently thinks she is pressing one letter, but gets another letter's soundbyte (because it's very easy to set off a letter sound if your sleeve touches the device while you're reaching for a higher letter).
Maybe for an older kid this wouldn't be an issue though.
The music is catchy and it's great the way you can play along with the piano and your accompaniment always sounds great.
The illustrations are a little creepy and not the usual Leapfrog Scout/Violet/Leap.
I like it that there is a learning option, a game option, or a music option.
It's challenging to hear the sound and find the corresponding icon - and sometimes I don't know what the correct answer is myself.
Lots of interesting non-standard selections (not the same old choices) and the sound quality is great.
I think at this fifteen buck price, it's a good deal.
My 26 month old showed a TON of interest in the store with it...then when we got it home, not so much...and now - at 27 months, she's all into it all of a sudden.
I think a slightly older child would get more out of the games - but I thnk even a much younger kid would have fun just playing around with cause and effect and pushing buttons).
"I have an 18-month old daughter who just about grabs and tinkers anything that catches her curious little mind.
I try to surround her with as much educational toys I can find so that playtime can also be a learning time.
As we parents know, the learning ability of toddlers are so amazing, they are like sponges where they absorb many things by what they see and hear.
The LeapFrog Touch Magic Learning Bus supplements that learning process by what a preschooler (or a toddler in my case) with things they would eventually experience when the time comes for them to start school.The LeapFrog Touch Magic Learning Bus has a flat surface with no protruding parts and everything can be operated by a simple touch.
The face of the bus has the alphabets on it and below the letters is an object or symbol corresponding to the first letter of the alphabet, i.e.
the letter A and apple.
With this method, a preschooler's visual stimulations can be trained in the basic alphabet and the corresponding object that start with a particular letter.
It did not take long for my daughter to get the hang of it.
The intuitive approach makes learning easy and fun.
I can see it in her eyes.The LeapFrog Touch Magic Learning Bus comes in 3 modes: Learning, Letter Exploration and Music.
In the learning mode, the bus tells them what it is exactly what they pressed, it will say ""BELL"" when the bell is pressed or ""DUCK' when the D is pressed.
The lower part of the face of the bus has has the multi-colored piano keys on it and plays a note and songs that the child can sing along when in the music mode.
The game mode lets the bus ask a question and for the child to find the answer to that question.I am very happy with my daughter's reaction with this educational toy.
It brings the art of learning and the sense of fun at the same time.
Very highly recommended!!"
"First off, Amazon shipped fast, received in good condition.
The product was superlight, great for my 1 year old who is starting to say his ""ABC's"" in his own little voice.
It is a flush board, no buttons, so its all touch based.
Comes with batteries.
My son played with it for 5 minutes and then threw it, a sign he likes it.
So far its held up to his throwing skills, and seems durable.
Will check back in a year or so with an update.
Overall, great and recommended."
I have a newly 6 year old son and a 22 month old daughter.
Both were drawn to the LeapFrog Learning Bus.My son loved the musicality of the toy.
The piano keys and drum keys sound very full and realistic.
The images on the bus of the animals are vibrant and friendly.This is certainly not the electronic school bus we grew up with.
I loved the smooth, flat surface because it is EASY to clean.
It won't get grimy like the kind with push buttons.Once again, LeapFrog has produced a quality product.
Although this toy is rated for 2+ years, I got it for my son when he was around 13 months.
He doesn't quite get all the features of the toy, but he has learned to turn it on and push all the different buttons.
He loves music, so he has a lot of fun getting it to play music.The bus is very thin and made me nervous that my son's rough play might break it.
He has stepped on it, banged it around, thrown it on the floor, and done all kinds of things to it.
The toy holds up well, no cracks, no breaks, and it still sounds like it did on day one.A good, fun toy for toddlers.
A great way to help learn the alphabet.
My daughter is 2.5 and we're just starting to talk about letters.
She loves this little bus (she's fascinated with the idea of school) and plays with it quite a bit.
I like that there is music along the bottom and some fun songs through the buttons at the top.
Very upbeat and fun sounding.
"First of all, before you start to use this sucker, realize that you have to hold your finger on the On/Off button for a couple seconds!
When I first tried it, I thought the batteries were dead, or that you need to pull some tab to expose the battery!
Nope, just have to hold your finger on the power button for a bit, and you're good to go.I like the fact that it's touch operated, not an actual button that needs to be pressed.
This means that any kid can touch it and make it happen, versus having to actually put real pressure (which is not necessarily easy if you're 2 years old).The volume isn't very high, but even if that's too much for you, there's always the ol' ""put clear tape over the speaker"" trick.The bottom of the bus has a few piano like keys, and the wheels are like cymbals when touched, so a potentially gifted 2 year old maestro can play a tune (or more realistically, hit the keys for nifty sounds).Overall, nice product."
I've bought and trusted Leapfrog products for years.
Not only are they fun and educational, but they are sturdy.
This is no exception.I love that this has 3 different modes.
It's not all about the obvious.
Learning with letters, numbers, colors, and motor skills.
Lights up and talks.
Has a game mode as well for when they age.
It's also very lightweight, and doesn't consume a ton of space.The only real downside I found was the voice operation can be a tad unclear at times.
Almost muffled.
That element was hit or miss.
"My daughter is 18 months and despite being a few months under the 2+ year target audience loves the sounds and music of the learning bus.
The letters have some of the common items which helps and she gets quite excited with the ones she recognizes.
I think the letter f and x would have been better to have a one word example but it works.The letters with the picture below each are:A=apple  B=bell  C=camera  D=duck  E=elephant  F=fire truck  G=gecko  H=hammer I=igloo J=jelly  K=kangaroo  L=lime  M= maracas  N=nut O=otter  P=popcorn Q=queen  R=robot  S=saw T=telephone  U=umbrella  V=vacuum  W=wave X=xray fish Y=yo-yo z=zipperThere are 3 modes of play:  explore and play, music, and games.
Each offers something different to keep your child occupied.My daughter likes to hear the letters like ""D as in Duck"" and then it quacks.
Plus the little keyboard at the bottom of the bus is a nice touch which has a cymbal for one wheel and a drum sound for the other.I think this is a great way to learn letters and a few words while having fun.
It's just one of those toys you do need to supervise so a child doesn't decide to stand or put something on top of it."
"My 18 month old twins love this toy, especially the music function.
Right now they are obsessed with ""dancing"" and love playing the different songs on the bus.
I like how there are three different functions so that you can switch between to keep the child(ren) from getting bored.
The toy is brightly colored and the usual gang of LeapFrog characters are riding the bus, so children will recognize their favorites.
I like how the surface is smooth and flat, which makes for easy cleaning when spills happen.
We have had toys ruined before when a sippy cup leaked on it and gummed up the buttons.
I was quickly able to wipe the bus off when an accident occured while one of the babies was dancing with a cup of Sunny Delight.
I do have to frequently remove the babies from the toy, as they treat it like a dance floor.
So far this has not been a problem, and the toy has not been damaged, but I'm not sure how much abuse it could take from toddlers, so I don't let them stand on it.
Overall, I am just as happy with this toy as I am my other LeapFrog products, it is fun and entertaining, and so far has been very durable.
I am happy with this, and will continue to add to our LeapFrog collection."
Once again my 3-yr-old granddaughter gets a new present to try.
This bus is quite a noisy one!
The voice speaks very clearly when saying the letter or the example use of a word beginning with the letter.
The piano is fun and loud!
There are lots of games kids can play with this so it keeps their attention going for a long time.
The toy is lightweight plastic so I'm not sure how durable it will be, but as long as you teach your children to take care of their toys (which you should be anyway!
)I think this bus should last a decent amount of time.
Educational, fun, and loud!
You can't go wrong, any child will love it!
My five-year-old twins love everything LeapFrog and this is no exception.
This is a great and fun way to learn the alphabet and it is big enough that the two of them can play with it at the same time.
And they have managed to drop it from several feet onto the hard floor and it survived that too without a scratch.
Unfortunately, the alphabet books we got them are not in the same pristine condition.
"Although this toy is rated for 2+, it is appropriate for much younger babies too.
My 12-month-old nephew loves this when he comes over for a playdate.
I don't know how much he absorbs when he presses the letters and hears the words, but this is one of his favorite toys.
He will sit and play with the keys and the letters for at least 10+ minutes.So if you're wondering if this will work with your 12 or 18 month old, go for it.That said, I don't think it's too babyish for 2 or 3 either.
It's very basic with broad appeal.
Nice bright ""buttons"" (they aren't actually raised) that sound music or words in a cheerful voice when you press them.
This makes a perfectly fine present for a 1 year old too, imo.
They will start to learn when they are ready, but won't be bored in the meantime either."
This one's a solid three on the musical toy scale.
The sound is a bit loud and not adjustable.
The actual tone is a little hard on the ears after 5 minutes or so.There are no buttons or dimensions to the product, it is totally flat and you just place the locations where the buttons are marked out in the graphic.
I found this led to the lack of interest in it from my two year old nephew.
Kids like to work buttons, levers dials, etc... this is not intuitive as to wear they should push besides the graphics.The toy is educational as you press the animals and they repeat the letters of the alphabet, and then you can play the little piano on the bottom.It wasn't sturdy though.
It's extremely lightweight and looks flimsy as if it would break pretty easily.
Not a bad toy, just not very interesting.
Everyone remembers the push button learning toys for kids.
And if you're a fan of Leap Frog you'll recall the previous generation this toy being a push button/light up bus toy.
Now the new fad is Touch-Screen / Touch Sensor hence the Touch Magic Learning Bus!
All you have to do is swipe your finger across any letter, color or musical instrument and it will react instantly.
You can switch between 3 different modes Learning, Letter Exploration and Music.
These modes include songs about the alphabet, motion and more.
I do usually adore leapfrog toys, however sometimes more techknowledgy doesn't make a better toy.
The Touch Magic bus no longer includes flashing lights, and it's also made of pretty thin plastic which is good for laptops but not for kids toys.
Overall it's an adorable kids toy and my little boy loves it.
Our granddaughter is a sharp cookie and can understand adult conversations, but like me - she's a late talker.
I had a toy similar to this growing up - and hearing letters and seeing them really helped me learn the sounds to the point it 'clicked' and my parents could finally understand me.
The toy is non-threatening as well.
After a certain age, a toddler gets tired of doing the endless feedback with an adult on sounding out the letters, etc.
It's both tedious and sometimes embarrassing or stressful.
Interacting with the toy is very relaxing because the child drives the 'lesson' so to speak.
The sounds are loud enough to hear, but not so loud that you want to confiscate the batteries.
All the buttons (including the power button) are activated by a gentle touch on the smooth surface - which is easy to clean with a damp cloth.
I'm not a big fan of toys that make noise for the sake of noise making - but this is a learning tool that feels like a toy.
"Today's youngsters are expected to have a basic set of skills and knowledge before entering first grade, or even kindergarten.
Letters, letter sounds, numbers, shapes,colors, and a basic vocabulary should all be part of the young learner's repertoire.
The Touch Magic Learning Bus gives little learners a head start on letters, letter sounds, and listening skills.In a fun format the little one learns to recognize letters and the sounds they make.
He or she also learns to recognize initial letter sounds of words representative of the letters.
Some of the word/letter matches are untraditional like: mararena for M, wave for W, lime for L, and otter for O.
Since I'm a vacuum cleaner fanatic, my favorite combo is vacuum for V.A youngster touching any of the letters is treated to the spoken letter, its sound, and the name of the representative picture.
There is a quiz mode during which kids are asked to identify specific letters or objects.
There's also a mode that allows the user to play music, listen to songs, and even add instrumentation to the songs.Learning Bus is large enough to display all the letters and sample object pictures, a six key keyboard and five musical animals.
At the same time it's light enough for small hands to hold and manipulate.
I like that all of the edges are rounded for safety.This Indonesian-made  learning tool is a worthwhile purchase, though I do have several quibbles.
The clarity of the spoken words on the unit could be better; instead it can be a little muffled at times.
In quiz mode, little ones are asked to identify individual letters or objects.
I wish the mode would also ask users to identify specific letter sounds.
For example the voice could make the ""b"" sound and ask the user to find the letter that makes that sound.
It would add another dimension to the toy.
Maybe I'm expecting too much for an instrument that's designed for those 2 and up.As much as I hate to admit it, Learning Bus has far more educational value and interest longevity than a Mr.
My 18 month old is too young for this, but we recently had a 2 and a half year old who played with it for about 15 minutes.
I think this is probably better for kids who are around 4 and up.It seems perfectly fun to me; it's got three differnet modes, with instructions on colors, instruments, and the alphabet.
If your child is just now learning the ABC's then this is helpful, but for the kids that I've had use it so far, it's too much for them.
I'll revisit this review as my child gets older.
"I lvoe playing with this with my 2 year old granddaughter and she loves it and carries it around with her.
It has a bright and pleasing look with lots of primary colors.
It uses animal pictures for the riders on the bus, and it has excellent sound quality.Pros:1) This has an absolutely flat surface and all the ""keys"" or ""buttons"" are touch sensitive.
This means that there is nothing to break off or get stuck on some other toy or piece of clothing.2) Because of the flat surface, this is very easy to clean and wipe down between uses or between multiple children.3) There is an on/off button to save batteries and an sound level button to lower the noise/sound level.4) Bright colors, capital letters of the sequential standard alphabet with pictures below each for vocabulary development, see/hear/say letter recognition.5) Announcer says the name of the item below the letters to aid in vocabulary development and well as the sound/letter.6) Multiple play levels: songs, games to find the letter OR find the item matching the letter.7) Musical keyboard with songs to play.
Wheels are interactive as well.8) Multiple instrument sounds with each character playing a different instrument so child can learn name of instrument and its sound.9) Game where child can interact with music/song by playing instruments with the song by repetitive touching of instruments.Con:Keyboard is limited to 6 instead of 8 notes and is not a sequential keyboard like most games.Overall, and excellent product children for ages 2 to 4, but even 18mos will enjoy this."
When I opened the package, I was immediately impressed with the bright and pleasing colors.
I also noticed the bus was very light and manageable for a pre-schooler.
All edges are rounded making the bus very safe for toddler use.
Knowing youngsters have lots of 'ickies,' the bus is very easy to clean and disinfect.As we began to use the bus, I was very pleased to hear that LeapFrog had chosen to use various words for their letter recognition that were 'outside of the box,' making the Magic Learning Bus unique.
I particularly like the three different modes which allow you to switch the emphasis from learning to FUN.
Certainly, the Identification/Recognition mode is educational; but the Game/Quiz mode adds a little more challenge to the learning.
Yet the Music Mode allows your child to either play along and learn or just dance.
Considering the size, weight and price of the product, the sound quality is better than expected.Once again, LeapFrog has not disappointed.
"The Touch Magic Bus continues the LeapFrog tradition of versatile, durable, quality toys that allow a child to learn while they think they're just having fun.
One of the 3 ""learning modes"" has a child identify letters & the sounds they make.
The music mode allows a child to play along with several songs.
There are 7-8 instruments represented.
A child can also choose to just dance to the music.
The game mode asks questions.
The child touches a letter or object on the Magic Bus to answer the question.
My 2-year old granddaughter LOVES this toy!
Its the only toy she's played with since it arrived 3 days ago.
A nice feature is that there are 2 volume settings.
Even though ""blast"" is her favorite volume level, there is a much quieter level as well.
The only thing I would change about the toy is to add some sort of retractable handle.
The toy is light enough for a young child to carry, but it's rather large for small hands to carry it conveniently."
