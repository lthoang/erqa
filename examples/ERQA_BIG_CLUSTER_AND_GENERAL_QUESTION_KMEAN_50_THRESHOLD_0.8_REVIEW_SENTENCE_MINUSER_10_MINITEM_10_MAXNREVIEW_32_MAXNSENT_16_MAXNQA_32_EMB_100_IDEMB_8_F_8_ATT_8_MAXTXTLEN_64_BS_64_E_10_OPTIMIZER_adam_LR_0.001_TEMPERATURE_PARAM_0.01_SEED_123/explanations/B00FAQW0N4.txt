Top sentence(s):
The only part the kids play with now is the rather nice big wheeled car that comes with the set.Overall it's a one trick pony that doesn't even do the one trick very well.
Then, he tried a couple more times with other trucks with no success.
He's frequently falling over.
My son however seems quite happy although I do think  that this toy will quickly lose its appeal if it doesn't start exploding a little more.
We've been told that there's been some imaginative playing with the Max-D Monster, with many other ways to make him explode than merely the Hot Wheels' track.One star removed for it's limited action, but overall, the Hot Wheels Monster Jam was a successful gift.Recommended!

Reviews:
My 6 year son offered me this review directly, so you know its kid approved :)+Like how the car can explode the monster guyLike the monster truck - my son's favorite part-Track doesn't stay together too well (we will probably tape it as it keeps pulling apart).My additional comments:* The robot (Max-D) at the end of the track is pretty cool, and when it explodes it's a nice show.
It only blows up once every 5 times or so, but my son now understands that's part of launching the truck properly if you want to see it blow up.
Like other Hot Wheels toys, 100% reliability isn't part of the show (cars fall off tracks, mis launches happen, etc.
)* The amazon.com page has a confusing &#34;Track Builder&#34; link on it.
We have Track Builder sets, and while you could theoretically connect this set to them, it wouldn't do much of anything (the Monster Truck is twice as big, and most of the other tracks are not side by sides).
I wouldn't think of this as Track Builder compatible.. Hopefully they will take that part down.Still ,overall, a great toy for monster truck and Hot Wheels fans.
I love hot wheels but this set is just a mess, poorly planned and really with no purpose.First off, the goal is to shoot with the power pusher and shoot the monster truck towards the robot, which can spin and try and defend the attack.
The truck goes up a jump and aims for the collapsible truck and box that it comes with.The first thing is, you really need two kids to play this: one to shoot the car and one to move the robot around.
With two kids, one can try and make the robot spin or it can collapse with a good hit.
With one kid, they have to be able to reach both sides and it is awkward.The inherent problem is:  noise.
It is pure noise, banging and hard plastic hitting hard plastic.
Sure, I have a 7 year old and I've had older kids (I should be used to noise!!
), but the noise level is through the roof.
Also, the time that two kids played it was short, they moved on to their Hot Wheels regular track set (the starter set with accessories added).
In fact, they took pieces from this and used them in other games.
Currently the robot has his top half off and is stuck in the toybox.
Not of long term interest to my kid.Another note: this is a stand alone set, it doesn't hook up to other Hot Wheels track systems, further marginalizing it's usage.
I'd spend the money on the regular Hot Wheels sets that interconnect.
I have to say this toy did not go over well with my kids.
From my point of view, it is very one dimensional.
There is just one layout, just one way to use this.
For me, a far better toy would allow creativity in setup and play.
I loved my hot wheels track as a kid, but this just doesn't lend itself to any creative reconfiguring of the track.For my kids, they found slamming on the launcher painful and less than effective.
The trigger to make the robot explode was too stiff for the truck to actual set off when launched and after a few attempts it was abandoned.
Within 15 minutes, both had said &#34;Meh,&#34; and went back to other toys.Pros+ The Monster Truck is OK.Cons- Kind of a waste of plastic- Cannot be reconfigured- Limited functionality (slam and set truck off on 14 inch run.- Trigger button not sensitive enough for the car to strike and set off.- Kids did not like it.Summary.This was a disappointing product both to me and my kids.
Try out bigger sets with lots of track and the ability to creatively reconfigure you track.
Like many plastic toys with my boys it didn't last very long.
They did assemble it by themselves which is amazing since they are 7,5, and 3.
So easily assembly, and fun car does work, but kids attention for it was short and the pieces easily got disconnected and lost.
For what its worth it was fun, but I wouldn't pay for this.
My sons absolutely love the Hot Wheels Monster Jam series.
We have several of the Monster Jam vehicles.
My sons were so excited to get the Hot Wheels Monster Jam Maximum Destruction Battle.
I thought that it would come with &#8220;Maximum Destruction&#8221; as the vehicle because of the name but the vehicle included is &#8220;Hot Wheels&#8221;.
I think in this game, the name comes from the detachable figure which is &#8220;Max-D&#8221;.In the past we have had a few Hot Wheels sets that did not set up well or work well once you had them set up but this set is pretty straight forward and simple so they didn't have any trouble with set-up or operation.They loved playing with the set and getting a new truck to add to their collection.
They really liked the Max-D figure too.
I have given it 4 stars for my kids as they seem happy with it.
As with most Monster Jam toys we have got durability and craftsmanship are not at its highest level.
The track and robot are plastic.
Putting it together was not hard.
Clip and snap with lots of stickers and you are all set to play.
The set does come with the hot wheels monster truck.
Now having had several track sets we have several of the same monster trucks.
I do wish it was different but that I can live with.
I have to say that for myself I am disappointed about the ability of exploding the robot.
Me and my son flew the car down the tracks several times and only managed to get the whole robot to explode once.
We have managed to get the head to come off twice.
I really wish it would happen more often.
My son however seems quite happy although I do think  that this toy will quickly lose its appeal if it doesn't start exploding a little more.
As far as cheap, plastic toys go, this one isn't too bad.
It assembles easily.
Playing with it is straightforward and easy to figure out.
The monster is well-constructed and snaps together well.
The truck is also very sturdy.
However, the track is cheap and has a tendency to get detached from the monster base.The goal is to get the truck to jump off the ramp and hit the monster's chest which causes the monster to break apart.
I tried many times but couldn't get the truck to jump high enough.
Regardless, my toddlers had some fun launching the truck along the track and spinning the monster.A nice thing about this toy is you can ditch the track and just play with the monster and truck as independent pieces.This is toy that will likely keep kids busy for a short while.
Just don't expect much more than that because it won't take long for kids to bore of it or break it.
My son has several of these Hot Wheels toys that involve shooting monster truck and he seems to really enjoy them.
They are easy to put together although in my opinion are not the best made toys on the market.
The tracks do not stay put and all of the hot wheels tracks and toys like this are plastic and flimsy.
The car itself it a well made die cast Hot Wheel so no complaints there.
It shoots the car at the robot at the end and for my five year old that is all it takes for a good time!
My two boys love playing with their Hot Wheels and I thought they would enjoy this since it's a giant robot.
The track is what you can usually expect from Hot Wheels--it includes 2 pieces of track, a launcher, ramp and robot.
The goal is to launch your hot wheels into the chest plate of the robot, so he pops apart.
It's very difficult to hit him in the sweet spot however, and the boys got bored quickly.
If you're a Hot Wheels enthusiast and set this up with other playsets, it's great, but on it's own, not so much.
This is a great addition to any track set and my nephew absolutely adored this!
It's kept him busy for days!
I expected some good old &#8220;American boy fun&#8221; from Hot Wheels Monster Jam Maximum Destruction Battle Trackset.
Mattel pitted a Hot Wheels &#8220;monster truck against&#8221; a claw welding monster robot.
This is not your daddy&#8217;s Hot Wheels.
The enormous wheels make it hard for the toy truck to stay on track.
It is also difficult to generate enough force to knock the gargantuan robot over, which is the goal.
The toy set was built relatively well by today&#8217;s standards, but that is not saying much.
The monster worked but the pieces of track seemed to come apart fairly easily and interrupting the fun of playing with the set.
The concept of being able to add more track and other Monster trucks to the set is intriguing, but I think it is a way to trap parents into going out and spending more of their hard earned money on more sets.
I don&#8217;t think this toy is worth the money&#8230;.
I have a 7 year old son who is no lightweight.
He loves to put together legos and crash monster trucks.
He ripped open this box and immediately started putting together this set himself.
With just a little help and some sticker placement guidance, he had the whole thing complete in about 15 minutes.He was so excited to crash the trucks.
He used the one included but couldn't get it launched with enough power to hit the monster.
Then, he tried a couple more times with other trucks with no success.
He had a friend over who, in the 30 times they smacked the darn lever, only made hit the monster hard enough to pop him apart once.
ONE TIME!
What's the fun in that?
Even his father and I tried with little success.I like the idea of the set.
I like that you can add on more tracks.
But the fact that you can't get it to launch far enough to do what it is supposed to makes me sad for my kid.
There's two things that should make this set awesome: monster trucks and a giant robot.
Combining the two so that the monster truck attacks the giant robot should be icing on the cake.
Unfortunately, it isn't quite as tasty a cake as it could be.For one, this is part of the Track Builder Hot Wheels set, but it's not entirely compatible.
Oh sure, you could connect other sets to this one, but it becomes apparent that the killer robot known as Max-D is no slouch.
In essence, the monster truck is so large that its wheels fill up an entire track, taking up the space of two cars.
The truck is manually launched with a lever that fires it towards Max-D, who is made up of three pieces: a pair of legs, a torso with two claw arms that can hold a car in each hand, and a head.
All three of these separate if the chest plate is hit hard enough, separating Max-D in a satisfying spring-loaded explosion of robo-body parts.
The key is &#34;hard enough.&#34;Never mind that if you connected this set to the other sets, the cars don't have enough mass to trigger Max-D.
They also rarely hit him in the right place.
But that wouldn't be a problem if at least the monster truck triggered the explosion -- it doesn't.
My six-year-old couldn't ever get it to work after multiple tries, and it took me another 12 attempts before I was able to hit Max-D where it hurts.
In short, there's not much in the way of &#34;maximum destruction.&#34;The other problem is that Max-D doesn't sit well on his dirt-platform.
He's frequently falling over.
My kids were eager to play with him, but quickly discovered that punching him in the chest plate hurts.
Max-D's legs don't move, so he pretty much sits there.
The claw-grasping action is cool, but the two flimsy props (a crunched up bus and a dumpster) are poor substitutes for other cars in his fists.Max-D and the monster truck are fun separately, but their collision is less exciting than the promise on the box.
My grandsons, seven and nine, both enjoyed this&#8212;for a while.
The older boy was in charge of launching the truck, while his younger brother took charge of the robot.
They managed to get the robot to explode with a satisfying loud noise, but lost interest eventually.
They've gone back to it since, but it's a standalone toy, and doesn't keep them interested for the long haul.
So we give three stars.
And if you have a nine-year-old boy, this is what he wants to play with--I highly recommend it along with other Hot Wheels tracksets such as the Hot Wheels T-Rex Takedown Playset.
No frills and no excuses--just a hot wheels truck and the robot that wants to crush it.
What more could a nine-year-old boy want?
This is a very cool toy for little boys, but it won't last long.
Parts are lightweight and notsturdy.
More like a Christmas toy you play with on Christmas and then it goes away.
Also dosn't lastthrough a short attention span.
This track is great for younger children especially.
My boys are a bit older and they enjoy playing with it but the track lost its luster quickly with them.
My youngest boy loved it.
He played with over and over again.The track is durable while made of plastic.
The robot (monster?)
is easy to put together even for smaller children.
The monster will break quickly but I was happy that it didn't just break as soon as a car (or truck) ran into it.My only reasons for not giving this a five star would be that my older boys lost interest fast and there is not much of a point to the track itself other than destroying the monster.
It needs to be included with other tracks.
I got this toy for my grandkids (3 & 5)  to play with.
It does require a few minutes of set up that needs to be done by an adult such as putting the stickers on the parts and building the robot, but it's pretty simple.
The only problem I had was the numbers identifying the stickers were so tiny I had a lot of trouble seeing them.The set comes with a truck to launch at the robot, and a plastic motorhome and a dumpster that the robot holds in his claws.
After we set it up, we tried over and over to get the truck to smash Max D's breastplate and cause him to break apart, but couldn't make it work.
I decided to substitute a 4 wheeler toy that was about the same size as the truck the set came with, but it was also a little bit lighter.
Worked like a charm.
They bashed that poor robot to pieces over and over.
However, they soon lost interest as that is the only thing you can do with this set.
My grandson ended up playing with the truck and my granddaughter enjoyed playing with the robot.I think the Max D Battle Trackset is a good idea that doesn't quite come together.
I think I would prefer to buy a Hot Wheels set that is a little more versatile.
This is one of those one gimmick toys that winds up being really neat for all of a few minutes until the kids figure out it only does one thing, and it doesn't even do that all that well.
Ostensibly, it should be possible to launch the big wheeler with enough force down the track to hit the &#34;menacing&#34; robot right in the chest and &#34;break&#34; him into pieces.
Once this was all put together, it became obvious that neither my 3 year old or my 5 year old had the physical strength and skill to launch the car far enough and it was up to us parents to do it for them.
Still, they had fun for a little while driving the car into the robot to break him apart.Since then I haven't seen them even want to play with it, and I've wound up tripping over the track several times--it's smaller than some toys, which is a blessing , but it's still a pain to store.
The only part the kids play with now is the rather nice big wheeled car that comes with the set.Overall it's a one trick pony that doesn't even do the one trick very well.
The car is the best part, but just buy your kids  a really nice hotwheels car rather than investing in the rest of the plastic frippery.Happy Playing!

Note: this review is from grandparents acquiring gifts for 3 and 5-yr-old grandkids, often to be shipped over distance.
I rate toys for &#34;gift impact,&#34; measured by the youngsters' excitement and (reported) response.
If you're another grandparent or any friend/family, we'd like to help you buy something for a child not-your-own to order on Amazon and have delivered.
Gift wrap is a great idea, and you get to write a card to go with it.If it's a boy you're buying for, one who is already into Hot Wheels, this is a no-brainer!
It combines the perennially popular Hot Wheels cars, with a Transformer-style monster.
The box is going to make a splash to begin with: it is 15 inches across, by about a foot high, by 3 inches deep.
The front shows an action painting of the Max-D monster, and the see-through window displays the Hot Wheels off-road Monster Jam truck -- a flame painted jumped up pickup on oversize tires.Our favorite little monster found this to be right up his alley!
It's a (probably) politically incorrect &#34;Maximum Destruction Battle&#34; right out of the box.
(By the way, he is three, and the box says &#34;4+&#34; because of the choking hazard of small parts, but our grandchild has been safe with such things for a long time now).The Monster Max-D has claws and spins around.
He can block the truck that comes-with (and any other small Hot Wheels-like car) that is launched at it.
The recipient of our gift, with minimal adult help, was able to put the thing together and stick on the stickers in a few minutes.
Some reviewers have complained that Max doesn't blow apart on every hit, but we're told that wasn't a problem for our boy.We're told as well that there was a problem keeping the track together, but tape solved that.
Also, that this is a &#34;one act&#34; toy.
You launch the car at Max-D and you either hit his chest and he pops apart -- or not.However, we're not so sold on toys having to either last forever.
Like most toys, there's an intense period of getting to know it, and then it goes in a box with the rest of the things for occasional use.
We've been told that there's been some imaginative playing with the Max-D Monster, with many other ways to make him explode than merely the Hot Wheels' track.One star removed for it's limited action, but overall, the Hot Wheels Monster Jam was a successful gift.Recommended!
