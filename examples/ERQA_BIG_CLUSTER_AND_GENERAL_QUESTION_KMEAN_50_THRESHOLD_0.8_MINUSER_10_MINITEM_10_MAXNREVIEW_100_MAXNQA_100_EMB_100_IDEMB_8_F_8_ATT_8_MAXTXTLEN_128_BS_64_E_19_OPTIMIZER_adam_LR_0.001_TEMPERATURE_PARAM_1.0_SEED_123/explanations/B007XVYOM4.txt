"So, ck_361 has a nice review on here that compares and contrasts feature by feature.  What I will tell you about is the difference in impressions I've had with using this toy versus the LeapPad2. The bottom line is that I would choose the LeapPad2 over this product. Below are a few more details.First of all, all of these products require setup time and I found the InnoTab to take more time.  You don't just take it out of the box and instantly use it. This is a one time activity, but when your kids are excited to use it and then they stand there trying to be patient (or not so patient) it is a little annoying when it takes a long time to setup.  The Innotab was easily an hour of setup time.  For both products, you unbox it (which is a chore itself), turn it on, set up a profile, install software on your computer, watch while the software upgrades itself, and then choose a few free games to add to it which it downloads. I just found the InnoTab to be a lengthier process than the LeapPad (although the LeapPad is tedious as well).Next, once you get it going, the child will start clicking around and playing with the toy.  The innotab seems very sluggish to me.  I'm not expecting iPad speed here, but it just gives the impression of being sluggish which the kids also notice and is frustrating for them.One of the skills I wanted to teach my kids was writing letters.  So, we waded through the ""free"" apps, and found a few worth using our credit on.  We found that the screen wasn't very accurate in these games and it just frustrated our kids because it kept insisting that they weren't doing it right.  Even when I tried it, it didn't work very well. Maybe other apps are better at the stylus recognition, but I have my doubts.Of note, both the LeapPad and Innotab have a wide array of available apps.So, finally, why am I really recommending the LeapPad? Although My kids will play with both of them and they are both very fun products, my kids fight over who gets the LeapPad and the InnoTab takes second place... I guess the proof is in the pudding."

Reviews:
"I was impressed with the VTech's original Innotab because its common sense factor offset any shortcomings (when compared to its competitor, the LeapPad).  The INNOTAB2 adequately addresses most all of the issues associated with its predecessor and presents itself as a more refined product with some ""outside the box"" add-ons that really make it shine.For the second straight year, VTech and LeapFrog will present families with choice of a children's tablet computer for the holidays:  the INNOTAB2 and the LeapPad2.  Honestly, they are both great products and I feel they complement rather than rival one another.  But, if given the choice between the second generation of these tablets, I would choose the INNOTAB2 because LeapFrog seems geared towards creating an iPad for kids whereas VTech's approach is to simply offer a kid's tablet ... the design between the two sets them apart more than anything.  The INNOTAB2 is a fully functional tablet device that is designed to appeal to kids and more importantly, handle all the toy abuse a typical kid delivers.Structurally, the INNOTAB2 is more refined and rugged than the original.  By trimming the sides a little and making it somewhat thicker; the tablet grips more solidly, like a book rather than a magazine.  The contoured rubber-bumper corners also feel more protective than those on the Innotab.  The tablet comes with a stylus that again slides and snaps into the side.  The stylus has been changed so that it is thicker with no pointed tip (like a crayon) and a backup stylus is included.  A bar on the tablet offers a stylus tether option, but oddly, no tether was included.  The INNOTAB2 includes an add-on cartridge that snaps to a slot on the side of the tablet.  I liked the way the add-on cartridge is designed to snap flush with the side of the tablet and not protrude in any manner (another kid-proof feature).  Other design aspects include a battery compartment with a smaller slide bar for access, rubber knobs underneath to prevent any scratching when placed flat on a table and, like the original, a solid plastic stand is integrated into the back of the case.The ""guts' of the INNOTAB2 include 2GB of on-board memory (something that was missing in the original Innotab) with the capability of accommodating an external memory card of up to 32 GB ... more than enough.  The processing speed at start-up is a little sluggish/slow, but the applications run smoothly.  The lack of a camera on the original has also been addressed as the INNOTAB2 has a camera at the top with a lens that can be uniquely ""rolled"" to face the front or back for pictures and video.  Button controls on the surface include:  ""on/off"", ""home"", volume control and the camera.  A ""?"" button triggers a quick and convenient ""help"" function.  Software and a USB cable are included to allow computer/internet access.  I found VTech's website a little cumbersome to navigate but eventually managed to download some programs to the tablet (the INNOTAB2 can accommodate any programs downloaded for the original Innotab, as well).  VTech's Learning Lodge Navigator offers considerably more options now and the add-on cartridges include Dora, Hello Kitty, Disney, etc.  The graphics, especially for a kid's toy, are surprisingly good.Overall, I like the INNOTAB2 and all the improvements it includes.  My only issue is that VTech will soon be rolling out a Wi-Fi version of this product, called the Innotab2S ..."
"This second-gen InnoTab features a 5-inch screen and a built-in camera that swivels 180 degrees, perfect for kids under 7 or 8! The ""tablet"" itself is built to withstand rough handling and many a drop, so a parent like myself can hand it to the kids and not worry about breaking an expensive tablet. InnoTab2 comes with three free downloads. The games, whether downloaded or on a cartridge, are more educational than the apps you find for the regular tablets, and mostly appropriate for the Innotab's target age group, 3-8. However, the cartridge apps are really expensive, and the download apps could be a little cheaper, too."
"First of all, let me say that I like Vtech's products. In general, they make educational toys/books/etc that my children have benefited from. The InnoTab 2 delivers this as well. Without looking at the instructions (could be dangerous right) I handed it to my kids to test. They had it up and running, playing games, reading books, toying with the video feature before I even looked at it. By the way, THEY give it five stars. The only downfall of the product that I see, and this has been related by others, is that it eats batteries. However, overall my kids are having fun with the toy. I tested its included apps and found them to be intuitive and simple enough for young minds. This is a great ""toy"" and I will likely purchase more ebooks and apps to go along with it. five stars."
"I've now owned (at the time of this review), a Leapfrog Leapster 2, Leapfrog Leapster GS Explorer, Vinci 7"" Mobile Learning System, and now this, the Vtech Innotab.  Of all of them, this is the nicest.  The Leapster 2 is now a bit out of date; the GS is very nice and not quite as big as this Innotab: I prefer the additional screen real estate more than compact size, but otherwise the Lapfrog offerings are just as good if not better (in general) than Vtech.  The Vinci is unbelievable build quality, but not nearly worth the price of admission in terms of educational value: you just don't get as much out of the box.OK, what I like about the Innotab... the drawing program is exceptionally well done; a child can easily draw entire landscapes using the simple, self-explanatory tools.  The tools include frogs that will hop across the page leaving tracks, cars that will do the same, myriad ""pencils"" that will draw grass, stars, butterflies, you-name-it, for you.  All sorts of shapes, etc.  So a small child doesn't have to rely on actual drawing skill.  For that, there are also paintbrushes and pencils.  All in all the drawing program is great.  And it's included free.  Games... kids love 'em, some simple free ones are included either in the cartridge or by registering where you receive two additional downloads.  No complaints.  The website is almost identical to Leapfrog's so no real leader there.It's splitting hairs trying to place this above Leapfrog offerings, but here goes: it's less expensive, has a slightly larger screen, has the kickstand, more specifically advertises the ereader functionality, and the drawing program is better; Otherwise generally the Leapfrog has more titles and probably slightly better games.  But not by much.  Overall I'm very impressed with it, and would buy one in a heartbeat, knowing what I now know about it.Pros:- wide range of uses (ereading, games of many varieties, music, drawing- decent quality- great price- extra stylus includedCons:- no AC included; must run on batteries or buy one- it must be said: unpacking this thing from the overly-childproofed box was so annoying that it's going in as a ""con""!"
We have the first gen as well as the Innotab 2 and like both.  There's not a huge difference, but the subtle adjustments in the new version are definitely improvements.  I like a company that tweaks a product to make it more user-friendly for both kids and parents.  Definitely buy the AC adapter for power.  It chews up batteries too fast for it to be a great mobile device.  Worth doing for a car trip but for around the house use, the adapter will save a lot of money.  We have Mobigos as well as the Innotabs and all are enjoyed.  They are unique enough to have both types of devices.
I actually thought I had ordered a Furby but I got this instead so I let my grandson play with this and I was amazed at how fast he caught on to it. He was having so much fun with it that when his parents came back to get him he didn't want to go home. This has an ereader, camera, video, games and an art studio. He has the leapfrogpad2 but this actually has more to the art studio. He likes it better. He also loves the games downloaded on it. He's very good at figuring out how to play. He was playing face race and figured out he had to tilt the game and he was beating everyone elses scores.
"HOW ARE LEAPPAD2 AND INNOTAB2 THE SAME?- Both have the same screen size (2 "" x 4 ""), or 5"" if you're measuring diagonally.- Both require 4 AA batteries (not included).- Both use a stylus.- Both have a cartridge port for additional games, and uses purchased apps.- Both have an age requirement of 3-9 years. VTech's Amazon page says 4-9 years, but the box and VTech's website state 3-9 years.- Both have a camera.- Both have additional accessories you can buy like gel skins, cases, rechargeable batteries, ac adapters, and headphones. UPDATE: the InnoTab doesn't have a gel skin accessory, just a screen guard you can purchase. LeapPad you can purchase both separately.- Both can be personalize for up to 4 players.- Both have eReaders, MP3 Players (InnoTab's is free, LeapPad's is an additional $3.75 through their App store), art studio, and most of your basic themed books and games.- Both have a mic and volume control.- Some people like to creatively take the tablets out of the box for setup before handing to a child as a gift. LeapPad2 was a bit difficult, but doable. The InnoTab2 is a bit more of a challenge; just use sharp scissors to break the tape and fold out the box carefully.- Both have a parent tracker that allows parents to track their child's progress and success playing a game.HOW ARE LEAPPAD2 AND INNOTAB2 DIFFERENT?- The LeapPad2 is smaller. Actually it looks like with InnoTab2 they were the same size, but they surrounded it with an additional "" layer of decorative plastic with rubber corners to help protect it from a fall. For small hands I find it cumbersome. Plus it makes the screen appear smaller. But I do like the rubber corners.- The LeapPad2 has a front and back camera, but the InnoTab2 has only one camera that rotates (creative idea!)- The battery compartment on the InnoTab is easily accessible. Just slide a switch and it opens the compartment. I prefer LeapPad's more secure sliding feature. But if you're using a gel skin on either that helps prevent access.- The LeapPad2 only comes with one stylus, the InnoTab2 comes with two; always a plus in case you loose or break one. The InnoTab2 uses a secure rope loop but I looked everywhere in the packaging and there wasn't one! Also, InnoTab's stylus is pure plastic, flat, and slippery. LeapPad2's stylus is what you're more used to seeing (round like a pencil), and not slippery to hold.- LeapPad2 has 4GB of memory, InnoTab2 2GB... but, you can use an SD card to add an additional 32GB of memory. That's impressive! (SD card not included). I am finding that 2 or 4GB of memory is more than enough for our needs.- LeapPad2 I had to setup using their installation CD before I could play it, but the InnoTab2 you can start playing right away.- VTech has some interesting new apps that come with the InnoTab2 right out of the box, like a calculator app, calendar, notes, and clock. I don't know why, but I find that nice. I couldn't find those apps in LeapFrog's app store.- InnoTab2 has a tilt sensor like an iPad or iPhone and will tilt the screen if held horizontal or vertical. LeapPad2 does not have this feature. UPDATE: LeapPad2 does have this feature, but only with certain apps. For instance, the main screen (home screen with apps) does not tilt like the InnoTab2 will. The InnoTab2 will tilt with just about everything, but the LeapPad2 is limited to certain apps.- LeapPad2's store for purchasing apps is easily accessed. I went to their website and could browse their app selection right away. On VTech's website I couldn't find the app store to save my life. All I could find were the cartridges for sale, which are comparable to LeapFrog's prices.- InnoTab2 has buttons for brightening or dimming the screen, but don't expect much, there's only four bars and it doesn't make a lot of difference.- InnoTab2 has a ""?"" button that allows you to hear instructions again, or find out more information about an app (nice touch!).- InnoTab2 comes with a manual. LeapPad2 does not.- InnoTab2 you can upload your own videos and pictures (supports JPEG formatted photos, and MJPEG/H.264 videos (avi)). You'll need to convert your videos for use. Quality isn't like an iPad or iPhone, but little kids won't mind. Transferring videos and music is quick and easy. LeapPad2 doesn't have this ability, you can only download/purchase videos from their website to watch.- InnoTab2 has a ""kickstand"" for standing the tablet up vertically or horizontal.So what's the overall review?Honestly, I feel the InnoTab2 is just what the original LeapPad was: s-l-o-w. InnoTab2 takes 37 seconds to reach the app home screen. LeapPad2 takes 21 seconds. With LeapPad2 it takes almost 5 seconds from the time you select an app for it to start. It takes InnoTab2 almost 8 seconds. It just feels like there's a lot of ""loading"" going on with the InnoTab2. I'm nit picking of course, but it makes a difference to me.Also, my son just turned 3. When he tries to swipe the screen to the next page he sometimes touches an app, which causes it to load. He then has to wait for it to load before he can go back to the Home screen and try and swipe again. This happened to me a lot, too. If I lay my finger down for just a fraction of a second the InnoTab2 thinks I'm selecting an app instead of swiping. So you have to be careful to swipe in an empty space; my 3 year old isn't capable of that when the screen is filled with apps. The LeapPad2 just uses arrows to touch at the bottom of the screen.Overall I feel the InnoTab2 is really not geared for 3 year olds (just like the original LeapPad wasn't either). The screen isn't as bright and crisp as the LeapPad2, and the tablet doesn't feel as solid in my hands.LeapPad2 is currently $20 more; I'd really suggest getting a LeapPad2 over an InnoTab2, especially if you have a 3 year old: Older kids probably not that big of a deal, just a matter of preference. The included apps seem geared toward older kids anyway, whereas LeapPad2 apps are more 3 year old friendly with their PetPad tracing alphabet game, and the overall designs of the included apps more basic. For example, the art studio in InnoTab2 has like a million color choices, but LeapPad2 just has basic colors to choose from.InnoTab2 is compatible with LeapPad2 in education, but I feel like the tablet needs more work."
