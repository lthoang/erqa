Top question:
I see other klip klop characters sol separately with a ramp.  Does the other ramp that you can buy with another character connect to this?
Top review:
I was excited about this product because it's the perfect compliment to the Disney Princess Songs Castle that my 15 month old loves, but I quickly became disappointed with it and my daughter became very bored with it's limitations. On the positive side, the stable was relatively easy to put together and only required a screwdriver for one piece and the rest snapped together. It's made of durable plastic and is very cutely decorated and comes with 2 horses/princesses (Aurora and Rapunzel). My daughter does love watching the horses klip klop down the ramps, but becomes frustrated with the fact that the horses legs get stuck in the ridges of the ramp and the fact that on the ramp there's a slide and the horses get stuck in that too.There really isn't much play option value in this other than the turn table that plays music while the horses sit on it and the horses (sorta) klopping down the ramps. The box boasts of music and lights but the only music that plays is at the front door slide and on the turn table. My biggest issue with it is that it's bulky and if you want to play with the turn table, you have to turn the entire monstrosity around and if you want to play with the slide you have to turn the whole thing around again. I think the price (about $40) is way too high for the limited amount of play options and that the cost of buying one additional horse/princess is also too high ($10). Yes watching the horse klop down is fun and cute for a while, but that's where the amusement ends. If you're looking for a versatile and fun Disney princess product, I recommend going withFisher-Price Little People Disney Princess Songs Palace. This is way more fun and the princesses talk/sing and my daughter loves it. This stable toy is just not up to par.

Reviews:
Although this Disney princess toy set takes up a lot of space, it's very cute. This set comes with Aurora and Rapunzel figures, which is a good introduction of these princesses to my 23 month old daughter, who is most familiar with Ariel and Belle. She loves the horse trot sound effects and the music. The only cons are that the slides don't connect to each other and sometimes the horses don't slide as smoothly as you would expect. This may or may not be a problem for your child, depending on their personality. My daughter doesn't seem to get frustrated with it. She really enjoys this toy it keeps her entertained for extended periods of time.
"My daughter is a bit younger than the recommended age range for this set (12 months as opposed to 18 months).  Of course, her playtime is always well supervised, and I did not feel that this toy was in any way a danger.  The pieces are large, and it's very engaging even for someone so young.  Although she's at that stage where she wants to be constantly in motion, this Klip Klop Stable set from Fisher-Price actually prompted her to sit down and play for an extended period (and even longer when I sat with her and played alongside her).Because her older sister (five years) is a big fan of Disney Princesses, this playset fit right in with our other toys.  My five-year-old expressed limited interest in the stable set on her own (she prefers dolls that she can dress up), but what this toy did accomplish was quite amazing.  Because my older daughter loves princesses, this playset allowed her the chance to calmly play with her younger sister with something that was interesting and somewhat engaging for both of them.  I've long been looking for a toy that both girls could enjoy, or at least something that would interest the older girl in playing with her younger sibling.  In that respect, this Klip Klop Stable was a great success and a popular addition to the girls' room.My younger daughter likes the sounds that the horses make and mainly just likes holding the pieces and moving them around a little, while her older sister simply likes horses and princesses, making this set ""cool"" just on the surface.  It's really a nice combination of elements to engage a fairly wide age range for young girls.  As it happens, Rapunzel is my older daughter's favorite princess of the moment, and she was thrilled that this set came with her included (along with Aurora who is not as popular or as recognizable in our house).  Of course, in a perfect world the most popular princesses - Ariel and Belle - would be included as well, but at least they're available separately in case we absolutely need to have them (which will probably be the case if this remains a popular toy for the next month or two).Essentially, if you have a girl - or a couple of girls - between the ages of 1 and 5, there's a lot to like about this set.  And it might even encourage your kids to play together, which is a definite plus."
My kids have been having some fun with this.  The ponies trot down the ramps pretty weel, though it's a little fiddly for my 4-year-olds.  Younger kids might get frustrated getting the ponies to cooperate.  My daughter was happy to recognize the princesses and the little familiar items from various movies on the walls of the tower.
My daughter and niece LOVE our Little People Princess Castle, so I thought the Klip Klop Stable was sure to be a hit with them too. Unfortunately, it just hasn't been as much fun as expected.Though this is a large, pretty playset, with cutely decorated rooms and pictures of princesses everywhere, there's really only one interesting thing to DO with it, and that's to send Rapunzel and Aurora and their horses Klip Klopping down the ramps over and over again. The rocking movement of the horses is definitely fascinating and entrancing, and the girls like it, but it can only hold their interest for a couple of minutes before they move on to a toy that gives their imaginations a little more room to soar. I was also disappointed to find that Ariel, Cinderella, and Belle's horses, which are sold separately, cost around $7 a piece, making it very pricey indeed to fill the stable with princesses.If this were a true Little People toy, with Little People Princesses that could come off their horses, jump over the fence, and visit their castle, this would have been the perfect addition to our Little People kingdom. As it is, it's cute, but sits mostly neglected.
I have a 7,5,3, and almost 1 year old and all of them were fighting over it when I first opened it. Seems it's for all ages, ha! It was easy to assemble and I believe only had three small screws. It's beautiful and my youngest daughter LOVED it! The way the horse magnetically trots down the stairs is amazing and the kids are WOWed by it. I would highly recommend this for creative and imaginative play!
"This has been a big hit with my kids and their cousins.  While clearly aimed at the toddler set, the older kids like to take a turn with it too.  The main thing you'll notice is that like most ""Little People"" toys it is sturdy, simple, and free of all the little bits you worry about small kids swallowing.  As a ""Princess Castle"" it works just fine.  My daughters are not really clued into the whole Princess thing yet but they enjoy sliding things down the ramp.  The older kids tend to pull out their own action figures and it's been everything from a Princess Castle to the scene of a light-saber duel.  The slide doesn't work all that well but the kids have a good time anyway.  It's a good solid toy with plenty of room for imaginary play.It takes just a few minutes to assemble.  I always hate putting the stickers on, but beyond that it's a breeze.  I've currently got the batteries in and it's not to bothersome.  That being said when these batteries die I'm not sure I'll replace them.  I find the kids are happy to supply their own sound effects which is much less annoying."
I bought this for my niece...what a great toy and for her upcoming year I can just buy her more princess/horses...works great and easy to put together
"I had to laugh listening to the ""klip, klop"" noises of the horse's hoofs as it trots along the ramp from one destination to another in Fisher-Price's ""Little People Disney Princess Klip Klop Stable Toy"" created for girls age 3-5.All the child has to do is place the horse on a ramp and Ala-Kazam! the horse automatically begins klip-klopping on the ramp. What fun! There are two ramps the child can choose for the horse - one to a three-tiered tower complete with a library, kitchen and vanity or to the Royal Stable with a balcony overlooking the grounds.The stable has two stalls and when you open the doors of one the horse magically comes klopping out, or is it klipping out? The courtyard has a dance floor where the child can have the Princess Aurora dance, maybe even with her horse (if horses can dance). Included in the set is Rapunzel riding Maximus.  There also is a small turntable that turns and plays music when the horse is placed on it.When first used, the horses may fall off the ramp so the child has to learn to carefully place the horse in position. The play set once assembled is quite big and does not fold up to put away between playtimes. All in all, though, this is a fun toy for little girls."
This Fisher-Price Little People Disney Princess Stable toy is a lot of fun! The little horses/princesses are really adorable, and they really do move on their own down the sloped ramps! It is so much fun. I love all the little decals that make this set come to life (which include lots of pictures from the Disney princess movies.It does take a little time to assemble - figuring out just where everything goes, finding a screwdriver to put it together, buying the batteries it needs (yes you need to buy your own batteries!), etc. I just wish that it came with the other Disney princesses (which you can purchase separately). For such a cute and fun toy, there aren't many pieces that you can actually pick up and move around. More princesses would have been awesome.Overall this is a really fun toy!
"First, a complaint.  There are three separate blue ramps in this playset, each designed to interface with the ""feet"" of the included horses, so that the horse will ""rock"" its way down the ramp as though it were actually walking.  Super cute.  BUT, on the lowest of the three ramps, they have included a molded barrier across the middle of the ramp, rendering it useless.  This barrier is not visible in some of the product photographs, but is visible in others (compare the lowest ramp in the sixth and fourth photos above).  That's 33% of the horse-walking fun gone, right there.That egregious design flaw aside, this is a nice playset that my 27-month old enjoys playing with.  The two included horse/rider combinations (Rapunzel and Aurora) are among her favorite princesses, and despite having a very lego-man-vibe to them, she was able to recognize who they were (with some prompting).The two functional ramps are cleverly textured with horizontal ribbing that keeps the horses from sliding, and forces them to rock their way down one step at a time, making a ""clip clop"" sort of noise as they go.  The middle ramp includes a smooth section that causes the horses to rush down the last 33% of the ramp.There is a turntable on which the horses can be mounted, which can be manually spun (no motor) to prompt some princess-anthem music.  Once the turntable is spun, a purple light shines across the entrance to the castle, and if a horse (or any solid object) crosses the beam of light, another sound effect plays.In addition to the large blue ramps, there are textured areas all over the playset that allow the horses to do their walking trick (for shorter distances).Happily, the dimensions of the ramp are just right for Matchbox cars to slide down and make the corners.Assembly wasn't too bad (although I believe there was one or two screws that necessitated a screwdriver), but some of the included stickers are supposed to be attached to the inside surfaces of some of the buildings, which are concave, recessed, and hard to get to.This playset is much sturdier and appears more durable than some of the Disney-brand play sets (such asthis Ariel Playset).  There are no hinges, or easily removed parts, so once you put it together, it stays together (and doesn't get any smaller for storage, unfortunately)."
This galloping pony toy is adorable, with bright colors and very thought out design. The little ponies and their princesses gallop! the put together was easy, especially compared to the little princess castle which was a pain to put together. My four year had fun with this immediately, and played with it for hours, and also added other toys to the stable fun. East to use, assemble and such a cute toy. It is a little fragile at the top where the roof is but not too bad, and the little flag falls off all the time. Otherwise perfect.
Easy to put together - the frustration-free packaging means that it's not a good gift for a kid to &#34;open&#34; - they just see a plain brown box on Christmas morning - but you can assemble it beforehand and present it that way.  It's a cute big gift - and fun for the kids - they are all drawn to it and like watching the horses clip-clop down the ramps.  Pieces are nice and big so my niece won't eat anything, but she sure will try to!  She slobbers all over everything.  It's like having another dog around.  But anyway this is a cute gift and good for a little girl.
"This toy was a hit right out of the box and when the batteries were installed it was even better. The horses ""klip-klop"" all around the castle stable and kept our little girl's attention for quite a while and the first toy she went to the next day. There are 3 more princesses to add which we will be doing as soon as possible.The toy is well constructed and should last for years.I highly recommend that all little girls a Disney Princes Stable."
My niece, who is three absolutely loves this toy! It's quickly become her favorite gift and I'm very glad I got it for her.
"Quick run down:Pros:- All the materials are good quality plastic, so you can tell it will last- lights and sounds- the horses move up and down via klip/klop of the horses, gravity (as opposed to electricity)- Characters from disney movies (2 total: Rapunsel, Aurora )Cons:- Not easy for a younger girl to get the horses going (hard to manage the princesses to go up and down the ramps, specially hard to get them walking in the entrances/exits (which trigger sounds and music) This makes it lose 1 star.- Horses go down 1 ramp at a time (it would have been nice if they went from the top to the bottom). Some of the ramps are just a few ""klip klops"" away.- Only hold the attention for a few minutes, since there is not much to it. Maybe when she is older (20 months right now) she will learn to enjoy it more.- Takes up a lot of space once assembled, there is no way to fold it or anything.Neutral and additional- Cinderalla and other more popular disney princesses sold separately... Would have been nice if they included a few of these.- 3 AA batteries required(not included), need a screw driver (3 screws to build) and placing more stickers- I believe the toy is more for ages 2+, 15 months seems a little young given that the horses/princesses are not very easy to get goingOverall it's a durable and decent toy, which might be good for some people. We were slightly disappointed."
My little niece is almost 17 months old, and she loves this toy. (It matches her Disney Princess training potty seat...ha ha ha!) The playset is super cute and is also surprisingly durable. The best thing about it is the realistic trotting motion the horses make, which is totally adorable. Also, it doesn't require batteries, which is a huge plus. It's a fun toy that will hold a kid's attention for quite a while...my niece never seems to tire of it! I definitely recommend this.
"My 16 month daughter was fascinated by this toy, just from the colors.  Throw in the horses, which ""Klip Klop"" down the ramp like actual horses walking, and she's totally in love.  Even my 4 year old son is interested in how they do that.  This is one of the most adorable toys I've seen in forever.Oh, and it was very easy to assemble.  Three screws.  Everything else just snapped into place."
"The horses use the ""magic"" of gravity to trot down the little runways.  HOW CUTE.  We were all addicted, even though I got this for my four year old daughter.  My two year old son, 13 year old daughter and 11 year old daughter kept taking turns.  Very, VERY, cool to have a kid's toy that is addicting and doesn't require batteries to be cool!"
This toy is super cute.  Cute princesses and horses and a toy to play with.  I have no idea why it's marketed as for an 18 month old baby.She has no problem taking this entire thing apart either with her hands or by pounding the horses/princesses on it.  I spend most of my time putting it back together.I'm going to put it up until she's 2.  I think by then she will be less inclined to damage and more inclined to play.
Fisher-Price Toys are a winner in children's toys. The toys are very durable and will last a lifetime. The Fisher-Price Little People Disney Princess Klip Klop Stable Toy is just one in millions small children will enjoy. This toy will give small children joy and happiness.
Growing up, I was a huge fan of the Little People garage AND horses... so I thought this little castle was a perfect idea.  When it arrived it was a huge hit with both my 5 year old and my 3 year old.  Since there are two horses, they both sent their horses down over and over.  Even my 1 year old was able to get the horse to go down here and there and was as happy as a peach when it worked.  The horses actually work really well and they clippity clop down the ramps; VERY cute.  There are two stables and some neat music as well.  Overall, a top notch toy.My only complaint is that the music wasn't working. Hubby opened it up and some of the wires weren't attached properly; he fixed them and it worked fine then.  Still, for most people (me included), I couldn't figure out how to fix it myself. So I'm not sure about the overall quality of the toy considering a basic thing like that was not caught.  It's held up really well since though and I am very pleased with it.
I was excited about this product because it's the perfect compliment to the Disney Princess Songs Castle that my 15 month old loves, but I quickly became disappointed with it and my daughter became very bored with it's limitations. On the positive side, the stable was relatively easy to put together and only required a screwdriver for one piece and the rest snapped together. It's made of durable plastic and is very cutely decorated and comes with 2 horses/princesses (Aurora and Rapunzel). My daughter does love watching the horses klip klop down the ramps, but becomes frustrated with the fact that the horses legs get stuck in the ridges of the ramp and the fact that on the ramp there's a slide and the horses get stuck in that too.There really isn't much play option value in this other than the turn table that plays music while the horses sit on it and the horses (sorta) klopping down the ramps. The box boasts of music and lights but the only music that plays is at the front door slide and on the turn table. My biggest issue with it is that it's bulky and if you want to play with the turn table, you have to turn the entire monstrosity around and if you want to play with the slide you have to turn the whole thing around again. I think the price (about $40) is way too high for the limited amount of play options and that the cost of buying one additional horse/princess is also too high ($10). Yes watching the horse klop down is fun and cute for a while, but that's where the amusement ends. If you're looking for a versatile and fun Disney princess product, I recommend going withFisher-Price Little People Disney Princess Songs Palace. This is way more fun and the princesses talk/sing and my daughter loves it. This stable toy is just not up to par.
"This toy is much larger than the impression I got when I ordered it. That was much the attraction for my grandkids, a boy and a girl, who love it. They call it ""The Castle Toy"" and you know when toys get special names that they are popular.Because of its large size, one kid gets on each side so it's easy to share. The horses clip pity clip down the walk easily, a very clever device They use this ""castle"" in combination with a large dollhouse and other similar toys when their friends come over and it keeps them occupied for hours.The durability is excellent, they have played with it for a good while now and nothing has broken. Overall, I can say nothing short of ""highly recommended!"""
My granddaughter likes this toy. She enjoys the cause-and-effect part of it - she puts the horse on the ramp and it clip clops down the ramp on its own. Every time a horse goes down the ramp, her face light ups, and it's magical for her. She likes the different actions that can be done, spinning the wheel around, making the horse pass through a sensor to trigger a sound, etc.All that said, she doesn't play as much with it now because there aren't many ways to re-configure the toy, or change how it's sitting. She likes to be able to change things up. I think if they could make the toy a little more interactive and adjustable somehow, she'd like it more. Overall, she still enjoys it, but doesn't play with it as often as I thought she would.
I know I am showing my age, but I really miss the old Fisher-Price sets.  My children had many of them and they lasted through all 3.  Now I wish I had kept them.  The old ones were made of wood with some plastic.  Now they are all plastic, and a different plastic at that.  What I miss most is all of the sets came with all of the people and accessories that went with that set.  Now they come with only one or two items and you have to add others to the set at an added expense.The Little People Disney Princess Klip Klop Stable does come with 2 princesses and each has a horse.  I would suggest putting this together before your little princess sees it.  It does require quite a bit of assembly and little ones get impatient and want to help.  You will need a Phillips screwdriver to put 3 screws into the stable.  One is also needed for the battery compartment, which takes AA batteries (not included).One of my frustrations with many children's toys is how hard they are to wrap as a gift.  If you want to wrap this one, it is easier than most.  It is primarily a rectangular prism, except for one corner that displays the princesses.
"We have a few toys that are similar to this - slides or ramps, cute dolls or animals. The slides usually see balls, cars, dolls, lego pieces, chalk and occasionally the intended toy.  Same here, but the horses are more entrancing. They rock as they move - the back legs actually move, causing the ""Klip Klop"" sound and giving the horse the appearance of both walking and rocking. The young one loves it.  Assembly was typical and took around 15 minutes. It's not collapsible so will take up some floor space - or a deep shelf.Overall, it's well made and has the typical girl's toy colors.  It includes two ""princesses"" - that we never heard off. The more popular ones are not included and cost $10 each (Belle, Ariel, Cinderella.) But for the almost-two year old, this really does not matter - they all look the same to her - and she loves playing with it."
Seeing as my daughter is about to turn one, we thought this toy would be too much for her. But she received another Little People set for her birthday, and she plays with it non-stop. Thus, we decided to open this one a little early as well, and she's hooked on Little People.Though she mostly eats the princesses and their ponies, my daughter loves to be able to play with the different LP sets interchangeably. I sometimes show her how she's *supposed* to be using them, having her get a sense of the sounds and how they are activated. The play set itself is pretty neat, and doesn't take up much room in either the living room or the little play nook in her bedroom. And come on: What little girl doesn't like Disney princesses?A great addition to her toy chest, though I admit much of the pricing can be a little high for LP sets.
My 6 mo and I played with this and as much as I love little people from when I was growing up, I didn't think this is that great. It comes with 2 little princesses and the just of it is they slide down the slide. So I guess that is what you do over and over. I found that the horses got stuck repeatedly. While yes it is cute and my daughter was fascinated at first, but not after the 4th time. I just feel like the play on this is limited compared to other little people items (noah's ark, the farm, the plane, etc) Not our favorite.
This Fisher Price toy makes a great present, as it is big, fun, and durable.  I also liked that the pieces are big so a young child would not likely choke on any of them.  I disagree with some of the other reviews, as the kids that I saw play with the toy found it very fun.  They liked the neighing and klip-klop of the horses.  The toy is big enough that more than one child can play with it at one time.  It comes with two horses but others can be purchased separately.  The castle does require adult assembly and 3AA batteries not included with it.  While the box says that the toy is good for 1 1/2 -- 5 year-old children, the ideal age range would seem to be 1 1/2--3 years old.  A five year old probably wouldn't play with the toy for more than a few minutes, as it is really designed for a younger age group.
