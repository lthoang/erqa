Top review:
"This product was designed for parents who are sick of their young kids taking over their smart phones or iPads. That's the theory anyway. Here is how it fares in reality:*Hardware*The screen on this is great, probably the best in the entire Leapfrog line. Puts the Leap Pad 2 to shame because it's so much bigger and higher definition.Feels sturdy. The box claims it is ""drop tested."" This is important because my kid is Mr. Butterfingers but since we've had it, he hasn't dropped it once, which is amazing. It does have some grippy plastic along the back and sides, which probably helps.I *really* like that I don't have to mess with batteries. Every night, we plug it in and it's ready in the morning. If we have to recharge it mid-day, it doesn't take long.Wireless is a feature doesn't seem to bring much benefit. All the videos are jumpy and slow to load. If you click on the icon for the web, it says ""Coming soon!""*Software*Comes with more apps than the Leap Pad2, some of which are totally useless. The Pet Chat app is one. It requires other children to have this exact app on the Leapfrogs and be in the same room. And then they can't even chat normally, there's only an assortment of pre-written texts that they can choose from such as ""Hi!"" and ""I ate too much."" My son will never use this.One benefit to the Ultra is you can add your own MP3s. On the Leap Pad2, you had to purchase a separate app the plays MP3s in order to have that function.This also comes with a calculator, a stopwatch, a calendar and notepad app. None of which my son uses at all.In summary, I really do like this item but it seems like you spend a bunch of money getting the Ultra only to have to spend a bunch more on the games and apps (which are not cheap!)Don't get me wrong, the Leapfrog games are neat and fun. My son likes them a lot, and while some are only marginally educational, others do reinforce things that I want him to learn. But the ebooks are $10-$20 each, and the games are $5-$25. You can see how that adds up really quick.But of course, this is true with *all* LeapFrog products, not just this one. If you are deciding between the Ultra and the Leap Pad 2, I would slightly lean towards the Leap Pad 2. The extra perks don't seem worth the extra money on the Ultra and since there is currently almost $70 difference between the two models, I would buy the cheaper one so I would have some money for the apps."

We have the original Leapster, LeapPad, Leapster Explorer GS, and my kids like this one best of all.+Big ScreenCool games (the Pet care game is upgraded... you can choose your pet and there are more features)Built in batteryDurableWiFi - don't have to connect it to the computer (big time saver for parents because connecting to the computer is not reliable/buggy)-Nothing so far!Overall, great product and very happy to have it.  Lots of fun and a good upgrade over previous Leap products.
My daughter has a LeapPad 2 that she uses daily. When I saw the ultra tablet, I was excited to get it for her.When it arrived I was surprised at how heavy it was. I think it is mine only, but it is not made that well. I can press the right side and the plastic goes up and down, it is fine on the left side. I immediately was on the hunt for a cover for this heavy tablet. I read a lot of reviews for the LeapPad ultra gel skin, at the time, did not have favorable reviews. People said it fell out of their hands and also did not fit the tablet. I then decided to get a leather case, like the one I got for her first one, theNew LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra Learning Tablet 2013 GREEN Leather Case Cover Wallet with Built in Stand - Accessories by InventCase & Exclusive to Sunny Savers. The case I bought was poorly made. It does not cover the Ultra tablet well and is very thin and cheap. Also, the holes do not line up. I am hoping with time there will be a good case for this tablet.Compared to my daughters LeapPad 2, this does have twice the memory and built in rechargeable batteries which I did not have with her first one but eventually added on. It has a large display area but I don't think that matters to her. Here are my pros and cons:Pros:* Built in rechargeable batteries* Double the memory* Easy to set up* Game cartridges are the same size, do not have to buy different versionsCons:* Volume buttons are not as easy to navigate along with power button, they are on the front of the LeapPad 2.* Battery charger are different, would have been nice to have universal for LeapPad2* Heavy and awkward for any size hands, I prefer the LeapPad2 size in my daughter's handsI keep both of them charged and accessible to my daughter. She has had the Ultra for weeks now but prefers the LeapPad2; it is easy for her hands and fingers. She tells me the other one is just too heavy and big.If you do not own a LeapPad at all, I would suggest the LeapPad2 with power. It comes with the rechargeable batteries and is of smaller size. I think the ultra could have been a better idea if it was lighter, thinner, easier to navigate the buttons. Personally, I do no think the ultra is any better than the LeapPad2 and I am glad my daughter owns the other one. She seems happier with the smaller one as well and that is all that matters.
Pros:physical design appears rugged & it has some larger buttonsIncludes choice of one app from limited listBundled basic apps offer functionality & fun but not long termCons:Physically heavy (at least for my arthritic hands & arms).Value (or lack there of)Wi-Fi worked for one day and then stopped. Have not been able to get it working again.Includes choice of one app from limited listApps from leapfrog's app market very expensive (compared to apps for ios and androidThe value of leapfrog leap pad ultra learning tablet is extremely low and limited.  This is not a more budget conscious kid friendly version of an android or even an Apple iPad tablet.  To me this feels like one of those learning laptops with the little black-and-white LCD screens that were made by VTECH, only with a tablet look that makes kids feel like they have grown-up technology, when, in reality, they are using a child's toy with a mildly techy facade.  And our home the leap pad ultra was used with a fair amount of excitement for an hour or so and then it was just left in the toybox because we can't afford a $7.99 or $30 app and the Wi-Fi was spotty at best (our home Wi-Fi is fairly predictable and doesn't cut out often but the leapfrog just wouldn't communicate nicely after that first hour or so, even though our other wifi devices were chatting away, at their usual speed).My advice is to look at other tablets AND the more rugged cases available for the tablet you choose. The value of the leap pad ultra is minimal the price you will pay for apps and the inability to scale it up as your child grows, without breaking the bank.  What I like so much about it tablets we regularly use at home, is that I can customize them for my son; I can add apps that are appropriate for him & I can set parental restrictions.  The value, the monetary cost, when considering hardware & software purchases lead me to believe that LeapPad Ultra is not a good value, or a bargain, when compared to more expensive hardware because in comparing, side by side, they are probably around equal cost, but LeapPad Ultra has a sort of planned obsolescence built in, in regards to growth and functionality as a child grows and developes, The operation of non-LeapFrog tablets is also more educational because kids are learning how to use a tool/tools that they will likely be using for the rest of their lives,  in some capacity.I realize how LeapFrog makes money with products such as this. Obviously, it's the consumables, and not the initial purchase of the device, that are there bread-and-butter.  I do wish they would've considered the technological savvy and the technology education needed by kids today, in designing their business model for the leap pad ultra as well as the operating system.  Perhaps someday there will be a firmware update that makes this product inherently more usable and scalable for kids of all ages while remaining appropriate and protected.  OL PC did it with their XO laptop and now I believe they're going to do it with their tablet.  I'm just surprised that it seems that leapfrog hasn't looked at other available technologies and similar products to try to figure out how to blow them out of the water. Instead They have pretty much stuck to the same principles of their other products have which are fine (don't get me wrong we have a few LeapFrog products that My son & I adore) but that also doesn't make this a modern tablet and I think many kids especially ones over the age of five will see that this is a toy and it's not really a tablet and the functionality is limited.
We have had a lot of LeapFrog products around our house, it's the one brand I usually buy when buying 'game' systems and stuff.  But they always had things that I didn't like about them.  I hate when you have to have batteries that go dead super fast (or buy the battery pack you can recharge, but it's way expensive), or I've had some that the touch screen never really worked very well.  I also didn't like that our original LeapPad we have had such a small screen.  This one didn't have any of those issues.  This comes with the regular rechargeable type batteries you'd find in any phone or tablet.  And they last awhile because we took it on a day trip where the kids played with it in the car for many hours and it lasted the full day with still some battery left.  While I still feel the touch screen could use some improvement, it's just not as sensitive as it should be, it is better than the previous products we've had.  The screen on this one is much larger than the other LeapPad's and the whole thing just feels sturdier, like it could be thrown around a bit and not be damaged (it has gotten tossed around a little, but not too much).I loved that I could hook this up to wi-fi and log into my account and it automatically put the games I had bought for the previous systems, onto this device.  These are the app games, not the ones you buy at the store.  The system allowed us to get one game for free as well and it had a much improved camera and video app.  You could also take pictures of people and then put those pictures onto animals, so you'd see an animal with the persons eyes (for example).  It was something that entertained my kids for hours, and it was included with the system with no extra money needed.  I hate when I have to buy all the games or activities in order for a system to be any good, so this was good- it came with enough stuff that it kept my kids very entertained on our trip.  I think the camera is something that never really gets old.You can also use the games (the ones you buy from the store) from the original LeapPad and another system we have (I don't recall which, but it's several years old) so I'm happy that those won't go to waste.  (I seriously hate when I have to buy new games every single time we get a new system, so this is a major plus.)Like I mentioned before, we got this when we went on a trip.  We actually went and visited my aunt who has no children and hasn't seen a LeapPad before.  She sat down to play with it a little and was amazed at how much SHE liked it.  She's a 50 year old women and she was entertained for hours as well!You can buy apps with a variety of games, depending on what your interest is.  I personally haven't bought more since we had a couple from before and then what it came with has been enough.  But when I do buy a game again, it will be an app one because the others are always getting lost.  Especially since once you buy them they will work on the different devices (once you register them).We were certainly impressed with this one and I feel like their products just continue to improve.  For me this was a big jump from the previous products we've had and is MUCH better quality.
"We have used many LeapFrog products in our home for our children. From the Tag system to the popular Leapster Explorer and LeapPad 1, we're experienced LeapFrog parents.The LeapPad Ultra was a terrific upgrade to the LeapPad systems. My kindergarten-aged daughter is using it, and she is fascinated with it. Any technical educational product that can engage a child's interest over time and grow with them, is worth looking into.I was immediately impressed with the weight, feel, and durability of this tablet. It is not a completely plastic casing like the LeadPads were, but it is a weighty metal construction with a rechargeable battery that is built in and not an add-on. The add-on rechargeable battery pack was the very first accessory we bought for the Leapster Explorer! It was thoughtful to have that already part of the package.As a parent, I have made good use of the Parent tools in LeapFrog Connect. Using Connect, I can configure the games to use the particular math skills being taught in her classroom that week, and even test her on her weekly spelling words. The customization available is a terrific asset, and a large advantage to this product.As I have come to expect from LeapFrog products, going from box to play was easy. I plugged it in, to charge the battery, and turned it on. A set up process walked me through configuring the LeapPad, and we were off and running. I did run into a problem where the WiFi was not seeing our home network. The online Support did not fix my problem. The online Support said to make sure your network was not having an issue. Being network engineers, I can assure you, our network was not the problem! Multiple devices were running on our WiFi while the LeapPad could not even find the network. We are still trying to sort that one out. To work around the issue, we plugged the LeapPad into a computer using the included USB cable and downloaded the LeapFrog software that way onto the LeapPad. All in all, in less than 30 minutes, even with the network issue, the LeapPad was working.The assortment of cartridges we purchased for the Explorer and LeapPad 1 all worked with this system. Also, the games we purchased for download to the Explorer downloaded to the Ultra too. This was another thoughtful component that added value to the system. Downloads are available for up to three devices, so anything you purchased using Download Cards for the Explorer will also download to the Ultra, provided that you log in to the Connect system with the same credentials you used to download the Explorer games. We have used the same parent account for many devices, and I was happy to see that all of that history followed us to the new device. Great job, LeapFrog!However, I confess to momentary sticker shock at the price of the ""apps"" in their app store. The apps are priced like the cartridges, $10 - $25. We have had an Apple iPad in our house since the very first model, and we are used to the iTunes App Store. We don't pay more than $10 for an app, and only for the really, really good educational ones! Paying $25 for an app seemed really excessive to me, on top of the cost of the LeapPad. I understand the educational value and customizations available in LeapFrog's apps, but even so, I found their prices to be excessive. It will take many weeks of chores for my children to save the allowance money needed just to buy Kidz Bop or Hello Kitty, which they immediately wanted because they were featured right on the front of the box, right below the ""11 included apps"" printing. Moving the pictures of the paid apps to the other side of the box front would be more straight-forward advertising. Also, using the word ""apps"" lends an established system of downloads and pricing to mind, and it was misleading. Perhaps renaming this to ""eCartridges"" would set expectations about pricing more appropriately, so it is not quite such a shock. As previous reviewers have noted, it is cheaper to buy the actual cartridges than to buy the ""apps"" online.The ""11 Apps Included - $80 Value"" on the box means basic operating system functions, like music player, calendar, and note pad. As iPad users, these are not ""apps,"" these are basic operating system functions. My children thought the included apps included the ones so prominent on the front of the box - the My Little Pony, Kidz Bop, and Hello Kitty. They were disappointed that the ""Choice of 1 App"" was only one of three choices, and all geared to the younger audience. My kindergarten-aged daughter already reads proficiently and is beginning second-grade math, so she was disappointed with the choices offered to her out of the box. She wants the paid apps. If you are giving this as a gift, consider including an app as part of the gift! Especially, if your child is an advanced learner or has a favorite Disney character that has an app.I am very satisfied with the LeapPad Ultra. Reservations aside at the pricing of the ""apps,"" I use and heartily recommend LeapFrog's products because of their researched, thoughtful, and tested end products. The customization in the Connect software is unparalleled. I do use all features of this product as a technically-proficient home. I am a technical writer and my husband also works in software technologies. We believe strongly in the technical education of our children, and are glad to see LeapFrog making strides to educate children in technology skills in an entertaining and fun way."
The Newest LeapPad Ultra is more expensive that the other LeapPad versions have been (or are currently) but I think it has some great features to offer.  Here are the features of the new LeapPad Ultra compared to the LeapPad 2 tablet:7-inch backlit Light-touch screen (compared to 5-inch backlit Resistive touch screen)1024x600 Resolution (compared to 480 x 272)800 MHz Processor speed (compared to 550 MHz)8GB memory built-in (compared to 4GB)Wi-Fi with kid-safe Web (no other LeapPad has had Wi-Fi)Motion sensor2MP camera and 480p video recording (compared to 240p video recording) - Oh and there is a camera on the front and backMP3 Player Built-In (previously it was sold seperately)Includes 11 apps - $80 value (compared to 5 apps and $40 value)Up to 9 hour battery lifeAC-adapter included (not included previously)Peer-to-Peer Play (this is completely new to the Ultra)Learning Path & Parent settings online12-month warrantyOverall, I am loving the new LeapPad Ultra.  It truly is a tablet that can grow with your kids and my son who is almost 7 doesn't think its babyish, which I know some worry about.  I think the only thing that LeapFrog can add really is to open up the Wi-Fi to approved by parents apps (my boys do miss Angry Birds from our iPad which is not available on the LeapPad.) LeapSearch contains Categories for kids to click on as well as Videos and Pictures but again its all safe content.I received this product to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.
We have the leappad2, as well as ipod touch, iphone 5, ipads, nintendo ds, and some consoles. So our 7 and 9 year old have played on a variety of units, including ones more geared toward adults and older kids.The Leappad 2 my 7 year old received for Christmas last year. It is still getting used 9 months later and still holding up well. My daughter likes the music playing function and camera's on it. She and my 9 year old son though still play games on it as well. Screen size, resolution, and replaceable batteries are its biggest drawbacks.The Leappad Ultra addresses those three main concerns. Bigger screen, more resolution, and built in batteries.  This one went to my 9 year old son. It set up easily over Wi-Fi and took about 2 hours to fully charge. First day we had a car trip and between playing at home prior to the trip and the 4 hour trip, the battery lasted about 8 hours. It takes the same cartridges we already had for the Leappad 2 so he had plenty to do. He has never complained about any lag time or any other issues in the week he has had it now. It seems fairly robust and hopefully will hold up as well as the Leappad 2 has. He says he likes it a lot and he is on the older end of the spectrum. He still likes the other choices he has and won't choose the Ultra exclusively, but he does play it get a lot of use from it so far. Like his Nintendo DS, the biggest drawback is game prices. You get spoiled grabbing iphone or android aps for a buck (or free) where here you need to pay more as the development costs don't have such a large audience to recoup them from. We grabbed most of ours when we see them on clearance to minimize those costs.Overall a nice unit and good upgrade over the Leappad 1 and 2.
"LeapFrog's LeapPad Ultra Learning Tablet is another winner from one of our favorite companies. The display is beautiful and easy on the eyes. This toy functions so much like a regular tablet, that kids are thrilled to have one ""Just like Dad's"". As with all of LeapFrog's products there are tons of wonderful learning games available, some using very popular characters.As to durability, one of my grandson's LeapPad went through a housefire, was under wet, heavy insulation and debris and worked FINE when it was recovered!"
My son was very excited to get the new big leappad. It was easy to set it up and download  the apps, and all the cartridge games from his old leappad worked there, too. I was a bit worried they will not look very good on the bigger screen with higher resolution, but they were just fine. Nice crisp pictures.Our favorite game is Mr Pencil saves Doodleberg, and my son mostly played this game. The new leapppad is not only bigger, but also it is more sensitive to touch, and it was sometimes frustrating when my son would try to write with the stylus, and accidentally touch the screen with the base of his hand or with his other hand. Another favorite was Thomas the train interactive book.Unfortunately, the leappad broke just after one week of use - the screen shattered. The good news - it is covered with a plastic film, and there were no sharp pieces. The device was still able to turn on. I contacted LeapFrog company, and they told me that accidents like that are not covered by warranty, but they would replace the leappad for us this one time. I was really impressed by that, didn't expect them to do it. They had me write return authorization number on the screen, make a picture and email it to them. Then they sent me a return label. Hope the new one comes fast. I am not sure what exactly happened to the leappad (maybe my son dropped something on the screen?) and why did it broke, is it because the new bigger screen is more fragile? The previous smaller leappad is still alive with the same (rough) kid user. The new leappad is also much heavier.I really liked that you can download the pictures or videos your child made on the leappad, and you can delete unneeded ones from the device using your computer.Overall, it is a wonderful device, with a lot of fun educational content available, and the customer service is really great.Edit: The replacement came. It has different AC adapter - smaller white rectangular one, not big green and round. I like it better - it is easier to find a space on the power strip for it to plug in.
I love all things LeapFrog.  LeapFrog makes learning fun and it helps teachers and parents with the repetitive tasks that many children use to learn.  It has the added benefit of being interactive which involves children in their learning.This LeapPad is extremely easy to set up.  It has the added benefit of being able to be charged while you are setting up the information for each child.  In the old days we would get ready to start and it would say come back in # hours when it is done charging.  The charge cord makes it usable right out of the box.Five steps:Power upSet up (connect to wifi)RegisterSelect and download gamesPlayThe LeapPad Ultra is larger than the earlier LeapPads and is set up to be more Padlike.  It has Wifi, camera, movie, and ArtStudio.  You can chat with other friends who have LeapPads. And eventually it will have internet.  This wasn't an issue for us yet but I hope it will be operational soon.The most amazing part here was that I was able to download tons of apps that I had already purchased once I signed into my account in the store.  I have never figured out how to do this before.  One game = one game unit.The only tiff I have with this system is the proprietary nature of all of the apps.  You can not add your own content or books to it.I think this will continue to be problematic because parents can buy tables or pads for about the same amount of money, or less, and still have control over the children's contents.  But generic tablets have a larger number of apps available and some competitive pricing.  As long as LeapFrog continues to keep their dedicated systems they are going to lose out on the crowd who CAN read.Oh, andDear LeapFrog,You know the Scrub-a-dub station where the children take their pet into the bath-carwash?  Please stop having them blow in the microphone to activate the dryer.  What they really do is spit all over my LeapPads.Thanks,Grandma
This was a birthday present for our youngest son, and he loves it. Battery life seems to be a complaint with them, however that is with non-stop use, so it's somewhat expected.There are two features that I find disappointing- the load times for games and the home screen, and the use of a mini-usb adapter rather than the now-standard micro-usb adapter.Overall the kids are happy, so I can't complain.
WE really love this product.  I love the educational games and products that are made by Leapfrog.  They really know how to make learning fun.  This product is a step up from the Leappad2.  It has a 7 inch screen instead of the 5 inch and has higher resolution.  It also has a faster processor and storage on the device jumps from 4MB to 8MB. Also like the fact that it has a rechargeable battery as I disliked having to keep replacing the batteries on the other Leappads.  I also like the fact that the games for the other Leappads will work on this one.  They offer lots of different games and ebooks that are for different ages.  Again my family really likes these products and will continue to buy products offered by Leapfrog.  My only problem is that I wish they would have put in a better camera but that is not a big problem.  Maybe next time.
"Having three children, we have owned various LeapFrog devices over the years.  In the world where Apple seems to dominate personal electronics, I was curious if the LeapPad Ultra Learning Tablet filled a niche that was not currently covered by an Apple iSomething or other.Being nearly 40 years old, I am well outside the manufactures suggested age range of 4 to 9 years old, so my test subjects were my three children, aged 10, 7, and 6.  All three children currently utilize iPod touches and an iPad.  The oldest also has a Kindle.Prior to giving the LeapPad Ultra to the children, I decided I better check it out first.  Initial configuration for Wi-Fi and setting up the kids profiles were quite easy for my wife and I.  We did not have much difficulty in figuring out any aspect of the setup of the device or an individual profileWe handed it over to the children and let them play with it for a month.  Despite my children having access to more expensive electronics, the LeapPad Ultra Learning Tablet was still a hit.  The biggest hit was the game ""Pet"" that came with the tablet.  Evidently, the app is a game where you can build a home for your pet.  I admit I have not actively played with this app, but to me it looked like a simplistic version of the WebKinz website.  As I said, I have not played with the app that much, so I could be way off.  The kids liked it though.I spent some time with the LeapPad Ultra Tablet to ensure I had some feel for the device.  One of the things I noticed right away is that compared to other personal electronics, whatever this device does, it does it slow.  It is slow to load, slow to launch an app, and slow to turn off.  I examined the LeapSearch internet area.  I was a bit disappointed that there was not some sort of web browsing capabilities on the tablet.  The web area currently consists of preselected/prescreened YouTube videos and various pictures.  A check of the App Center showed me that most apps seemed to cost $7.50.I asked each of my children what they thought about the LeapPad Ultra Tablet.  While this seemed to be a popular device amongst them, they had surprisingly little to say:7 Year Old:  Liked the game called Pet.  Ranked the device 4.5 stars out of 5.10 Year Old:  They liked how you can have your own profile and customize it.  They did not like how it loads super slow.  They did like the LeapSearch function and showed me a few videos.  They also gave a thumbs up to the Art Studio app.  They gave the device 3.5 stars out of 5.6 Year Old:  The comments of my 6 year old virtually mimicked my 7 year old.  They specifically mentioned they liked the included Pet App.  They rated the device 4 stars out of 5.As I mentioned, I was curious of the LeapPad Ultra Tablet filled a niche not currently covered by some other device.  After using the device for about a month, I honestly believe it does.  If I had a younger child that was at the stage where they wanted to have a device like mom, dad, or a sibling, but you did not want to spring for an Apple product, then this might be a good alternative.  I think it would be an excellent choice for a child who has not yet developed the fine motor skills to manipulate an iPad Touch.While I would not hesitate recommending this product for younger children, I would also recommend possibly considering other options.  A base iPod Touch with a 3 year Accident Protection warranty from SquareTrade(vital for delicate electronics used by children in my opinion) would run about twice the current price of the LeapPad Ultra Tablet.  The iPod Touch would offer you much greater versatility than the LeapPad and most any app a child would use is free or has a minimal cost.  Purchase a dozen apps from LeapPad and you have almost made up the difference already.  The iPod Touch or similar device might not be a feasible solution for everyone for various reasons, but it is something worth considering."
"We've come a long way from the initial 2gb storage with the first LeapPad model! With 8gb now, you can easily have hundreds of apps on the LeapPad. We took full advantage of the back to school sale on apps and filled it up with a range of skills for everyone. I love that you can customize settings, allowing only the content you want. While the built in browser is already kid safe, it's nice to know that I can turn that off when I really just want them to play games and work on skills. The new, bigger screen is beautiful and the resolution has improved greatly. Games look much better now, even older titles. I loved that I could just plug the Ultra into my Mac, where I already have the LeapFrog software downloaded, and all our purchased content was right there for transfer to the new device. So easy! The software itself seems to have improved as well, as I felt more informed about the progress of what was going on rather than just seeing that it was ""syncing."" I can see which titles are being transferred and a percentage is given to show how far along it is, which is very helpful with antsy children waiting to play!While the overall unit feels quite a bit heavier than older models, it's still about the weight of a 1st generation iPad. It seems to be okay for the kiddos as they can still play for hours without complaining, but I was concerned at first that it was too heavy for little hands. They have improved the design with rubbery texture on all the black areas that you see, making it much more grippable. This was always a gripe with the previous models. They were just so smooth and slippery! This addition is very nice. The front facing camera is also a very nice improvement since kiddos don't have to fiddle with the awkwardness of taking self pics with the rear camera.While the LeapPad 2 first gave us rechargeable battery packs, I love this new built-in rechargeable battery. The estimates of 9 hour battery life appear to be very accurate. It may sound silly, but I'm really glad they ditched the removable batteries altogether. I have a couple kiddos who LOVE taking out batteries, and since the LeapPad battery covers are designed to be opened with the stylus, it's always been too easy for them to get them out by themselves, even with the rechargeable battery packs. So hooray for no more battery covers!The biggest change here, aside from the size and resolution of the screen, is the addition of wifi. My kids haven't utilized it very much as right now it's still a bit clunky and doesn't scroll smoothly like they are used to with MY iPad (who am I kidding? My iPad is still theirs, even with the new Ultra in the house) so they haven't showed much interest in it. If the browser was able to play flash content so that they could enjoy content on flash-heavy websites like Nick Jr and Disney, that would be a different story, but as of now it's not terribly exciting for the kiddos. However, I like the ability to purchase apps right on the tablet rather than doing it all on the computer. Nice touch! Getting closer and closer to iPad with each of these little improvements. It's also a bit annoying at the same time because the kids can also browse (if I allow it in parental controls) so I'm regularly hearing about what game they want next!One complaint I have is that currently the mp3 player isn't terribly functional. If you load more than one album, they aren't separated. All songs are organized in alphabetical order, so for kiddos who can't quite read yet, it's hard for them to navigate to the song they want to listen to. With the iPad and iPods, they can at least see the cover art and they start to learn the names of the songs they like just from seeing them over and over again. It's just kind of silly the way they have it now. My kids don't want to scroll through dozens of songs trying to find the one they're looking for! Other than that, we are very pleased with the new Ultra. I hope it really takes off this holiday season as it's easily the best iteration of the LeapPad so far!"
"We have countless Leapfrog toys they make great fun/educational stuff. This has been a wonderful upgrade for my daughter from her Leap Pad2 which is much smaller with far less features. They are similar as in both have front/back cameras,attached stylus/come with similar preloaded apps and have countless apps, and skins and accessories available.They are however different in that the Ultra is faster yeah, bigger but not too heavy and huge yeah!! and has some limited internet access. It has held a charge for about 5/6 hours so far. It may go longer but we plug it in often when not in use.My daughter was starting to use my Kindle and her brothers tablet more than her old Leap pad so this upgrade was awesome in that way. I will add this was giving to me free for an honest review and I thought it was a bit pricey all things considered for the price $150.00 you can get a ""real"" tablet but I think I would still choose this as Leap Frogs products hold up to rough handling/drops/spills from the kiddies not sure other tablets are built for that. So I would be inclined to choose this maybe by Christmas it will drop in price and improve some of the firmware many people have been having problems luckily not us(yet)."
"First, this tablet has its limitations. The camera is really poor quality. The device is really slow. The Leapfrog dude's voice is, as always, annoying.It took about 20 minutes to set up, which isn't too horrible. You can only input 3 users. (It will show 3 user profiles and 1 guest profile. If you have more than 3 kids, somebody just has to play as the guest.)Now, you get 11 apps. Yay! Right? No. Not so much. 10 of the apps are preloaded. Without them, this thing wouldn't really do anything. So I don't see why they are advertised as a perk, when clearly they are a necessary function of the toy. I guess we should be praising LeapFrog for not making us buy absolutely everything. The one app you can choose, is limited. You can't just pick any app available.Once you get it all set up and your sweetie starts playing, it isn't long before the ""does this thing have more games?"" start. Now, you go check and see what additional games will cost you, and you choke. Ebooks are cheaper than games, but seriously, the money pit this thing is will astound you. I really hesitate to spend that much money on intangible items. I guess I should look at it from the perspective of buying an experience, not a toy. I quickly realized that my kid isn't going to get the full benefit of this tablet. I'm just unwilling to pour that much cash into upgrading it. And as it is, with 11 apps, it just isn't all that much fun."
I bought my grandson a leapPad last year and he loved it, so I got him the LeapPad Ultra Tablet. It is compatible with the LeapPad cartridges and you can download the apps you have on your childs LeapPad onto the Tablet. It is another great product from LeapFrog. My grandson loves it and has no problems operating it. He didn't even need instructions. The games are fun, as well as, educational, so everyone wins.
"This product was designed for parents who are sick of their young kids taking over their smart phones or iPads. That's the theory anyway. Here is how it fares in reality:*Hardware*The screen on this is great, probably the best in the entire Leapfrog line. Puts the Leap Pad 2 to shame because it's so much bigger and higher definition.Feels sturdy. The box claims it is ""drop tested."" This is important because my kid is Mr. Butterfingers but since we've had it, he hasn't dropped it once, which is amazing. It does have some grippy plastic along the back and sides, which probably helps.I *really* like that I don't have to mess with batteries. Every night, we plug it in and it's ready in the morning. If we have to recharge it mid-day, it doesn't take long.Wireless is a feature doesn't seem to bring much benefit. All the videos are jumpy and slow to load. If you click on the icon for the web, it says ""Coming soon!""*Software*Comes with more apps than the Leap Pad2, some of which are totally useless. The Pet Chat app is one. It requires other children to have this exact app on the Leapfrogs and be in the same room. And then they can't even chat normally, there's only an assortment of pre-written texts that they can choose from such as ""Hi!"" and ""I ate too much."" My son will never use this.One benefit to the Ultra is you can add your own MP3s. On the Leap Pad2, you had to purchase a separate app the plays MP3s in order to have that function.This also comes with a calculator, a stopwatch, a calendar and notepad app. None of which my son uses at all.In summary, I really do like this item but it seems like you spend a bunch of money getting the Ultra only to have to spend a bunch more on the games and apps (which are not cheap!)Don't get me wrong, the Leapfrog games are neat and fun. My son likes them a lot, and while some are only marginally educational, others do reinforce things that I want him to learn. But the ebooks are $10-$20 each, and the games are $5-$25. You can see how that adds up really quick.But of course, this is true with *all* LeapFrog products, not just this one. If you are deciding between the Ultra and the Leap Pad 2, I would slightly lean towards the Leap Pad 2. The extra perks don't seem worth the extra money on the Ultra and since there is currently almost $70 difference between the two models, I would buy the cheaper one so I would have some money for the apps."
"The Leap Pad Ultra is clearly meant to be a product designed to carve out a niche in the tablet market. While many of us have seen the spoiled youngsters in the supermarket or at the restaurant tapping away on their own iPad, it's unrealistic to think that every kid should own one or that parents need to buy them for their kids. Personally, I think it's ridiculous to stick a $500, high-tech computer into the dirty, careless and irresponsible hands of a toddler. But, that's a whole other topic...The Leap Pad is made to look like a tablet computer for kids, and that's just what it is. It has a very large touch screen, wi-fi connectivity, downloadable apps, a video recorder/camera, a calculator, and music player. Like previous ""Leap"" products, this product is designed to be durable in the hands of children. It has a solid feel in your hands and boasts the familiar green-and-white coloration of most of its predecessors. My family has owned three other Leap Frog products, and we have always been happy with them. Like all of the others, this one can work through a battery pretty quickly. (The packaging says it has a 9-hour life, but I would say that 8 is more realistic!) At least this product has its own rechargeable battery so we don't have to purchase that separately. That is a nice upgrade!Most of the apps that you can purchase for this Leap Pad have at least SOME educational value. Sure, there are some that are purely for entertainment, but I think Leap Frog seems committed to marketing this product on the established foundation that their devices are first and foremost for fun, but educational purposes. One feature I can appreciate about this new LeapPad is that it can run all of the apps we previously purchased for the Leap Pad 2. While these games may now be ""old"" and have lost some of their appeal, at least we didn't have to start from scratch to build a new game library. No more mini-cartridges to keep track of! Now it's all downloadable apps!Overall, the Ultra an improvement over the Leap Pad 2, but it is questionable as to whether or not it justifies the significant bump up in price. If you don't already have the Leap Pad 2, I would recommend this one, instead. If you already own the Leap Pad 2, you should be just fine sticking with that device."
My 5-year old and I were eager to give the new LeapPad Ultra a try and compare it to the LeapPad 2 which we already owned and loved.  Straight out of the box the tablet is noticeably heavier and clunkier feeling than the LP2.  I realize they were trying to make this version bigger and feel more like an adult's tablet but for little hands it can be a bit much - I think it would have more appeal to older kids.Since we already had an account set up with LeapFrog, all I had to do was run LeapFrog connect and sync the tablet which took nearly 30 minutes - be prepared to spend some time on this when you first get it, especially if you are not already registered with LeapFrog.Once the tablet was synced my daughter didn't waste any time exploring and checking out all of the features.  The tablet comes with 11 apps - my daughter really enjoys the Pet Pad Party and the MP3 player and the kid-safe search browser. It definitely feels to her like she has a tablet like Mommy and Daddy's now.  My biggest complaint is that compared to the LP2 this one seems painfully slow.  Anytime you click/tap on the screen to go to a new app or change something, or when you turn the tablet on or off it seems to take forever.  The LP2 was not nearly this slow.My favorite feature of the tablet is by far the rechargeable battery - after about 8 hours of use we can plug it in and charge it, so nice to not have to keep buying batteries!  I also really like the little hidden compartment to slide the stylus into.  The camera and video features are easy and fun to use - my daughter had no problem figuring these out fairly quickly.We were very disappointed to learn that the Hello Kitty game app that we had downloaded just a few weeks earlier for the LP2 was not (yet) compatible with the LeapPad Ultra.  While most of the apps are compatible with the LPU, be aware that not all of them are.  I made a comment on LeapFrog's Facebook page about the problem and they commented that they are still working on making all of the existing apps compatible and in the near future we should be able to use the app we had purchased on the new tablet.  Encouraging news, but frustrating when we had just paid $20 for an app that didn't get played much before the upgrade to the newer tablet.  This is the only game we've encountered with this problem, although there may be others - check the game description before buying the apps.We have not had any issues with charging the tablet or using the Wi-fi connection, no freezing or crashing as long as you are patient with how slow the tablet moves.My daughter said she prefers the LeapPad Ultra over the LeapPad 2.  If it weren't for how incredibly slow the LeapPad Ultra is, I would agree 100%.  Children's wants are obviously different from the parents, so take everything into consideration before making a purchase.
"We've owned the original LeapPad, LeapPad2, and recently the LeapPad2 Power. We've also owned the InnoTab and InnoTab2S. Our favorite has been the LeapPad2. But then in walked the LeapPad Ultra . . .SO, HOW ARE LEAPPAD2 AND LEAPPAD ULTRA THE SAME?- Both have a front and back camera. On the LPU it's now placed to the left and off to the side.- Both use a stylus. On the LPU it's placed on the bottom instead of the side. This helps with the whole left-hand right-hand dilemma.- Both have a cartridge port for additional games, and uses purchased apps. Previously owned games will transfer once you register, and old LeapPad cartridges will fit.- Both come with preloaded apps. The LPU comes with 11 apps, the LP2 only 5. When you register your LPU you get one free app (pick one of 3 preselected apps, not any app in their app store - bummer!).- Both have additional accessories you can buy like gel skins, carrying cases, ac adapters (now included with the LPU), and headphones.- Both have a mic, and volume (now moved to the top right side of the tablet, I find it awkward here). I couldn't find a contrast button on the LP2--it's very bright.HOW ARE LEAPPAD2 AND LEAPPAD ULTRA DIFFERENT?- LP2 has an age requirement of 3-9 years. LPU is upped to 4-9 years.- Faster processor. However, the LP2 took 5 seconds from the time you selected an app to load. The LPU between 10 - 13 seconds depending on the app. This part is a bit of a struggle with small kids and I'm not quite sure why this didn't improve. A big disappointment is that it took LP2 only 21 seconds to reach the main app screen, but LPU 59 seconds!!! This is a huge disappointment, I really hope that changes with the next LPU2 (because you know there's going to be one).- LP2 is smaller with a 5"" screen (480 x 272). LPU is larger (about the size of the InnoTab) with a 7"" screen (1024 x 600 resolution). In fact, the LPU reminds me a lot of the InnoTab in shape and size, but the LPU is much more solid. It looks and feels like quality hardware. The color scheme is much the same as the LP1, with more white than green, or pink (if you purchase the pink one, there's no pink on the green, or vice versa). The LPU also seems more durable.- LPU video recording is now at 480p. That's not high definition, but it's better than the 240p the LP2 offered.- LPU is more touch friendly and pressure sensitive. This was always a problem for us. My son started using the LP2 when he was 3 and preferred to use his finger over the stylus, but the LP2 wasn't always responsive that way. LPU is more like an iPad. The stylus is more for writing games, but you can still use it to select apps and navigate.- LPU uses a rechargeable lithium battery that can be charged using the included AC adapter, or USB chord. Get up to 9 hours of play. We haven't used ours long enough to know if it really lasts 9 hours, but I'm assuming it does, or is fairly close. Battery life indicator is on the top right corner, just like you would find on most tablets (as well, the Internet connection quality). The LP2 used a battery compartment and took 4 AA batteries, the LPU's battery is internal.- LP2 comes with 4GB of memory. LPU has 8GB! More than enough for our needs.- LPU includes some new apps. The one I was most excited about was their Utility Suite. This includes a calendar, calculator, notepad, clock, voice memo, and stopwatch. This was a nice bonus! The Innotab came with a few of these apps, and I always thought it was a nice touch. As well, LPU comes with a standard MP3. I wondered why LeapFrog made us purchase this as an additional app, (it only became included with the new LP2 Power).- LP2 works a lot like an iPad and tilts with just about everything, including the menu screen.- Power button has been moved to the back.- LPU comes with a Pet Chat App. I'm not so big on this one, just because I think texting is crazy enough, and here we are teaching little kids to text. However, that's what we do these days, so I guess they might as well learn--safely, and responsibly, using pre-assigned completed words (no OMGing and LOLing here). Kids can send each other emoticons, but not pictures. To use this feature kids have to pretty much be in the same room, or the same house. The two tablets do not connected over the Internet, they just communicate by being in close proximity (about a 50 foot range). My son hasn't had an interest in this one, mainly because he has no one to chat with yet.- There's a parent control access. Parents can enter a code to lock down what you don't want your child to have access to, such as purchasing apps from the app store. By the way, setup was very nice, I thought the process was very easy to understand, and found our wireless connection very easily.- One thing that's really cool is the new peer-to-peer play apps. We haven't been able to test this yet either, as we only own one tablet. But I'm really looking forward to my kids being able to play games together. (Again, players must be in the same room, no racing with kids across town). Through the Pet Chat app kids can play additional simple games like tic-tac-toe.- LPU has thick rubber that runs along most of the sides of the tablet for extra padding. LP2 was just plastic all the way around. Still, you probably want to purchase a gel-skin for this anyway.- Okay, let's talk Internet capability. This is the exciting addition. The InnoTab 2S kind of touched on this, and I mean, kind of, because they didn't allow for any browsing capability. It was only for downloading apps, which you still couldn't do directly over the tablet. LPU knocks it all out of the park. Now kids can use LeapSearch to connect to the Internet using a kid-safe-browser. Kids can search for images, videos, and websites by category, and view content that has been preapproved by LeapFrog's panel (a bit 1984 to me, but makes sense). Apps can be purchased through the LeapFrog store and synced over the Internet (we haven't used this feature yet). One nice feature is that kids can browse the app store and look at games, books, videos, and songs that they like and add it to a wish list. You can enter your code and purchase it for them.WHAT'S THE OVERALL REIVEW?Yeah, get it!My son just turned 4, and by far this is the best ""toy"" tablet. With all of the incredible updates and additions, it's as if LeapFrog heard what parents and kids wanted, and redesigned a new tablet to accommodate our wishes--but still with the value and vision LeapFrog is known for. My only reservation is that the speed is slow and it sometimes crashes, or ""fake"" crashes and you're sitting there wondering what's going to happen. If it does crash just press the power button and hold it. I haven't lost any information, it just reboots. If you're in a position, I still think an iPad or a Nexus 7 is a good buy for a kid, with a good protective case. These ""toy tablets"" are great, but they have limitations. Buy into one knowing that they aren't perfect, but they sure are durable and kids do enjoy/love them.Hope this review helps. Definitely would suggest passing on all the other tablets and purchase this one. Curious to see what vTech (InnoTab creator) has to offer in competition. One thing I would like to see on the LPU is an ability to add videos/movies. The InnoTab2 offers this ability, but you have to convert videos and I found it a pain, but would like to see LeapFrog improve on this and offer this feature on their tablets.**If you haven't already taken advantage of this, here are two FREE app codes:The Book of Super Awesome Stuff (e-book): 5813 1140 1518 1413Alphabet Stew (game): 5813 0790 4610 4973UPDATE: What is the deal with this LeapPad crashing so much???!!! That's unacceptable for small kids. Downgrading my rating from 5 starts to 4 stars. Time will tell if I drop my rating again..UPDATE: It stopped crashing so much :)"
"Having had the LeapPad and LeapPad2 I was excited about the LeapPad Ultra. It's still just as fun to use as the former and the excitement is still there but, after using it for a few days, it's more tempered.The improvements?1) The screen. Much bigger and much better resolution than the other LeapPads. Also gone is the plasticky covering for the screen. This makes for a crisper display and hopefully it will withstand little hands poking at it with/without stylus.2) Batteries. There's now a built in rechargeable battery which means kids can now be in charge (pun intended) of keeping it full as it's much easier to plug in the AC adapter compared to having them try to remove/recharge/replace the old AA batteries.The letdowns?1) The ""web"" part. I was looking forward to having something similar to the functionality provided by Microsoft's Family Safety but instead you just get a set of categories (animals, sports, plants, etc.) and within those you can look at some (preselected?!) videos and pictures. More so, I tried some of the videos and after a minute or so the playback slowed down to a crawl (and even caused the LeapPad to restart). Clearly this area needs some work to get the most out of the WiFi capability.2) The speed. I was hoping for the Ultra to be faster than the LeapPad2 but it's about the same (if not slower at least for screen changes) as the LeapPad2. This is not bad but one can ask for more, right?A final note, the Ultra feels a lot heavier than the predecessors. It's not comfortable to hold just in your hands for a long time. It needs to either be on a table or rest on one's lap."
If you and your child have never used a standard tabled such as an iPad, Kindle Fire, or Google Nexus this product might be alright. But if you've used a real tablet you probably won't like this. It's slow, glitchy, and has bad graphics. And seeing as you can get tablets for not much more I don't see the point in buying this. Also, apps for this are expensive. Most of them run $15. I was hoping my three year old might like this LeapPad and let me have my iPad back. But when she plays on the LeapPad it is so slow she gets frustrated and asks for my iPad anyway.
"If you have kids who have been using Leapfrog's various game platforms, especially the LeapPad, the Ultra extends the usable life of the platform for your child a bit longer by making it more tablet like. A larger screen with higher resolution and wifi to connect to the internet (what appears to be a very limited browser was still in development when I last checked) give older kids more to play with.A notable difference between the Ultra and regular LeapPads is that the Ultra has a built-in, non-changeable rechargable battery. It generally lasts a long time and charges relatively quickly (several hours) but could present a problem for long trips.As a parent, when setting up the Ultra you are prompted to log in with a PIN so be sure to write this down or use something memorable. This allows the parents access to the store but keeps kids from making unapproved purchases and changes to the account. In essence, this step takes the place of downloading and installing LeapFrog Connect. Once connected, you have access to apps for the Ultra as well as any other applicable apps that may have worked on the smaller LeapPads. This is a nice touch - some companies might not allow something as simple as sharing apps like this. What bugged me was that there is no way to tell what has been already downloaded or is downloading. All apps available in your account are simply marked ""Download"" and don't change once chosen.As an adult, I find I'm annoyed by some things kids don't seem to care about - so take these from that angle. The on-screen keyboard is *very* sensitive and lead to many mistypes, which was especially frustrating while setting up our wifi password. Swiping between screens is a hit and miss affair. Sometimes you get it to swipe, sometimes not and you wind up opening an app.These issues are minor. As an adult you expect more - you would rip Apple to shreds for behavior like this on an iPad. Your kids will love it, however, just like mine do - they don't notice these minor problems. It's bigger, brighter, bolder, better in almost every way. It needs a firmware update to smooth out some rough edges, and I'm betting that will come some time soon to help spur good reviews in time for the holidays."
I have a 4 and 8 year old. We have the monsters leappad2 as well as the ultra. Not surprisingly, they both prefer the bigger screen and creative features. The applications compared to the smaller versions are almost three times the size.This allows my 4 year old to see the pictures clearer, but it also makes dragging a little more difficult since he has to hold down the bigger piece longer and move his arm more. I'm not negative over this since it give him the exercises he needs to build strength. (He is a true ambidextrous and without a favored hand, both are not as strong as if he chose one over the other)My eight year old loves the record-able mic and creative art sections. He also uses the notepad, which is like a Microsoft Word sheet, which you have the option to save. I usually have him practice his spelling words on that without protest. No need to buy rechargeable batteries or a recharger pack, it comes with a charger that can also stay plugged into the wall as well as a usb plug to sinc with a computer or use with a car adapter (sold separately) for car rides.Since both my boys are still very young, I have not taken advantage of the wifi feature, for safety reasons. The boys do not know any differently and there is no difference of the games on either of the leappads. Will update when I activate the feature.I do recommend buying a screen protector for the tablet.XtremeGUARD Screen Protector (Ultra CLEAR) For LeapFrog LEAPPAD ULTRA.
I have to say I am loving the new Leappad Ultra, my Son may not be getting this one back (Just Kidding).At $149 the Ultra is not cheap, it's almost in the price range of a Nexus 7 but the Nexus 7 would open up your kids to a whole world of things that you might not want them to see.  The Leappad ultra is a Kids safe device that allows internet access and many other activities but only on sites that are Kid safe and it can only download kid safe learning apps and games.Out of the Box The Ultra is impressive, it's Heavy, it's solid and it certainly feels like something that will last.  I suspect Leapfrog knows this and that's why they give you a full 1 year warranty.  When have you bought a Toy for your Kid that came with a 1 year warranty??Powering up the Ultra you instantly notice a super bright screen with pretty good resolution and Color. It beat all my expectations for screen quality instantly.The next thing was connecting it to my Wifi network which was surprisingly easy and painless.  It pretty much uses the standard screens you see with all devices so you should have no problems.  Next you setup your kids account and set that magic 4 digit Pin code that prevents them from purchasing Apps and Games without getting your consent.  All of this worked really well and on top of that you get one free app.  Most  apps are in the $5+ range, which sounds expensive but it's not because kids will play each one of these games for days and days and the best part is that they are designed to teach not just entertain so it's money well spent.Quick Technical Specs:2 cameras, front and back (2 Mega pixels but they do take pretty good pictures)Boasts 9 Hour battery life but my son gets about 7Mp3 Player that pretty good and can get fairly loud.Built in stylus with strapFirmware is auto upgradeable via the WiFiReally rugged design, that's well thought out and very nice looking.Negatives:I did see a few lookups of the unit, not too many that I would worry and Leappfrog has already sent a firmware update that fixed some of that, so I expect by Christmas it should be very stable.Final Comments:If you can afford it, get it! I suspect that this unit is going to be this year's hot Christmas seller.  It's really good, the screens are clear and bright, the games are fully interactive and it really talks up a storm and gives the kids a lot of enjoyable interaction.BTW Ultra owners can play along with other kids that have an Ultra and they can chat to them.  Overall a very good investment that should last a long time, this is not some toy that will be put down 2 months later, this is the kind of toy a kid will use for a long time.
I was sorely disappointed in this product.  The preloaded apps aren't terribly fun for kids.  Why do they need a voice memo app?  And the camera isn't very fun either.  The two apps we played were the MyPets app, but it has limited functionality, and the Art Studio app which is fun to draw and color.  The touch screen seemed to have issues as I had to press over and over again several times.  I went to the app store to buy more apps and found the prices to be $10-25.  And a lot of them were just episodes of TV shows.  I am returning this and buying a Kindle Fire for my daughter.  She can get tons of free apps and it has parental locks.  Plus, with Prime I can get tons of TV shows for free.
"This tablet is more comparable in size to a standard tablet. It is a definite size improvement over the LeapPad 2. I would say that it has almost twice the screen size. I also like that the stylus slides into a hole rather than snapping into a groove like on the LeapPad 2. It's much easier to keep the pen locked in place.==Pros==*Wi-fi is probably the most noticeable improvement on this device. It's wonderful to be able to access the app center or the parent area without having to plug the LeapPad into the computer.*Built-in rechargable battery with included cord(this is a MUST)*Larger screen size.*Design seems more ergonomic and easier to grip and hold.*Web Search and App Store features can be disabled in the Parent Center if you don't want your children to have access to them.*Compatible with all of the games for the LeapPad 2. I was able to sync the apps we previously had purchased for the Leap Pad2 and use them on the new LeapPad Ultra.*Kid/User-friendly - my boys were able to easily figure out how to customize the leap pad.*Durable - We've had this for about a month and in that time it has been dropped, banged on the floor, tossed in the bottom of a bag, and it's still up and running. Durability is pretty important when kids are involved and so far everything is still good!==Cons==*The load time is sometimes a little slow. Plan on it taking a good while to load the apps onto the device.*My son loves the web search feature (it's essentially just pre-selected you tube videos). Most of them are OK, but I'm not crazy about all of the cover songs, etc. Not totally sure I want my four-year-old singing ""Suit and Tie."" Maybe I'm a prude, but that's my preference.*There have been a few glitches every now and then getting something to load, but it's usually a very minor detail that works itself out if I turn it off and on again.*Apps/games can be a little pricey, but we've just learned to wait until things are on sale (they run fairly regular app sales)There are a few features we probably won't make use of. The ""Pet Chat"" only lets you use pre-selected phrases (which is just fine), BUT it only works if you are chatting with another person on a LeapPad Ultra in the same room as you. I appreciate that my child can't talk to strangers on the Internet, but we don't know anyone else with an Ultra, and if we have a friend over, I'd probably rather them play with each other rather than sit on a couch touching pre-selected phrases. Again, that's just my personal preference.From an educational perspective, I love that the games and apps help to teach my kids important skills (but there are plenty of games ""just for fun."" We've loaded a couple hours worth of videos like ""Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood"" and ""Super Why"" which makes the LeapPad Ultra fantastic for road trips.My son loves the built in camera. He takes picture with it constantly. As a mom, I love that he can have fun and learn something at the same time (and it's a sanity saver on long road trips). My biggest challenge now is keeping my boys from fighting over it."
"Leapfrog has always been one of the front runners when it comes to children's educational technology. Now they bring you their second generation children's tablet, the LeapFrog LeapPad Ultra. Unlike the previous Leapad, and Leappad 2, the Leappad Ultra truly in my opinion deserves the description ""Tablet"". Like all previous editions the tablet is touch screen compatible, it comes with one styluses (which is attached to the tablet itself), AC Adapter, and a LeapFrog USB adapter so that you can connect it to your PC and download applications directly from the Leapfrog Server Website as well as charge the Tablet itself.The tablet is medium-lightweight and easy for a child or adult to carry from place to place. It is backwards compatible with all Leapfrog Explorer cartridge games as well as most original Leappad downloads (I don't believe the micromods work with the Leappad Ultra) .  The Leapfrom Downloads are extremely child friendly and great for any child ages 3-10.  My 6 year old daughter absolutely loves this and plays it a couple hours a day, as well as my 3 year old son. This has not only increased both of my children's vocabulary but has taught my daughter how to trace letters and now she's writing very well as well as improved her addition and subtraction.I absolutely love this as an extra educational aid, and now they've finally fixed my one big issues with the previous models which was the constant use of batteries. The Leappad Ultra like an Ipad or Android Tablet can easily be plugged into your computer to charge or use the AC adapter. There is also a Car Charger which you can purchase separately for educational fun on the go!. When fully charged will last up to 9 hours which is plenty of time for educational fun.So what's the difference between the Leappad 2 and the Ultra? Well The Leappad 2 and Ultra both come with front & back cameras/video recorders, however the Leappad 2 has 4gb of memory versus the 8 gb you get with the new Leappad Ultra. Also the New Ultra has kid Safe Wifi powered by the Zui network which is limited to kid friendly topic and interests. The Ultra also has upgraded the screen to a new 7 inch HiDef 1024x600 as well as improved the processor/computing speed. Everything else is exactly the same.As a bonus Leapfrog gives you 11 free apps 10 are per-installed and 1 you get to choose from when you register your device.So if your kids loved the original Leappad and you're thinking about upgrading and wondering if it's worth it the answer is a Definite Yes! And if you're new to the Leappad this is definitely the one to invest in your kids, nephews, nieces grandchildren will love it!"
My daughters love playing with my tablet and phone, so I decided to get this product because I figured if the worst happened and they destroyed the tablet they were playing on, at least it wouldn't begin with an *i*.The tablet is sturdy and well suited for younger kids. My girls are not overly rough with it and are in general easy with their toys, so this has not been put through the worst kids can do, but its survived some bumps and drops.The main drawback is the assortment of apps that is included are not that great. For example, one of the apps is the *welcome* message. I realize that buying the tablet is almost the least expensive part, that buying the apps and cartridges are part and parcel of the territory, but I really do not like having this huge selling point being a large selection of apps to begin and those apps being near worthless. Granted, there are a couple that my kids love, but overall it was a gimmick and I resent it.The other problem is loading and switching between apps and pages takes forever. There is quite a bit of lag time, enough my kids have asked if there is anything wrong with the machine, and I need to tell them to be patient.So overall I'm not unhappy that I got this. My kids enjoy it and I enjoy not worrying about if it gets broken or not. Just be prepared to shell out for apps from the very beginning.
"I have a 3 1/2 year old daughter.  Like most kids her age, she is tech savvy.  She has had a LeapPad2 for several months, and now this new and improved LeapPad Ultra.  In addition, we have an iPad mini and a Kindle Fire HD.  Those devices are not hers, but she is allowed to play with them sometimes.In many ways, the LeapPad Ultra is an improvement over the LeapPad2.  The display is considerably larger, 7"" in comparison to 5"".  There is a built in rechargeable battery, very limited internet capability, double the internal memory space for apps, improved cameras, and a faster processor.  All of our old downloaded games transferred over to the LeapPad Ultra, and the cartridges that I bought for the LeapPad2 work as well.  I do think that it is rather slippery for a small child to hold, and recommend buying a case for it.Here is my issue though about ""kid"" tablets.  At the current pricing, the LeapPad Ultra costs almost as much as many ""adult"" tablets.  Here is a comparison:  As of the date of this review, the LeapPad Ultra is $149 and the 16 GB Kindle Fire HD tablet is $199 (it was just on sale recently for $30 less).  The LeapFrog content that you can purchase for the LeapPad Ultra is very good, but it is also quite expensive.  The eBooks are $10 to $20 each, and the games are $5 to $25 each.  Do a bit of math, and you will realize that the cost difference between the two previously mentioned devices will disappear quickly with some book and game purchases.  The Kindle Fire HD has a parental control program available called Kindle Free Time Unlimited.  It is currently $4.99 per month, or $2.99 per month if you are a Prime member.  (There are also plans available for multiple children.)  Kindle Free Time Unlimited is a fantastic feature.  For the small monthly cost, you have access to thousands of apps, games, and books at no additional charge.  You can pick and choose what your child is allowed to access, you can limit access to the internet, and you can even set time limits for various activities.  Since I am a Prime member, I can also allow my child to watch the Prime videos that I choose.  (Over wi-fi only for the videos.)  All of this is controlled by a 4 character parent password, and it took me less than 30 minutes to set up for my child.So, to sum it up - if you are convinced that you want to buy a ""kid"" tablet, then I recommend the LeapPad Ultra.  As of right now, I think it is the best kid tablet on the market.  But, if you want to branch out to an ""adult"" tablet that can be totally and safely customized for your child, then I highly recommend a Kindle Fire HD with the added monthly service for Kindle Free Time, and a decent protective case."
With the increasing number of tablets, it is hard for something like the leap frog to compete. They don't have near the features and apps of android or apple products. Also the apps are very expensive, with many costing over $10. It is durable and well made, but my 5 year old never pucks this up over the iPad
"My four year old son and two year old daughter both love this learning tablet.  They have a regular LeapPad 2 as well as a Innotab, but this tablet is their absolute favorite.  When my son first saw it, he said, ""It's big!""  It is definitely a larger size than the regular LeapPad 2.  It was very easy to setup and comes with lots of fun apps and gives you an additional free download of a free app (from three to choose from.)  My son especially loves the music app that comes with songs to play. It has WiFi and safe websurfing for kids.  Something else I really loved is that it remembered the apps we had previously purchased for his LeapPad 2 and gave us the option to download them to to this one.  Another thing is that it is very durable and has survived many drops.  Charging it is simple and quick.This is definitely the best LeapPad there is, and I would recommend purchasing this one as opposed to the cheaper LeapPad 2."
"My 5-year old daughter absolutely loves her LeapPad and she was thrilled to get a brand new LeapPad Ultra. I think if you're looking at both and trying to decide, the Ultra is the way to go if it's within your budget. Yes, it's a lot more expensive, but I think overall it's a better product with better longevity. My quibbles with it are very minor, but I'll list the things I like and things I don't like quite as much about the product when comparing to the LeapPad/LeapPad 2.Pros:Built in battery - The old LeapPad ate through batteries so it's nice to be able to plug it in.Larger screen - My daughter really likes the bigger screen on the new Ultra. It definitely allows for better visuals when playing a game and it's also nicer to have a larger screen when watching videos.Built-in mp3 player - This wasn't even an option on the original LeapPad. On the LeapPad 2 it's an app you have to purchase. It's nice to be able to load up all my daughter's music for her.Front AND back camera - The original LeapPad only had a camera on the back and there are sometimes when your child might want to take a selfie.Easy setup to start playing quickly - The setup process is quick and easy and your child can be off and running right away.Built-in wi-fi with kid-safe browser - The previous LeapPads don't have wi-fi which is very nice. It's cool to shop the app store directly from the device, too.Voice memos - This may seem silly, but my daughter LOVES to record herself in the voice memos app that is built-in. She records all kinds of songs and things and then plays them back later. This has got to be one of her favorite features. What kid doesn't love recording themselves?Backwards compatibility - Works with all the same games as the previous LeapPad. If you already own games from the previous system, you can use them with this.Cons:Built in battery - I know this was on the ""Pros"" list and I think it is, but some might not. Just make sure that sucker is charged before you set off on your adventure.Bigger size - This one is definitely bigger than the LeapPad/LeapPad 2 and it's heavier. This might be an issue for smaller kids (or moms with smaller purses).Untinuitive to get games onto system during setup - I don't understand why my previous purchases couldn't be downloaded all at once via wi-fi during setup. I had to plug it in to the computer to do it. There seemed to be a way, but it was an app at a time and it wasn't intuitive.System load sometimes freezes/takes awhile - We've experienced some freezing on power up. Shutting down and turning it on again seems to correct the issue. Hopefully this will be addressed in a future update.Overall, as you can see, the ""cons"" are really just some small annoyances. Overall, this is a solid product and we're really happy with it."
