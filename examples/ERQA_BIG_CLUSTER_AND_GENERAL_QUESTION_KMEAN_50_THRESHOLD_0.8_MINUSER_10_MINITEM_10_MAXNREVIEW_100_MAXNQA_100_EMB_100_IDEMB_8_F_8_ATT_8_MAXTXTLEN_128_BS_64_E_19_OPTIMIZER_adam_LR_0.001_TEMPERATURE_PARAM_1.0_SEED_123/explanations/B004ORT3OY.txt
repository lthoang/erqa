Top review:
While I got this as a Christmas gift for my 2-year old I went ahead and opened it up (very carefully) and played with it a little bit so I could do my review for it.  When they say Kid-Tough, they MEAN KID-TOUGH!  Your child can throw this camera at a concrete building and I think it would stay intact.  Granted, this makes it a little heavier than the normal camera but you'll want it this way.Using it is fun AND easy.  The selling point of it is the swiveling lens.  If you have ever used the back camera of an iDevice you know how fun it is to take videos or pictures of yourself and how easy it is when you can actually see yourself as you do it.  Not only can you take pictures you can take pictures with a pacifier in your mouth, a clown's wig, a mask, you name it!  The cool part about this feature is that it lets you know when you put the special effect in the right place by showing a check mark.  It prevents guesswork for your little one.The only 'downside' is that the pictures lose clarity if it's dark.  However, it's still a toy and I'm keeping that in mind as I write this review.  It isn't an adult's digital camera with a working flash.  I bought my niece and nephew toy cameras last Christmas and they are nothing compared to this one.  I can't wait for my daughter to open it on Christmas Day!

Reviews:
First of all I must say that I got this through the vine program and just because it was free doesn't mean that I'm going to give it 5 stars.I saw the manufacturers recommended age and decided that this would be great for my god-daughter who just turned 3. I gave it to her and she was super excited to start taking pictures right away since she is always asking to use her mothers camera. I was only able to observe her taking pictures for about an hour so I can't really say whether it will hold up to her constant dropping of it. From what I saw it seems like it is pretty durable and may be able to withstand a toddlers rough handle.The camera itself isn't worth the price tag that they're asking for. It takes very horrible pixelated and blurry pictures even outdoors. I know it's a toy but for that price I thought the pictures could have been better. She enjoyed taking pictures of herself so the fun value may be worth it. Would have also been nice if a USB cord was included so you could download the pics to print, so beware if you're getting it to also grab one unless you already have one at home and don't mind sharing.I'd definitely recommend this camera for anyone under 4 maybe 5 but definitely not a 7 year old. For the price I'd get theKodak EasyShare Sport C123 (Red  New Model)which is a few bucks cheaper and a much better camera especially if your kids would love to print their pictures.
"I am a mother of 2 and this is our 3rd ""kid"" camera. First, we bought a 2nd generation Fisher-Price Kid Tough Camera, which was durable, fun, and took terrible pictures. When we lost it, we bought a V-Tech camera,Vtech Kidizoom Plus Digital Camera - Pink, which was durable, fun, and took pictures that were slightly better, but still not great. Finally, we got this camera, the newest, latest, and most expensive Kid-Tough release from Fisher-Price. It's durable and fun, as expected. But it still takes really awful pictures, especially indoors or in low light!My 5 year-old daughter has enjoyed this camera. She has fun walking around the house taking pictures of the cats, and she likes that she can turn the lens around to take pictures of herself. But she would much, much rather use my $100 Sony point-and-shoot, and frequently asks to do so. Bottom line: I would definitely recommend this or any other V-Tech or FP Kid Tough camera for children under 4, for whom durability and ease of use supercede picture quality. But older children will be disappointed, as I am, that Fisher-Price still hasn't taken the effort to make their camera take decent pictures."
"Most kid cameras are basically a webcam in a nice sturdy casing.  This one is no different, except that the design let kids take pictures and videos of themselves with the swiveling lens.There's no flash, but the camera actually does pretty well without it.  We bought the very first Kid-tough camera, which did have a flash, and this new one takes better pictures even without it.  The LCD viewing screen is decent - not high resolution, but good enough to frame and view the pictures.  This is good because, unlike the other kid-tough cameras, there's no eye-holes to look through.  You have to rely on the LCD to see what you're shooting.Pictures are what you'd expect from this type of resolution.  Yes, they'll suffer from a bit of distortion, CA (purple fringing), and don't have a lot of fine detail.  In low light they're grainy, but really for young kids none of this matters much to them.Compared to the cheapo Vivitar cameras that are 5+ MP, which we bought for my Son, I'd rather use this camera.  It's more durable and similar in picture quality, regardless of what the megapixels say.Video mode is easy to use, captures audio, and has a decent frame rate.  Playing it back is easy, and the speaker is loud enough to hear the audio, too.  Minimal controls make it easy for little ones to figure out.  If you rotate the camera lens while recording, the sensor doesn't switch the orientation, so you'd have an upside-down video.  However, rotating the lens then recording works as you'd expect with the resulting video right-side-up.Digital zoom goes in steps, and of course picture quality goes down considerably since it's just enlarging a small part of the screen.The only ""weird"" behavior I've seen from it is that sometimes it doesn't adjust the exposure properly when there's large contrast.  So pointing at something in a deep shadow then moving to a brighter area takes it a while to adjust.The little lips, moustaches, and hats can be overlaid on the screen while framing a picture or after-the-fact.  Fun for kids, but you can't adjust the size or position of them, so it's of limited use.Battery life is good, too.All in all, a great started camera for young kids.  Once they're old enough to not break a real one, you could step up to a name brand camera with optical zoom, etc."
"Don't expect this to be a high-end camera. It is a solid low-end camera that really works well for the price. And it really is sturdy. Before writing this review, I dropped the camera from about three feet onto our wooden outdoor deck and then from the same distance onto a tiled kitchen floor. Barely a scuff on the camera and it still works fine.I don't like the aesthetic of the camera, but of course I'm not the target demo. I let a five-year-old play with it, and he thought it looked ""cool.""Honestly, I can't see kids being disappointed with this. It's simple enough for them to use almost right away, yet it still has a professional enough output to be worthwhile and not just a toy. I'd advise getting a flash memory card, though, if you want to do a lot of videoing."
So, my daugther loves to takes pix with my camera or iphone.  So she was ecstatic about having her own camera.  She has fun time taking pix of everything.  Camera itself is very easy to use and durable.  She's dropped it around the house numerous times and still works like new.  The camera can be moved to take pix from the front or the back.  I havne't used the software yet, so can't say anything about that.  The camera itself has a few pix editing features which are entertaining at first, but my daughter doesnt' seem to care for it much.  Anyways, great camera for kids to own.
This  camera the perfect gift for any 3-7 year old girl! My daughter was beyond thrilled that she was getting her own camera to use after always wanting to take part in taking the family photos. This camera gives her such independence and I love that I don't have to worry about it accidentally getting broken because it's super durable!The buttons on the camera are very large, straight to the point, and easy to use! The special effect features are really fun as your child can add graphic stickers, frames, and more. The free pc software that comes from the manufacturer Web site has where your child can make books, cards, and other fun things!We love this camera not only takes photos but videos too! This camera takes mildly decent photos and videos in low light but even better when outdoors or in more lighted areas.The rotating lens on the camera is really neat because you can take pictures of yourself or whatever is in the front view of the camera. Overall this is a fantastic product and I'll probably be purchasing one in the boy colors for my son when he's older!
The Fisher-Price Kid-Tough See Yourself Camera is made of durable plastic, and it would be complete, if a 50-cent USB cable was included. The SD card inclusion would allow many snaps and making video, but also could require a slightly higher price... maybe. The camera is an excellent tool to start teaching photography and video recording the youngsters and to spend high quality time together by the whole family.Everything about this camera is easy to learn for average 3-7 year old kids. They can record explorations, research, and artistic endeavors on their own while having a lot of fun. That playtime can be extended at the computer or tablet after connecting by the cable thanks to the free PC software from the manufacturer Web site or the Preview application native to Mac OS or free Android apps.  The PC program allows adding silly stampers, and create books and cards. The camera can also be useful for the elderly.
This Fisher-Price digital camera for the kids has few functionalities -- it's low-resolution, cannot zoom optically and has only 256MB built-in but can accommodate an SD card -- and it's really bulky, but it works out pretty well for small children who want to snap photos. The lens can swivel 180 degrees so the kid user can take pictures of the ceiling and of themselves. The lens is of the wide-angle type so a self-portrait can fit in two or more kids.The interface is simple and even my toddler had no trouble using it -- except when he turns it on, he always pushes the power button too far and end up shooting video all the time. The power button could realy have been made better, so small kids don't end up turning on the video mode all the time.  Otherwise there are only a couple other buttons, one for delete, one for stop, one for special effects (mostly clownish things), and one for left-and-right scrolling.  Then there's the big blue shutter button at the top.The LCD screen is small, which is not surprising given the price point of this camera.  Shutter delay is short, but because the camera lacks good optics, it's not approrpiate for serious picture-taking, and probably insufficient for anyone older than 12.  But for small kids, it's a lot of fun to use and it's build to withstand rough handling.
"The Fisher Price Kid-Tough See Yourself Camera has a few cons that cost it half a star for me, so I'll get those out of the way* Biggest issue - if you insert an SD card with existing pictures on it - those pictures are automatically erased. So you always want to insert a new or emptied card.* The USB cable should be included so you don't have to hunt for one - the batteries are included so it is ready to go but not the cable for downloading and kids want to download right away.PROS* Easy to use and the kids love this camera. They can swivel the lens to take pictures of themselves or of others.  The ""Smiley"" button lets them add hats/hair stamps, distort facial features, or add things like beards or an elephant trunk to the subject's face.  No end of fun there for the kids.* The camera is durable, no worries about them dropping this camera - it will last.* The camera has an automatic shut-off feature if the kids don't use it and it kicks in pretty fast for battery conservation.*The camera features are so enticingly fun to see and use that older kids and even adults will want to take a ""try"" which makes the camera more of a family experience.OTHER NOTESThe camera makes sounds when the buttons are depressed, which means if the little ones are taking pictures at a ""quiet"" occasion, you are going to hear it. It would be nice if there was an ""off"" button for the sounds so the kids could mimic adults in these instances (at a wedding, awards ceremony, etc.).The camera is pretty much gender-specific with flowers on the one meant for girls - I wish they'd been decorative and colorful without being quite so gender specfic since kids often like a particular color (my daughters always liked blue and often had the ""boys"" version of a toy for that reason).The picture quality is clearly not that of a camera intended for an older user and this should be kept in mind when purchasing the camera - it is meant for youngsters as a durable piece of equipment. If your child is old enough to be fussy about picture quality for printing than this is not the camera for them.STILL - with the cons and the notes this is almost a 5 start camera and well worth the fun the age group and the family has with it!"
This camera is absolutely amazing! It is a real, functioning digital camera with a childlike version of photoshop (of sorts)...  My daughter has taken hundreds of photos with this camera and she has the option to add clown hair, a pacifier, horns, and a dozen or more other silly things to her unsuspecting subjects. This is her most-used toy from Christmas this year.  She has dropped this camera a couple of times, with no adverse effects or problems of any kind.There is a port on the side of this camera, it looks like I can download her images to my computer.  I haven't tried this yet, but it's nice to have this option. I have to admit,  I am really impressed with this camera!
This camera is an AWESOME camera for kids! Especially if you're going on vacation or have a child who is interested in computers, photography or art. My son was enthralled by this camera on first sight. It was easy to figure out and he loved that he could edit the pictures on our computer. My only qualm is that the box says it is for 3-7 year old kids, but i don't think a kid under the age of 4 could really appreciate it.
While I got this as a Christmas gift for my 2-year old I went ahead and opened it up (very carefully) and played with it a little bit so I could do my review for it.  When they say Kid-Tough, they MEAN KID-TOUGH!  Your child can throw this camera at a concrete building and I think it would stay intact.  Granted, this makes it a little heavier than the normal camera but you'll want it this way.Using it is fun AND easy.  The selling point of it is the swiveling lens.  If you have ever used the back camera of an iDevice you know how fun it is to take videos or pictures of yourself and how easy it is when you can actually see yourself as you do it.  Not only can you take pictures you can take pictures with a pacifier in your mouth, a clown's wig, a mask, you name it!  The cool part about this feature is that it lets you know when you put the special effect in the right place by showing a check mark.  It prevents guesswork for your little one.The only 'downside' is that the pictures lose clarity if it's dark.  However, it's still a toy and I'm keeping that in mind as I write this review.  It isn't an adult's digital camera with a working flash.  I bought my niece and nephew toy cameras last Christmas and they are nothing compared to this one.  I can't wait for my daughter to open it on Christmas Day!
"I have always been partial to Fisher Price products, and this one did not let me down.  Out of the box, it was apparent that this was a sturdy camera (I hate to call it a ""toy""), meant for little hands and (possibly) big drops.  I liked the fact that the camera came with batteries, although I'm not sure how long they will last (I would suggest having some extra batteries on hand - someone else mentioned that there is no USB cord included, so you need to get one so that you can download pictures) The buttons are large and easy to reach on the camera, so little hands have no trouble manipulating them.  My favorite feature on this camera is the rotating viewfinder, which takes the guesswork out of taking pictures of oneself.  In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not go online to manipulate the pictures we took with the camera, so I can't speak to how easy the online site is, but if the online features are half as user-friendly as the actual camera, then I don't see children having any problem with it.  Overall, I rate this toy five stars because of the durability (if it is like most fisher price toys, it is durable enough to pass along to the next child), the ease of use, and the fun features (like the rotating viewfinder) Overall, I would say that this camera would be well worth the investment."
This is a fantastic camera for the budding little photographer in your life.  The camera is very easy to use right out of the box, it did not take us long to figure out how to snap pictures and add lots of fun, silly effects before we had even read the directions.  My 3 &  year old had fun taking pictures of herself and being able to see herself on the screen while she was taking the pictures - this is easily accomplished with the lens that swivels on top of the camera which I think is very clever, my favorite aspect of the camera.  The zoom lens on this is actually pretty good, a great feature to help encourage creativity.Another nice feature is that you can upload your snap-shots to the computer to view and edit them, as well as share them with others.  You can add even more special effects, and organize them and even make your own cards and photo-books.This camera is VERY sturdy and built to last - it's already survived a few drops very easily.  It's big and somewhat heavy compared to your average point-and-shoot camera and while this adds to its durability it's also a bit of a down-fall as it definitely takes two hands to hold onto this thingOverall we're thrilled with this - it's a little on the pricey side but it's built so well that we know it will last for a long time.
"I received this kid tough camera as part of the amazon vine program,and I gotta say..wow..Im impressed, it was so easy for my 3 &5 year olds to figure out..takes great pictures and video! Plugged into the computer no problem..so glad they have this so they can stop using my phone and camera to take pictures with...My daughter and son took a total of 254 pictures and 58 videos without an additional memory card before it was full. I just have them go through and delete the not so great ones and the ""keepers"" get put on a disk.When they say tough they mean it, this bad boy has been tossed and dropped off anything from the couch to the bed of our truck and its holding strong!This toy is a must have if your kids are anything like mine and love to take pictures...ive already recommemded it to all my friends with young children..Way to go fisher price..Well done indeed!!"
This is the best camera out there for young kids.  It is very durable, and very fun! It is a perfect gift for any child age 3-7.&lt;> PROS &lt;>- Extremely durable.  Even after being dropped several times it works like a charm.- Auto Shut-Off prevents batteries from being drained when not in use.- Lens swivels to allow children to take photos of themselves.- Very easy to use.  A truly child friendly camera.- Special button allows children to do fun editing to photos. They can add hair, hats, beards, etc.  They can also distort facial features.- Batteries included.&lt;> CONS &lt;>- Does not include USB cord.
My three year old daughter LOVES her camera.  It is ridiculously easy to use, and the buttons are almost intuitive by nature.  The rotating lens allows for self pictures, and it takes better quality photos and video (with sound) than the first two digital cameras I bought for myself.Transferring images to a computer is a snap, and requires no downloading of software.  It does not come with a connection cable, but most of us have about six or seven lying around the house anyway.  There is software available for free from Fisher Price that young photographers can use to add effects etc. to their pictures.Unit is very durable with a rubberized shock resistant exterior.  Designed to be dropped and dropped again.  Outstanding value for young photographers who want to take pictures like Mommy and Daddy, but aren't ready to share Mommy and Daddy's expensive camera.
This was a gift to our 4 year old grandson. It is very durable and lots of fun. By far the best feature is the swiveling lens that is used for self-portraits. Not only do you get to be the star of the picture but you can take it yourself. The extra things you can add to your picture: horns, clown nose, vampire fangs, sunglasses and more make for plenty of laughs. The biggest con is that there is no flash so without really good lighting the pictures just don't come out very good. Still all in all our grandson has had a great time joining in on capturing great moments with his new camera.
My two-year-old is obsessed with my digital camera. He loves to take pictures and videos and then watch himself. Unfortunately, I'm a little nervous letting him handle an expensive digital camera. This Fisher-Price-Kid-Tough Camera is the perfect solution to my problem. It's definitely durable enough to take the drops and bumps that will inevitably take place. It's easy for him to use. It didn't take long for him to figure out how to take a picture. The See Yourself feature is fantastic. He loves watching himself on the screen.CONS:*It is SUPER easy to delete pictures and videos on this camera, so if your little angel takes a great picture you may want to upload it as soon as possible. I think my son had just as much fun deleting pictures as he did taking them.*It does NOT include a USB cable, so keep that in mind. They're not very expensive, but with the price of this camera, I wish one would have been included.All in all, it's a great little camera for little ones. It's easy to use, durable, and my son really enjoys using it. Picture quality is decent, the images on the view screen are not as clear as those on my own camera, but they definitely get the job done. As a mom, it's great to have my own camera back again :-) Everyone is happy.
My 4 year old loves playing with this camera. With the camera being able to rotate 180 he can take pictures of himself and his friends and other things. It also allows more freedom in the angles for taking videos. He can use the built software in the camera to edit and place objects in the pictures or use the software on the PC to do the same and more on the larger screen.The camera has a rubberized outer shell that makes the camera easy to grip and absorbs the knocks and drops. The buttons are easy to use and the screen is slightly recessed into the case to provide some protection.I have a 32GB SDHC card made by Adata that my Nikon D7000 hates. I stuck it in this camera and it has been working fine.The camera comes with a wrist strap but no USB cable. Probably not a problem for most but but if you don't have one you'll need a Mini-B connector for the camera end. Given the cost of the camera I'm not sure why they didn't include one.I've seen in the literature for the camera that they put low light performance as a bullet point. Low light performance in my opinion is spectacular. Indoor pictures in general are not good with this camera unless you have a lot of lights on or windows with full sunshine. Also overall picture quality isn't anything to write home about. If my son wasn't so young that might be a problem but right now he doesn't know the difference and is happy with it.Overall I think young children will enjoy playing with this camera and it should last for a while.
"My 3 yr old granddaughter adores this camera.  She takes it everywhere she goes and even sleeps with it (""Something might happen I want to take a picture of, gamma!"").  The swivel is great and she loves to pose with people and take a photo.  She gets a real kick out of the special effects and loves to make the dog and her brother look funny.I wish it came with a USB cord because I had to hunt for one, eventually taking one off another item, so that she could download her pictures.  That is the only negative thing I can say about this camera.  The picture quality isn't superb, but this is a child's camera so I consider it good enough and she thinks it is perfect."
With multi-megapixel cameras coming so standard, it is a bit disappointing that this camera has such poor picture quality.  Even so, my 3 year old really enjoys using it.  The controls are intuitive and simple.  However, there is no way to turn down or off the volume of the buttons, and they are rather loud (and annoying) after a few pics.  Of course my child loves the sound, so he presses the buttons over  and over!The rotating lens is a nice feature and makes for some fun self-portraits.  We gave this to our son during our last vacation to use, and we found a rather amusing series of photos from this self-portrait feature.There are also funny images you can add to photos right from inside the camera, such as party hats, fangs, and funny noses.It is really well built and feels like it will withstand anything a child can throw at it.
"Ever since my cousin let my 4 year old son play with her digital camera, he's been begging me to let me use our camera. Instead, I decided to get him this Fisher-Price Kid-Tough camera. Now, if he could write this review, it'd probably be a very enthusiastic ""I LOVE IT"" followed by about 86 exclamation marks - and in a way, that's all that counts, so if you're looking for a fun toy camera for your kid, this is an excellent choice. However, as the adult writing this review, I have a couple of additions to put his enthusiasm in perspective:- The good: this thing is STURDY. It's taken some punishment and hasn't died. Definitely as tough as advertised, which is amazing. It's easy to use. It's got a swiveling lens so your child can take a self-portrait, which is really neat and provides lots of entertainment. It's got an auto-shut-off feature, which is wonderful because my son always leaves his toys on, draining the batteries.- The Bad: well, if you're looking for professional quality pictures, you'll be disappointed. My son doesn't care about this. If you do, don't get this camera. Also, the camera makes noises when buttons are pressed, and (as far as I know) you can't turn these off, so you may not want to have Junior play with this during a wedding or something. Finally - really, Fisher-Price, you couldn't have thrown in a cheapie USB cable? Shame.All in all, this is a fun toy and a great way to get your child interested in taking pictures. Despite some reservations on my part, it's sure to be a hit with younger children, especially ones who have shown an interest in using your camera."
This camera is pretty cool and seems very durable!  It's big, so I don't know how well it would fit into little hands.  I love the swiveling lens - great idea!  The downsides are that it doesn't do well in low light, and it seems like the photo effects can't be moved around the screen (correct me if I'm wrong).  So you have to position someone's head at the right place and distance to have the wigs, mustaches, etc line up.  But if your kid isn't interested in effects, this is pretty cute!
