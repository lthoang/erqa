"The objective of Casa Grande is to make as much money as possible by building structures with plastic blocks and cardboard platforms. Whoever makes the most money (in Casa Grande Lire) wins.It did take us a while to figure out the game rules using the manual. It's not that the game is complicated; it's actually pretty simple once you understand how to play. Now, after having played the game, I can decipher the instructions, especially since Ravensburger uses a lot of black and white photos.  It seems to me that the problem is the wording in the manual can be confusing.  It left my teenager staring at the page trying to understand exactly what we were supposed to be doing.Once we figured it out, things moved along easily. You roll the die and move your piece clockwise along a board of squares that surround a series of smaller grids. You must then place a building block somewhere within the grid that corresponds to the square that you landed on. There's strategy involved in aligning blocks to be able to fit platforms to build multiple stories-ultimately building upon your opponent's structures in order to earn money.The blocks, platforms and markers are all color-coded to each player, so there is little confusion, even while players alternately climb a ""bonus scale"" with an additional marker that is identical to their playing piece.It was easy for our children to put together platforms when they saw how to align the foundation blocks with the lighter squares on each platform . It's pretty straightforward when you're looking at it, but again, we found the directions to be confusing at times.  It is provided in multiple languages. We figured that something may have been lost in the English translation. This is an important aspect, since there is more going on than rolling a die and landing on spaces.The board, pieces etc. were all beautifully covered and designed. Casa Grande is a bright and imaginative strategy game. It is durable, with thick, solid pieces-including a well constructed cardboard box-a welcome addition to board games that we've only found in those offered by Ravensburger, so far.This is not your typical strategy game. It is creative and fun when you learn how to play. However, due to the initial confusion of the English version of directions, I have to give this a four-star rating. Also, when you're heavily involved in constructing multiple levels, things can get precarious. Players must be careful not to knock over the higher structures."

My oldest loves board games, and she's a pretty sophisticated reader, so the instructions were not hard for her. However, I can see how some kids might have a little trouble following the basic setup. It's a pretty complex game, but fun once you get the hang of it, and it gets more fun the longer you play it. The sophistication adds to the staying power of the game, and it's pretty exciting. My younger kids were able to get the hang of it after a while, but it did take some time and they needed a little help. The game is a bit fragile, and so it requires more careful play when building and manipulating pieces. Definitely not built for rugged play. Overall, a good family game.
We got this game because we really like to play board games. The game is fun to play whether you have just two players or four. It's a lot of luck, just like any game, but strategy is definitely a key factor. I have played the game with my in-laws and there can be a bit of tension if another player gets cut off. So if you are that kind of person, you can have fun messing up other's plans. I'd say it's very adaptable to whatever group you've got. At first it seems a little complicated, but after the first round most will understand and try to find new techniques to master the game. I would definitely recommend it if you are a small family or like to play with other couples. There can only be up to 4 players and a minimum of two so definitely take that into account.
In Casa Grande players try to construct large and tall buildings on lots. Your opponents can use your buildings for their own purposes, and the final result should be one large Casa Grande house constructed.Casa Grande is played on a game board that shows a square grid for the building area, which is framed by a track. At the start of the game, each player receives a number of building blocks and differently-shaped platforms. Each player also receives five bonus points and one pawn, which is placed on the track.At the start of each players turn, the player rolls the die and moves his pawn forward on the track as many spaces as the number rolled. By expending bonus points, the player may move his pawn further. Then, the player must place one building block on the board in the column or row corresponding to the space on the track where his pawn is located. If he now has the building blocks needed to support one of his platforms, he may place that platform on top of the building blocks. If he does so, he gains an amount of money based on the size of the platform and the level at which it was built.After a platform has been added, building blocks may be added on top of the platform. If another player builds on top of your platform, you gain a number of bonus points. You also gain bonus points if your pawn ends its move on a corner. If a player accumulates nine or more bonus points, he receives nine Casa Grande Lire, but loses the bonus points.The game ends at the end of the round in which a player has placed his last building block. The player who has collected the most money winsThis was a fun game that my family enjoyed. The game itself is very well made and visually appealing.My children are age 12 and older
Casa Grande is a strategic Eurogame that leans slightly more toward the element of strategy rather than luck, although not by a large margin.  People who are more inclined to enjoy chess rather than Parcheesi are more likely to be drawn toward this game.  The instructions are somewhat limited, something that might lend itself to a bit of improvisational play for more creative gamers.  The recommended age range for play is 8 to 99, however unless you have a rather precocious youngster on board, I'd up the lower age range a few notches.  The game is meant to be played by two to four players and should last approximately thirty to forty-five minutes.SKILLS PREMISE (rated by stars):** Luck*** Strategy*  Communication*  Knowledge**  Creativity**  ActionWHAT'S IN THE BOX:*  Game board*  96 Building Blocks in Four Colors*  Eight Wooden Playing Pieces in Four Colors*  One die*  Play money*  InstructionsThis is a combinatorial game with an element of chance.  The chance is in the roll of the dice which will enable the player to move his pawn forward.  The strategy is in the placement of the building blocks and the decision to move forward by using bonus points.  The game is quick, fun, and in the winner is determined in a Monopoly-like fashion by who has acquired the most money.I like the game, but the instructions could have been better.  The quality, as far as games go, is excellent.  I'd expect nothing less from anything Ravensburger, a name that I equate more with puzzles than board games.  If you are a gamer into strategy and have friends who are equally competitive I think you'll enjoy it.  If you are into straightforward games of chance with little strategy, you may wish to pass.  This is a seemingly simple game with potential for a lot of action and strategic competition given the right competitors.
"Casa Grande takes a simple premise (build big and build high) that kids can grasp and then subtly turns it into a deep exercise in strategic thinking.  The rules permit offensive or defensive styles, each of which can result in victory.  There are also numerous choices with their respective tradeoffs in each turn and it really pays off to keep thinking about both your next few moves as well as the anticipated moves of your opponents.  It works well with as few as two players, but it really gets interesting with three or four as everyone starts building right on top of one another.  The game design also generally results in close finishes, so no one feels left out after a slow start.Aside from the strategic thinking, Casa Grande also particularly educational for kids who are just getting into multiplication tables and/or doing simple math computations in their heads.  Our son really got into the ""when I make my next move, my 18 points are going to put me in the lead!"" mindset.  In this respect, it's like flash card practice without the feeling of doing homework.The game board and all pieces are of the same high quality typical of all Ravensburg products.  The board and pieces are substantial, thick cardboard or else molded plastic.  From its old world European art design to its rich color scheme, the game is also asthetically very attractive.I'd enthusiastically recommend Casa Grande for any family with kids 8+ who enjoy a good strategic board game."
This is a new game that entertained the family for hours.Somewhat like monopoly as it has money and buildings to build on, but it also adds in some math skills that can help kids learn how to multiply. If you aren't in the math mood, you can just use a calculator to add up levels and money. Young kids can enjoy building without understanding the complete object of the game. They will need help from an adult to understand placement and building rules. This game can last a long time or short depending on how you play. They suggest playing on others pieces to make the game more challenging, but if playing with young kids, you can just split up the building area for each player to build in. Nice change from the boards games we've played for years.
"My family played this together. My son loved it -- he's a big fan of the online game, ""Minecraft"" -- so he was a natural at getting into the spirit of building. My daughter was reluctant at first to play, said it looked a little boring, but began to play and enjoyed it, though not as much as my son.These games are nicely inventive and mind-expanding. I really think ""tactile"" games like this are important for families to play, since kids are getting so much 'virtual play on their computers, devices and TV. Tabletop ""board"" games are still a different and fun experience."
"A good game has simple rules that are easy to understand coupled with elements of luck and strategy.  This qualifies as a good game meeting almost all the requirements.  The game played by two to four players should not take more than an hour to win.Players move around a track based on a die roll.  The number of squares moved can be modified depending on special points.  All players start with five and must decide when to spend or accumulate them.  Your counters move lets you place a building block in that row.  Building blocks can be connected with floors, depending on selected patterns.  The more and taller buildings a player builds, the more money they collect.  The game ends when the there are no more pieces.  The player with the most money wins.The rules are not difficult to understand and the instruction book is generally good.  We did have some questions to resolve with ""house rules"".Play is not just ""roll the dice"" luck, requiring some thought of when and how to use your special points.You will need multiplication skills or a good calculator to play.  That makes me question how well children under 10 or 11 will do.Floors are cardboard making me question their life span.The other pieces are wood or plastic.The money is paper.The game lacks bright colors.  The playing pieces are a dull color and the board is mostly tan.  Building design is limited to the floor pieces provided.  This is generally sufficient although some felt this was a drawback.Overall, this is a good game for teenagers and adults that most will want to play again."
This is a strategy game. It does not take as long to learn or as long to play as some strategy games that we own.  That is a good thing for younger players and busy families. Allow two hours the first time you play as you get acquainted with the play and strategy involved. I would say that age 10 would be the youngest that could play it without getting frustrated.  It is really a game for teenagers and adults. It would be an excellent leisure activity for a Math / Geometry class to play when they wanted to take a break at some point in the semester. We enjoyed playing it.  However, I would have been a little happier if the construction part was a little sturdier because the whole playing board got a little wobbly as we added more pieces and layers. We had to be very careful when we added something to the board and still it would involve readjusting multiple other pieces.  Beyond that, I think it is a very interesting game and it would make a great gift for the teen-aged boy on your gift list.
I hadn't heard of this game before ordering it, but I'm always on the lookout for fun games that we can play with our niece when she comes over.You basically roll the die and collect pieces to build blocks.  It's a bit simple in its premise, but that made it easy for our eight-year-old niece to play. We had to help her with the multiplication and adding, though, so I think that this would be best for ages ten and over.The reason for my four stars is that it is a bit monotonous to play, and so, long term, I'm not sure how much use this will get.  It's too expensive to make it a one-time game, but so far that's all we've used it for.
This game has been played by with two adults and two children ages 6 and 9.  We love trying new games and have a rather substantial collection in place.Others have left very detailed reviews so I won't go into the mechanics.  I'd like to summarize by saying the game simply didn't capture the imaginations of either adults of the kids.The younger child did enjoy the idea of the game and quickly understood it, but the fine motor skills required to play the game were beyond him right now.  The pieces aren't very sturdy/stable so it does require good dexterity to work with that reality.If we didn't have a plethora of other games, and if this had better/more thorough instructions, this might have scored higher (four would have been highest we would go) as I think there is a segment of the gaming world that would enjoy this more than we did.  The kids have never asked to play it, and don't last long when the game is brought out.  We would not chose to play it ourselves either.I did give it four stars for educational value as I think it teaches good critical thinking skills, math and spatial relations.

This is simple game with elements of strategy with a little luck. It definitely requires decent spatial imagination, and foreseeing your moves. You have to be dynamic with your placements as what you wanted to do may not be possible to do because the other players have taken up the spot that you were looking to build on or because you did not get the die roll you were looking for. You basically place blocks on the board. Where you place the block is decided by your die roll which moves your pawn that many spaces. You can use the bonus points from the bonus point scale to add to your movement from the die roll. You earn these bonus points by collecting points as a commission if other players use your floors to build their blocks on. You can build a block of your color directly on top of yourblock. You collect points equal to the squares covered multiplied by the number of floors. You collect these points when you put a platform on your blocks. There are different platforms, T shaped, L shaped, horizontal 4 squares platforms, 3 square platforms. These different shapes along with the block traffic on the board from other players and the die rolls you get makes this is shifting strategy game where you may need to change a move that you were planning at the last minute. So there are lot of permutations and combinations that you have to keep at the back of your mind to execute based on what other players do. You do not compete as much with other players but it can get confrontational when you try to block the other player from attaining a good score by placing your blocks in the way. If you block, you need to also try to gain points in the process otherwise you lose your precious blocks and take up precious squares. Great innocuous looking game. Easy to learn, but can deal good amount of strategy. Those who have a good visual spatial ability will find it easier. Those with poor visual spatial ability will improve on their abilities. One quibble I have is the paper money. There was no need for this. You cannot use this to buy anything. The money only serves as victory points. They could have used something different for victory points. I guess the makes felt the money went thematically with the concept that you earn money as you erect these structures. Apart from these minor quibbles all else is good. And oh yes I forgot, why make the rule book without color when some of the rules depend on color for explanation. Overall decent game.
It is a bit confusing in the directions and the game play has many little things to keep track of. I am hoping that after a few more times playing it that we will get the hang of it and that it will be a fun game. For now it seems like it has potential, but that we are mostly just stumbling through it.
"As cool as this game looked, it frustrated us at first. I'm a smart guy - I write technical documents for a living, yet as with the other two Ravensburger games I played, I was very confused by a couple of subtleties in the directions. As with the other two, the game is actually pretty simple and once we started playing, we figured out where we had misinterpreted the directions. And, admittedly, for the first 10 minutes or so, we didn't quite see the appeal, as though we were still missing something, but as we continued, and the board started filling up, and we better understood the goal, and started picking up on the strategies we began to see the simple attraction of the game and we quite enjoyed it. By the end of the game, I was looking forward to another round in the near future. So my point is, if the relatively sparse instructions confuse you a bit at first, hang in there. It's really a pretty good game, The game took a while to play - close to an hour, but I think it will go faster in the future, and there is the option of playing a shorter game with fewer pieces, but the most fun is when the board starts getting full, so I'd encourage you to go for the full game.The object is to strategically place pieces that form a foundation of a building, on which you can place platforms ('floors', or 'stories') for which you get paid. The strategy is to try to build multi-floor structures as your payment is multiplied by how high the building is. You can bank bonus points that allow you to do things like alter your position on the board, 'rent' a space to build a foundation piece on another player's building, or trade for cash. Whomever has the most cash once the pieces have been played, wins.Like their other games I tried, this game will appeal to younger kids as well, but the older you are, the more complex the strategy and overall game play will be. It's also a very attractive game, but I had to mark it down for durability since the ""money"" is very flimsy and half of the playing pieces are cardboard, but they should still last many, many years if not mistreated.Give it a try, I think you'll enjoy it."
Shapes reminiscent of tetris.Players are contractors, start with no money, then get no money until they are successful as builders. Guess you use other people's money, much like real contractors.High quality materials.Did they think thru a name like Casa Grande (The Big House)it's not about building prisons.Unclear rules, needs more examples. Had to look at the box to figure out some rulesAt times we had to go to the different translations to straighten things out.Interesting game, not boring, moves fast.Can you do a flying buttress over another person's color?Need better contrast: beige and grey too close, red and orange too closeCongruent: does laying another color's  platform perpendicular across a platform make it non congruent?And it's only between adjacent levels, right?The 9+ money fooled us, we went to pick it up and it was the board.A light beer & pretzel game.  Strategy can be more complex than we thoughtYou have to watch the other guys building, gauging how soon to the end of the game.You have to watch the other guys shapes to see their options.Good for aggressive players, but, once you're behind, no chance of coming back.Towards the end of the game, one has to play standing to get a good view of the structure.
