Top question:
is the mr pencil included
Top review:
"I have twin six-year-olds and they love LeapFrog readers with LeapFrog pencils.  Typically, the pencils go over the words of the book and allow them to practice word recognition.  This LeapFrog takes the next ""leap"" and allows them to practice not just sounding out words but to spell and write words as well.  A great, fun, educational product."

Reviews:
"As an engineer, I can often sense when a product is being brought to market without having been fully tested. This is one of those products. First though, I should start with the good. Overall this is a good and educational tool. The child draws letters with the leapfrog pen, and the pen gives audio responses - it tells them when they've made the letter correctly, or corrects them when they start in the wrong place or accidentally lift the pencil up from the paper as they draw a letter. Leapfrog was also smart enough to make the pencil not actually a pencil, so it won't write on anything else other than the paper they've included (so you won't mark up the story book that comes with it as your child listens to the book).The problem is that every time the child starts a new letter, the pen gives them instructions for what to do. These instructions are the same each time and take about 15 seconds to deliver. After the child gets the hang of things, 15 seconds is an eternity to wait, so they start right away. The pen gets confused as the child moves from one step to the next without waiting for the extremely slow audio responses. This causes the pen to stop giving responses, and only defeats the purpose of using it in the first place. Even after some serious coaching to be patient, my five year old daughter usually only got through 1 or 2 letters (out of 5 or 6) each time before the pen was forced to reset itself and stopped giving responses. Then she just touched the next letter to start over and it happened again. If your child does something wrong, like not following a line to the end, the pen will start to say something like ""keep going all the way to the end of the line"", but if the child has moved on to the next line already, the pen will get cut off and the child will never hear what it's trying to say. Also the storybook is not very intuitive for a child to navigate. There is no guidance for what images to touch and which not to that makes sense to a child. This is a product which was clearly tested by adults and not by its intended audience."
My daughter is starting kindergarten next month and we've been working on writing out our letters.  She always starts out interested, but I've had a lot of trouble making it fun and keeping her engaged in the practice.  We have a Leap Pad and she's used the Mr. Pencil game many times, but always ends up frustrated because the pen is so sensitive and any bump or slight deviation and you have to start over.  This book was just what she needed!  The letters are bigger than the Leap Pad Mr. Pencil game, and the sensitivity is a little reduced.  It does still ask you to go back to the X if you go out of line too far or lift up the pen, but with bigger letters it's just easier for her to stay on track.I also love that this comes with a game and a story to help make it fun.  The story follows some stick figures who are trying to start a band for the Doodlebug Fair. The descriptions for the curlicue and straight letters are so cute, and had my daughter giggling more than a few times.This is a great set for any child to practice their letters and get comfortable writing upper and lower case.  It's fun and engaging, and now my daughter actually wants to practice her kindergarten writing!
This is not our first LeapFrog product, and will not be the last. My daughter had had so much fun with this new product and playing with the included dinosaurs game as well as writing. Keep in mind that she is 4 and had been improving so much on how she write letters.Thanks leapfrog
"My soon to be kindergartener needs much practice with writing letters. I found this book quite helpful and fun. He enjoys the story and the interactive ""learning pencil"". The ""magic paper"" is neat. With using the pen, the letters ""magically appear"". The pen is a bit thicker than a normal writing instrument but this is a minimal distraction to the letter learning process. Each bag has a variety of activities--writing, tracing, reading or listening to the story. The book is compact enough to toss in a bag for on the go play. Great for kid friendly restaurants or car travel.We also have a leapfrog tag reader. I would consider this an upgrade for several reasons. The pen has more functions (play, fwd and remind buttons). It is easier to listen to stories with the pen, because the buttons allow for easy functioning. This newer pen is also sleeker."
"The letters in this book aren't done in order. If you're wanting this book to teach letters, that might be important to know. I've chosen to teach in order, and am working on that with my two oldest. (I know some teach letters out of order, which is great, too) Either way, with this book they're learning letters. Plus, there's an alphabet chart on the last page that does put the letters in the correct order. It seems as though the letters in this book are introduced according to how easy they are to write(straight lines, curves, etc). So, as your child goes along, the letters get harder and harder to write.Also, both uppercase and lowercase letters are included in this book.Each page in the book has a little practice sheet. These sheets are super sensitive to pressure. Any pressure at all from any source, and a ""pencil"" mark will show up where you've written. Once you've used these sheets, they are useless. (You can't erase) You are provided with an extra set of sheets, and given the warning to NOT stack and to separate them before writing. When your little one is done with the sheets, they can be easily torn out, and the book will work perfectly fine without them. Your child can still practice ""writing"" letters just using the book.Since music is an important part of this book's story, I enjoyed that added lesson for my little ones. There's even a piano included that can be played, which makes me like this book even more.Overall, this is a wonderful tool to have for learning! I'm looking forward to adding the numbers book to our library soon!"
We have been using Tag books since my child was pretty young. I was so excited to see this Learn to Write book as its just perfect for her age. What I love most is that its a big book and full of educational value. Some of the other books are so short you dont get much value or time out of them. This one is more interactive it it guides you through the fundamentals of writing and its done in a way thats fun, interesting and portable. The binding is a super smart feature and pages are thick and sturdy. Not only is it a great introduction to letters, she enjoys reading the words and all silly noises. This book has it all and is a good value.
We have really enjoyed the Tag pen and books and were excited to try out the new LeapReader pen and this book. At first the LeapReader pen seemed very similar to the Tag pen but then I discovered the subtle, yet cool differences. For example, the LeapReader pen can write on special LeapFrog paper. This use is great for a book like this one that is teaching kids to write their letters and the best part is there is no mess.I really enjoy this interactive book (and so did my daughter) and would have given it 5 stars, but I think it should come with more learning paper (the pages the kids can actually write on with their pen, that you can then tear out of the book). If your child is learning to write their letters, I think this is a fun way to reinforce proper letter formation and to practice. I sit with my daughter as she goes through this book because I really want her to get the most out of the learning paper pages, instead of just racing through them.
"Since we got this a few weeks ago, it's been, hands down, the most popular toy/device in the house. And I've managed to keep it together (mostly)! The letter-writing element is good, as are the other educational aspects, but I've found that my five year-old mostly likes to play the ""game"" on each page of the sample book. Well, not each page at this point: just the Scooby Doo page. For, it seems like, hours on end (though it's probably only about 30 minutes at a shot). As can be expected, your milage may vary with this sort of thing.It's a good product, but my 5yo doesn't seem to have the patience to sit through the audio books, so I'm not sure if they add much value. All in all, though, she's getting a lot out of it, and really likes playing and hopefully learning with the LeapReader."
I generally feel that LeapFrog makes quality products and this is no exception. My pre-schooler loves to practice his writing. I found the writing games engaging and it easy to use overall. I would caution folks that the practice pages are very sensitive to pressure. Use one at a time rather than stacking them. Although there are many apps that allow letter tracing practice I can only assume that the added benefit of holding a writing implement has to help. Overall quality product.
"This product works incredibly well out of the box (after initial charging). It was my first experience with a LeapFrog product. The pen has a sort of optical recognition feature so it knows not only what page you are on, but where on that page you touch. It is very engaging. It offers three modes: audiobooks, music, and trivia challenges. Switching the mode is toggled by the home button. Which mode you are in is indicated by color and oral feedback. In audiobook mode, it can read the book to you, or one word at a time (the word that you touch). It can also sound out individual letters. There are volume control buttons and a headphone jack. Overall, I am very impressed with the product.The writing book includes carbonless writing paper so that children can practice writing letters. The ""pencil"" is not actually a real pencil that can write on any paper. I tested it thoroughly before handing it over to the true end user: a very smart 2.5 year old who just so happens is very interested in letters at the moment. My conclusion is that she's probably still too young for this educational toy. She is most fascinated by the color changing light by pressing the home button repeatedly. I have demonstrated the pencil's capabilities in reading and writing. She is highly interested but can't seem to operate the pencil with the same ease I was able to do. Perhaps it's the angle at which she is holding it, or she is lacking pressure on the page. We will keep trying!The LeapFrog connect software isn't the most user friendly. The first time I used it, I inadvertently cleared all the content the device came with. It ""syncs"" every time you click to download companion audio for new books, which is a slow process. I would prefer to just add things to a cart and sync everything at once. But overall, I am thrilled with this product and recommend it to early readers and writers."
"the pen, that is. And if you miss the letter more than an acceptable amount, it says to start over at the red X.  This is a very useful practice when you are teaching children letters because the pen knows, the pen knows!  It sees all!""Learn to write letters"" is very interesting.  The story line is simple and tends to go off in many directions, which is fine for little children who often have short attention spans.  There is a practice directly on the heavy weight pages of the book and that combines learning with a physical activity - this is the best way to encourage learning.This book also has a smaller side page for additional practice and it can be torn out of the spiral notebook when finished.I always find LeapFrog's tone of voice and way of correcting to be very pleasant but grating after awhile.  Children don't seem to mind it though.  They just go back to the red X to start over.Our 4 year-old granddaughter is far more interested in this than our 5 year-old was initially.  She loves all things LeapFrog and wanted to dive right in.  I had to tell her to wait to charge the Leap Reader pen first. Lucky it was a fast charge because she sat on my lap watching it and cleaning out my top desk drawer.  (It did NOT need cleaning out, not at that point anyway.)She also pointed out that she has one of these, the LeapFrog Tag reader at home.  She insisted they were the same.  I was trying to figure out the difference and it is the writing side of this - the practice of writing letters.  The tag system identified words and read books.As for the age groups, our 4 year-old liked it best,  the 5 year-old liked it sort of, and the 8 year old saw his brother and sister playing with it but demonstrated no interest whatsoever."
First of all, I used this product with my 3 yr old granddaughter, a bit younger than the targeted age.  She already uses LeapFrog products, so I was confident that this would also have appeal.I was not wrong.While she has the LeapFrog tablet thing, she had not ever used the pen-like product with the books.  She loves books, she loves pens, and she loves being independent, so I was fairly sure this would interest her.  Her first experience had her enthralled for nearly two hours, and anyone who spends time with toddlers and preschoolers knows...that's a great product.  She can't help but learn while using it, it's well written material.  She just thinks she's having fun, and the educational part is secondary, the way it should be at this stage.For the downside...and there always is one.This isn't a product to hand a child and walk off.  It's not made to be a babysitter.  It's also not designed as solely a toy, which means it's not going to take abuse or being tossed into a toy box.  Most of the books are regular paper, although this particular book has sturdier board-like pages.  The practice paper is a separate pad, and I assume that refills are available.  (I haven't checked yet.)  This is one of those things that requires parental attention while it is in use, and is best with undivided parental attention while its being used.I think it is a wonderful product, and so does the pre-schooler.  I think it will do a great deal towards preparing her for school as well.
The experience of writing letters over the guide lines is interesting. Mr Pencil is adorable with his encouragement after we finish writig the letters on a page. But for the pat on the back, you have to remember to tap on the star in the circle to let him know when you are done.The characters and illustrations are simple and creative with letters on the trampoline. After the letters sound by themselves, in a word, there's more texture to this exercise with a bit of music. This makes learning a lot of fun. If you have used tag reader, this is one step further with the writing abilities.Wish many languages came this way, so grown ups can learn foreign languages this way. Especially in this age when immigrant families struggle to teach their native language to kids, we can atleast glean some lessons from this system to make learning languages fun.
The LeapFrog LeapReader Book: Learn to Write Letters with Mr. Pencil is great for pre-schoolers learning the basics reading and writing. I have a daughter who is going on 3-years old, a bit below the recommended age for this book, but we have already subjected her to the basics of reading and writing. The LeapFrog LeapReader Book: Learn to Write Letters with Mr. Pencil reinforces those efforts by actually letting them do the actual chore of reading and writing as they browse the book. It also enhances their memory-recall ability by playing simple games where they are to match a sound to a particular appearance of an animal. The pages of the book are clear and the illustrations are colorful and they characters look fun, sure way of enticing a pre-schooler to look at the book and examine it more closely. Of course, adult supervision is still needed to make sure that they just don't draw away or do the wrong things but I was mildly suprised how easily a pre-schooler can comprehend the illustrations and the activities in this book at first glance. This is another great product from LeapFrog that invokes learning and fun at the same time.
LeapFrog's New LeapReader pen (not included) can function as a pencil on the new pressure sensitive paper by LeapFrog. So LeapFrog has made a book teaching children to write all the letters of the alphabet on ruled lines. First the child traces (in the appropriate order) the lines for each letter. Then they move onto writing it on their own. The pen gives them feedback which is generally helpful, making sure that the child writes each stroke of the letter in the appropriate way and in the appropriate order.In addition to the letter tracing pages, the book includes story and activity pages, that my daughter did not find very fun. But these pages are not the point of the book, so I will overlook them and still give it a 5-star rating.Thankfully, additional tracing pages are included, which is nice. Now that my daughter has finished the book, when I notice that she is having a hard time writing a letter, I can find a blank tracing page for that letter and let her practice again.I was so impressed that I purchased theLeapFrog LeapReader Book: Learn to Write Numbers with Mr. Pencilwhich is also good.
LeapReader (and its predecessor, the TagReader) is a great system for kids to interact with books in the years where reading skills are emerging. And this product is a fascinating way to teach writing. It has two main components, woven together in one book. The book has the usual and durable tag pages, where kids can follow characters and trace letter forms as they learn capital and lower-case letters. But it also contains, interspersed with those pages, white writing pages, which are pressure sensitive, so the reading wand actually writes on the paper, so the kids can see exactly what they've done. It works just like a pencil would. So this makes a great way for emerging writers to go from making rough letter shapes by tracing shapes on the tag pages to tracing on paper to free-form writing on paper. The wand itself may be a little hard for some kids to manipulate, but my five year olds have been able to write with it very naturally and don't seem phased by its bulk when they write.The pages are collected in a lay-flat spiral binding that makes it easy to manipulate. As with all the LeapReader products, it is well designed for kids. The kit also comes with a bunch of additional writing pages, so once kids have written on the pages bound into the book, the fun can still continue. This is another great product in the Tag/LeapReader system. My kids have spent hours with these. (Both my five year olds and my two year old have enjoyed this and all of the Tag/LeapReader products.) So much better than video games! Highly recommended.
My son is a reluctant writer.  He does not like to practice his letters and numbers, so this entertaining educational package was just what we needed.  The story was entertaining, and the new paper that allows the pen to work like a pencil is really cool.  Not only can he practice tracing, he can also practice writing.  It also comes with additional paper for when the ones attached to the book are used.  Overall, I think this is a fun way to practice writing letters.
I love all of these characters, and so does my daughter.  This is all very creative, and she is learning to write her letters pretty quickly.
We bought our daughter the Tag reader pen a year ago. So she was familiar with how the Tag reader system works.The new LeapReader adds the writing functionality to the pen system. As a reader, it works the same way the Tag reader did.Although our preschooler already knew how to write the alphabets, this book helps her practice her writing skills. It has great fun games that require writing alphabets.I would highly recommend the LeapReader system and this book. They are intelligently designed to help kids learn to read and write.
"LOVED IT!several of my kids tried this book out with the LeapReaderand once again LeapFrog comes through with a terrific product!!We LOVE LeapFrog have had many of their products over the yearsand seems they just keep inventing new updated ways to learn and play for the modern day child.Love it has both upper and lower case letters to work onThe letter are not ""taught"" in order in this story bookthis is more to enhance what you are already learningso for us it is totally fine not in order and i like it that way for uswe have never taught in order since sometimes they will skip over letters that are harder to learnthat is why this book was perfect for them to work withthe sheets are a one time use onlyand be sure to listen when they tell youDO NOT STACK the sheets!if you do then the sheet under the one you are using will become useless from the pressure points on the sheet above itonly one sheet at a time and try to be careful not to get any marks on the sheets before useand once you do use the sheets you can not use them againbut that is ok you can just rip them out of the book and you can still practice the motion with just the bookwe loved the piano in the book too"
We're in the process of building motor skills for our soon-to-be kindergartner, and this product is excellent for pencil work and line drawing. Mr. Pencil was an instant favorite! And so is the magic paper inside (the magic paper makes Mr. Pencil write like a real pencil to practice the letters).In addition, the pencil reads through the story books - either as follow-along or word-by-word point reading. It's an excellent learning resource on many levels. My seven-year-old even gets play/reading practice in with it and really enjoys using the program. I highly recommend this for young and early readers.
As a long-time lover of LeapFrog products this is another great product!  The kids love it and fight over whose turn it is to use it.  : )It's similar to the Tag System, but much more advanced because of the writing integration. This is really is a big improvement over the Tag reading system. The pen teaches writing and correct stroke order. I love that the device is rechargeable via USB port, instead of using batteries. This cuts down on the expense of batteries. My kids can sound out each word, they can read along as the pen moves across each sentence, or they can have the story read to them, but now they can also write with the LeapReader's special paper.  My kids have found the pen so easy to use and we are really happy with it!
"LeapFrog has always been a favorite of mine. My special needs son used many of their products years ago growing up, starting with the original LeapReader. My daughter is now old enough and this Mr. Pencil, Learn to Write Letters is an Excellent Book.For those that know LeapFrog, - Mr. Pencil, Dot and Dash are the characters that guide you through the book. Your child is asked to trace the letters. The book keeps the alphabet out of order as you go through it, and at the end has all the letters lower case and capital in alphabetical order. They associate the letter you trace with something your child can remember.. such as curved letter ""C"" or a lower case ""l"" falling down.. each letter has something associated with it, that helps the reader understand how to trace over it and associate it with something to remember it. My daughter is doing great with the book.There is a musical story line as you go through the book as well. And best of all (my favorite) there is a 25 note activity keyboard. You can actually play a song, hitting one note at a time. Very cool! Its my daughters favorite part.There are repetitive games throughout and a quiz at the end. Great product!"
LeaoFrog is one of the best educational brand on the market today. The LeapFrog LeapReader Book Learn to Write Letters with Mr. Pencil is a great way to teach children to write. The book is very durable and will provide hours of fun and also a great teaching aid.
I got this set for my 4 (young) for year old b/c we've had difficulty teaching her how to write her letters.  The book is a lot of fun. It has AMAZING educational value-it requires the child to listen to the story, identify the characters they are talking about, apply that knowledge by touching it with the special pen, and then they practice writing the letters/lines, etc. It is good for preschoolers, but I would think that kids who already know how to write would be pretty bored by the first 1/4 of the book, as it starts with drawing just straight lines.My only complaint about this book is that once you practice on the drawing pages, you cannot clear them off in any way b/c they are the carbon pressure paper.  You can used it again and the pen will still give you the appropriate instructions, but the lines from previous times remain on the page.Overall, I think this set is very neat and I really love how it makes learning a fun game, rather than a chore!
"I have twin six-year-olds and they love LeapFrog readers with LeapFrog pencils.  Typically, the pencils go over the words of the book and allow them to practice word recognition.  This LeapFrog takes the next ""leap"" and allows them to practice not just sounding out words but to spell and write words as well.  A great, fun, educational product."
"The LeapReader Learn to write Letters with Mr. Pencil includes paper practice pages inside the book, as well as a separate alphabet letters Practice Pack. There is a sheet for each letter, and each letter includes an upper and lowercase practice line. The waxy pages are nice and thick, ensuring they hold up after multiple sessions of use. The practice pages, however, are thin like origami paper and can tear easily. Most pages have a read along, game, repeat and stop option and include a variety of interactive activities within the story line itself or learning and tracing numbers, letters, squiggly or strait lines.Both my boys enjoyed this and there were only some negatives along the way with both my 4 year old and my 7 year old. With my youngest, he tried to trace the letters but since he did not accurately stay within the lines for tracing purposes, or even properly touch the small red X at the top for each letter (they teach you proper letter writing form), the pen did not pick up that he even tried and kept asking him to start at the red X. After 3 attempts of trying to please the ""instructor"", frustration became known, so I had him continue with the story line and do the line/shape drawings, instead of the numbers and letters. It's something that he will be able to come back to when he is more steadier with his hands. My oldest however, could trace properly and do the numbers,  but he thought the pictures and the story line was too babyish and was disappointed on how fast the paper ran out. Replacements are available, but need to be purchased separately. What this book really needed was a reusable paper pad."
Leapfrog consistently makes great learning products for children, all while making the child feel like they are just playing a fun game.  This particular product features some familiar LeapReader characters such as Mr. Pencil, Dot, and Dash.My child is not yet 3 1/2 years old, so she is a few months shy of the minimum recommended age of 4 years.  She enjoys playing with this, but I have to sit right with her and help guide her hand.  She doesn't quite have the hand/eye coordination yet that is necessary for a product like this.  I have decided to put this away for a few months, until she is closer to the recommended age.  Given the features of this product, I think she will quickly learn to write her letters when she is a few months older.  I definitely recommend this product, but only if your child actually meets the minimum age requirement.
We had recently bought our 4 (almost 5) year old son the Tag Reader, when we got the chance to use this new one which had the additional writing recognition.  I've got to say, this new systems is heads and tails above the other.  The pen is very easy for a child to hold and operate, and is inutiative.  This particular book has the special writing paper interspersed between the story, where children can practice writing.  My only complaint is that once you have used the paper, that's it...there is no way to refill it.  However, you can buy extra paper and have them practice outside of the book.My now 5 year old son is very eagerly grabbing for this system and loves to play the games embedded in the pages.
Leapfrog rarely disappoints me and this is no different.  My 5 year old loves it and I think the key to learning is fun (especially at this age).  If you are not enjoying your learning, you will not choose to play with the item.  All the Leapfrog products that I have seem to accomplish this and this book is right in line with it.  Used it extensively and asked to use again later in week.  Worth the money!
"This book stars some standard LeapReader characters--Dot, Dash, and Mr. Pencil. Dot and Dash are trying to get a band together to perform at the Doodleburg Fun Fair. Throughout the course of the book, the story details their efforts to find such performers as a piano player and singer.Along the way, the reader is asked to trace letters. The letters are included in memorable ways. For example, a lower-case ""l"" is falling down like a water balloon. ""C"" and ""U"" are curved, and mimic sheep skateboarding! The letters being out of alphabetical order may be a concern for some parents, but they're also included on page 42 in order, with upper- and lower-case.The games are mostly repetitive, with the main two being:(1) A memory/matching game where a varying character appears in eight poses that all have different sounds attached to them.(2) A few letters/illustrations grouped together--each having its own sounds--that can be clicked on in any order and, when done, the ""pen"" repeats the little diddy created.The most impressive activity is a two-octave keyboard on page 7, complete with black keys (sharps and flats), for a total of 25 notes! Songs can really be played on this keyboard, one note at a time. This inclusion left me wishing they had done something this creative with other instruments, too, but a piano is straightforward by being chromatic.There's also a quiz at the very end, to test reading comprehension.The paper that comes with the book is temporary--once used, it can't be used again. It's basically pressure-sensitive. For example, a fingernail run across it will leave a mark. There's nothing magic about the LeapReader ""pen"" in connection with the paper--it just has a point that adds enough pressure to the pressure-sensitive paper to leave a mark. Thankfully, the book comes with some extra pages and can can be used without them. Also, this paper is completely unneeded and can be ripped out of the book. Once it's used up, it's not a big deal since the letters can be traced in the book as well--it's just that no marks will show up.The book's theme is in line with other LeapFrog writing products, and is similar to how PetPad works (on a separate product, the LeapPad)."
"Doodleburg rocks with Mr. Pencil to teach your 4-8 year-old upper- and lower-case letters, handwriting, and letter sounds.  The paper included is pressure sensitive like the second page of duplicate checks, so your child will most likely need supervision to get the full value out of this book.  Also, there are included pages on which writing can be done...once.  The book itself has pages that are aware of what is happening on which you can ""write.""  The story is OK, but the charm definitely comes from being able to tap the pen and hear different things depending on where you tap.  I'm sure this would be highly educational and fun, depending on the story, for younger kids.  My 7-year-old found this particular story somewhat ""easy."""
"I've been curious about LeapFrog products and was excited to try this!  It looks like a really great way to teach letters to kids!  It comes with an electronic pen that works with the TAG system.  For some reason, I thought it was going to look like a big pencil, but this wasn't the case!  Anyway, you go through the book and it has you practice writing letters on special pressure-sensitive paper.  This paper can only be used once!  And since it's pressure sensitive, be sure to only use one sheet at a time!!!  So be forewarned, you will need to buy more paper or eventually use the book without paper - it will still work!I did have some trouble figuring out how to use all this stuff, maybe because I'm new to LeapReader!  I got this through the Amazon Vine program, and they sent me the book and the ""magic pen"" which is the electronic component.  For some reason, I thought it would come with an electronic platform for the book to sit on, like the LittleTouch LeapPad.  This is not the case!  This is just a book and an electronic pen (sold separately).  I think Amazon or LeapFrog also loaded some extra stuff or games on because the container was sliced open and the pen had been replaced, but I honestly have no clue how to access it!  I can't take stars away from the product for this.  It's still a great product and wonderful tool to teach kids letters!"
