Top question:
Does this work with the Leapad ultra xdi
Top review:
My daughter loves watching Doc McStuffins. I was thrilled to be able to get her a copy of this game.My daughter just turned 3 and has a LeapPad and a LeapPad Ultra as well. I like that the cartridge is compatible with both devices. My daughter has had this for several weeks now and request that the game be in her LeapPad so she can play it. At first I thought it might be a little too advanced for her but she is able to navigate around the game and knows more about the game than I do. There is a part when you have to fill a pitcher up to a certain line. I kept using the stylus, she told me I was doing to wrong. You literally pour the LeapPad over and it pours the liquid into the pitcher. Felt a bit small being corrected by a 3 year old. It also lets you picks patients out of the waiting room and you can assist with the exam and fix the patient.I think what I love most about Doc McStuffins is my daughter is no longer afraid of going to the Doctor. After playing the game and knowing that the Doctor is there to help and not hurt, my daughter is actually excited about going to her Doctor visit next week. She used to be scared but Doc McStuffins is a great show and game that helps your kids understand that Doctors are there to help.My daughter really likes this game. Just today she was asking for it because it was not in her LeapPad. I think this would make a great Christmas gift for any child who has a LeapPad and loves the show. It is perfect!

Reviews:
My daughter loves watching Doc McStuffins. I was thrilled to be able to get her a copy of this game.My daughter just turned 3 and has a LeapPad and a LeapPad Ultra as well. I like that the cartridge is compatible with both devices. My daughter has had this for several weeks now and request that the game be in her LeapPad so she can play it. At first I thought it might be a little too advanced for her but she is able to navigate around the game and knows more about the game than I do. There is a part when you have to fill a pitcher up to a certain line. I kept using the stylus, she told me I was doing to wrong. You literally pour the LeapPad over and it pours the liquid into the pitcher. Felt a bit small being corrected by a 3 year old. It also lets you picks patients out of the waiting room and you can assist with the exam and fix the patient.I think what I love most about Doc McStuffins is my daughter is no longer afraid of going to the Doctor. After playing the game and knowing that the Doctor is there to help and not hurt, my daughter is actually excited about going to her Doctor visit next week. She used to be scared but Doc McStuffins is a great show and game that helps your kids understand that Doctors are there to help.My daughter really likes this game. Just today she was asking for it because it was not in her LeapPad. I think this would make a great Christmas gift for any child who has a LeapPad and loves the show. It is perfect!
My granddaughter is intrigued by Doc McStuffins and during recent visits to the doctor and the emergency room we have been able to talk about the visits in the context of the show.She is also a Leap Pad fan and this game, while young for her (she is age 7), is fun because she can do check ups on the animals just like the real Doc McStuffins.A lot of the games that are age-appropriate require a bit more parental supervision, and I enjoy being able to have her play this one without my constant attention.
My daughter is a huge Doc McStuffins fan, and she was so excited to play this.  In the game, you help Doc with observation and her tools much the same way that you see in the show.  Once her patients are all feeling better, she sends out the helicopter, also from the show, out to look for more toys.  When a toy feels better, the diagnosis goes in the Big Book of Boo-Boos.My daughter is four, almost five, and while she had a lot of fun playing it, it didn't hold her attention for long.  There aren't really any math or reading puzzles, which I think would have made the game even better and broadened the age range.  I do like that Doc gives kids a health lesson after each game.All in all, it's very cute and would be perfect for younger kids.
Doc McStuffins is one of the most popular shows on Disney Junior. The Doc McStuffins Learning game for the Leap Pad is very true to the game - including the original open sequence and song. The game itself is a bit low on &#34;learning&#34; but it will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with the show.Notes -- Has two modes - a game mode and a feature that allows you to design bad aids- The game mode features your little diagnosing each of Doc's toys. Some of the diagnoses are basic but they are not always very intuitive (all some of them are).- For the most part children over the age of 3 should be able to play most of the features - although ages over 4 shouldn't have nay issues.Final Verdict - The Doc McStuffins Leaning game may be a bit basic for older kids, but fans of Doc McStuffins will enjoy helping Doc perform check-ups on the various toys from the show. Children who have never watched Doc will probably be a bit confused at the storyline but will likely be enjoyed.4 1/2 Stars
My kids, ages 4 and 6 enjoy the Doc McStuffins show, so they were excited when we got this game. The game is similar to the show where Doc diagnoses patients and then treats them. Mixed in are opportunities for the player to help with mini-game like sewing up a rip, spotting a difference or putting events in order. By playing this, kids are introduced to basic medical vocabulary like diagnosis, patients and treatment.Like most LeapFrog products there are little educational tidbits here and there mixed in with entertainment, including basic health and hygiene tips like having your parent wash out scrapes and taking baths regularly.
My 5 year old loves this game.  She plays it on her leap pad 2 every night before bed and shows me how she is treating the poor sick animals.  Her enjoyment alone is worth a 5 star rating.
I hesitated to pick this item up because my son is 6 and I figured he&#8217;d be too old for it.  I&#8217;m honestly not sure how much school type education he&#8217;s getting from it, but he has really enjoyed the game.  He loves caring for the sick animals and I most of like how some of the learning isn&#8217;t math, reading etc.  It&#8217;s compassion, caring for others, problem solving,  and learning health related lessons.  This is big change from other learning based games and I see that as a big plus. So, even though he&#8217;s technically outside the 3-5 year age range, he&#8217;s having fun and learning about things like hygiene and, let&#8217;s face it, most 6 year old boys don&#8217;t care that much about things like hand washing!
I think the perfect age for this may be your 3.5 to 4 year olds.  If they love Doc McStuffins, they will love this game.  It worked ok with my LeapPad Ultra. . . it was a little glitchy, but I think my LeapPad needs a system update.  It is a really cute game.  You give a checkup to each toy and have to help fix them up.  My almost 3 yr old had a little trouble and could not play independently but it is definitely a game he will grow into.
My daughter has watched the TV show in the past and knew all the characters in the game, which made it more interesting to her.  It's fun to watch her interacting with the game and LeapPad.  I limit my daughter's screen time on the whole (TV, iPad, LeapPad, etc.), but I'm usually a bit more lax when I see her playing with the LeapPad.  She's been playing the Doc McStuffins game since she got it almost a month ago.  She has several other LeapPad games, but this one is currently gets played more often in the rotation, at least for now.  She enjoys designing her own band aid too and is excited when new designs are unlocked based on her achievements.  I just wish that the cartridge games weren't so expensive.  I think $20 and under is pretty fair, but above that is really asking a lot.  I'm sure that licensing the characters from the studios can get pricey, but the cost certainly prevents us from buying games more frequently.
Both our kids (ages 3 and 6) have a Leap Pad 2 so we have experienced a lot of the available games. If you have a Doc McStuffins fan in the house they will love this game. The age range (preschool to kindergarten) of the show matches right up with the game. Your future Doctor can fly around collecting toys with booboos to diagnose and treat, use the bandaid art studio to create fun bandages, and learn the same type of health and hygiene lessons you find on the show. I tend to be a little dubious of the games made to go along with a movie or tv show because sometimes the learning level is not as high, but I am totally pleased with the game. My preschooler absolutely loves it, and my frist grader enjoys taking his turn with the cartridge sometimes as well.
This game is as adorable and entertaining as the cartoon.  My 4 year old tester seemed to enjoy helping Doc McStuffin's and seemed to grasp how to play the game rather quickly.  There are a number of levels that are different and new, so the game doesn't seem stale.  This game works in all LeapPad learning tablets, as well as LeapsterGS and Leapster Explorer.  It is suggested for ages 3-5.  It seemed just right for my 4 year old!
"While my favorite part of the Doc McStuffins show is when the mom answers her phone with ""Yes, this is Doctor McStuffins,"" my children are more excited about the visits Doc McStuffins makes to her clinic to treat damaged toys.  This game centers around that part of the show.  You can help toys get fixed up and there is a lot of emphasis on hygiene, which I didn't expect, but it makes sense.  It adds some variety to our LeapPad games lineup.  Unfortunately, my kids don't seem to like this game as much as some others.  They usually play this game for only 5 to 10 minutes at a time.  Some of the interface could be more intuitive.  Still, the production quality is good and while there is not a huge amount of content, there are plenty of things to do .  I agree with the recommended ages of 3-5."
My two daughters have been big fans of Doc McStuffins for awhile. We were glad to see that Leapfrog finally was able to bring it to the LeapPad platform.When you first enter the game, the menu offers the following options: Big Box of bandages, badges, micromods, theme song, and play mode. I'll outline each one below.Big box of bandages - This section allows your child to create their own custom bandages. They can customize colors, add stamps, and other designs. They can then save those bandages, and that this same section of the game allows your child apply those bandages to a teddy bear.Badges - As you play the game, you earn badges throughout the game. There are 26 badges that you can earn.Micromods - This is pretty standard section for most cartridge games, and allows you to add more &#34;features&#34; to the game for free. It involves plugging in the LeapPad to your computer, and downloading them via LeapFrog Connect. Doc McStuffins offers 4 micromods, a penguin stamp in the bandage art studio, new main menu design, a new tool for Doc's clinic, and a new pattern in the art studio.Theme Song - This is fun for your kids. It basically plays the show's introduction video with the theme song.Play - Play mode first has you be Rescue Rhonda to go outside to locate toys that need help in Doc's clinic. The kids end up having to tap stars, hearts, and other things for Rhonda to pickup. The game then shows Rhonda landing back in Doc's clinic, and your child goes through each toy to diagnose what is wrong with each toy. After doing so, you help Doc fix the problem. This involves usually tracing something on the screen, moving toy parts to another part of the screen, or choosing what technique (i.e. brushing teeth) would solve the problem.Overall, it's definitely a game. There isn't as much eduction as I've come to expect with Leapfrog games. Really the only things that I found educational were the information about what kids should do to solve problems. That is nice, but, I was hoping for a bit more.
My 4-year-old daughter loves to play with toy doctor sets, so I figured she&#8217;d enjoy this game. She has the Leapster Explorer with Disney Tangled, Earth Adventures, and Pencil Saves Doodleburg. I was surprised how quickly she picked up Doc McStuffins. With her other games, I had to walk her through most parts, but with this one she figured out everything on her own. Not only that, but she had so much fun that she begged to play it the next day. The story mode keeps her entertained and the tasks are simple enough to understand. And because she is only doctoring toys, there&#8217;s no gory parts to worry about. I feel confident letting her spend time playing it on her own, and so far, it appears to be her favorite Leapster Explorer game to date.
"My son is just shy of his third birthday, and when I ordered this game, it was with him in mind. He was not at all familiar with the Doc McStuffins character previous to owning this game, but he absolutely loves it. When he first got the game, a few weeks ago, he had difficulty following the commands. But as he's played over and over, he's slowly gotten better at following the verbal directions given by the characters from the game.There are a couple of games that he particularly enjoys on the Doc McStuffins cartridge. One is a game where Doc is giving ""check ups"" to toys. The waiting room is full of toys in various conditions, and the kid clicks on them, and they are brought back to the doctor's office. Here, the player is told to ""click on the magnifying glass and drag it all around the toy."" When they hit the right spot, the screen sort of stops and Doc says, ""I have a diagnosis."" She then gives the kid a direction, usually using the stylus or a finger, so that he can ""fix"" the toy. When my son first started playing this, he was constantly asking for help. But now he can do it on his own, and I can see the pride in his little face when it lights up as he gets the diagnosis and as he ""cures"" the patient.The other game my son loves is one where Doc sends out a little helicopter to look for more patients. As it flies a path, there are hearts, stars, and injured toys to pick up along the way. Again, the stylus or a finger can be used. It's nice because it offers kids a chance at real success and, again, I can see his hand/eye coordination improving as he gets better and better with the stylus.There is another game which asks kids to trace letters. My son hasn't really started writing beyond a few scribbles on a page, but I see growth here, too. He's learning to hold the stylus more like a pencil, and, although it can be frustrating for him at times, he's learning how to connect the dots to create letters.I do have to admit that the game can get annoying at times. It pretty much ""talks"" constantly. But fortunately, there's a volume control on the LeapPad2 and my son is pretty good at using it (though like any kids, he doesn't always listen the first time around). And just the fact that it's reinforcing his letters (which he mostly recognizes on sight already) is good for him.While she recognizes that this is below her level, my 7-year-old daughter also enjoys playing with the Doc McStuffins game. It allows her to make use of her observational skills and ""help"" the injured toys as well."
This is a very cute little game that stars Doc McStuffins the popular Disney cartoon. I have watched it on Disney. The game opens with the show tune. When Doc sees a patient the child helps find out what is wrong, if there is a cut and stuffing is coming out Doc sews it closed and the child uses the stylus to follow dotted lines and magically the wound closes. After the toy is well they take time to tell the child what they need to do if they get sick or hurt and how an adult or doctor will makes them better.Rhonda the helicopter goes and picks up toys and the child has to guide it to pick up hearts and stars. You can design your own bandages. There are lessons on hand washing and basic good health.Very good for 3 to 5 yr olds, I am an adult and even enjoyed checking it out and know any children at my house can play and there be no concerns of content. All very positive.
"Bottom line is, this was a big hit with my child. To me it seemed a bit more repetitive (less content) than some other LeapFrog Explorer games. Really I think this is because it's aimed at a younger target audience than some of the others; 3-5 does seem accurate for this one. It also has less specifically ""educational"" content than some others, but it's interactive and has them problem solving.There's nothing especially ""girly"" about the premise of doctoring up injured toys, but the game (like the show it's based on) does seem primarily aimed at girls. Not so much that my son didn't enjoy it, but if you're selecting for a boy who's worried about things being ""girly"" then this is not your best bet.It's a sure hit for children who are fans of the TV show, but can easily be enjoyed by kids who have never seen it as well."
LeapFrog Explorer Learning Game: Disney Doc McStuffins. This is a fun and learning game for ages 3-5 years. Our 3 year old grand daughter enjoys the Bandage art studio and learned very fast how to do it herself. She needs a little help on Doc's clinic, our 5 and 7 year old grand son and daughter did not need any help at all. These games help teach them good health habits, eye hand co-ordination, puzzle solving and figuring things out. The children can earn badges during the games and connect the leapfrog to your computer and receive new stamps and colors for your bandages.
5 Stars for the LeapFrog Doc McStuffins Game! We are a HUGE fan of this show in our house, so much so that as soon as I saw this I had to get it to play with our youngest niece with. She&#8217;s 3 and loves the show and her Leapster so this was the perfect fit!It&#8217;s filled with problem solving skills that are perfect for her age. She loves to take care of her stuffed animals too helping to do the checkups and take care of the toys is twofold - taking care of her things and herself.It&#8217;s very educational but it&#8217;s hidden extremely well so the kids don&#8217;t see it as learning, only playing which is always awesome! The graphics are just like the show which is another huge plus for this fantastic LeapFrog game.
My daughter really likes Doc McStuffins, so this game was right up her alley. But, even if your child doesn't know the show or characters, I believe they would still find it to be a fun game. The fun game ties in problem solving, reasoning and logical skills, and also health. It's great for kids aged 3-7. Some of the games are very easy for the younger kids to do. This game works with LeapPad Ultra, LeapPad2 Power, LeapPad2, LeapPad1, LeapsterGS and Leapster Explorer learning game systems.It's a lot of fun and I definitely recommend it!
I got this game for my 4 year old daughter.  Doc is a favorite in our house right now.  It's a fun game-you help Doc fix up toys and have to be able to listen to instructions, identify her tools, and use fine motor skills to actually use the tools (IE to sew up a toy, etc.) It also has a part within the game that lets you design your own bandages, but it's pretty limited when it comes to color/pattern.  While I like this game, I found it's not as educational as some of the other Leap Frog games. It doesn't require any identification of numbers or letters, which I thought was a bit of a bummer.  But overall, it's still a fun game that develops fine motor skills, listening skills, and identification of doctor tools.
My twins recently got LeapPad2's and this is one of the first additional games that they have for it.  Both of them (boy/girl twins, age almost 3) enjoy watching the Doc McStuffins TV show, and while this has not been their favorite game, it does get a lot of play time. Like the show, Doc has to &#34;treat&#34; broken toys, and when she runs out of toys in the clinic to treat, she sends out a rescue helicopter to find more toys in distress to bring to the clinic. My children both enjoyed this game and did play it for about 15 minutes each before they got bored and wanted to do something else.  I think an older child would still enjoy this game, although common sense says that they would probably &#34;finish&#34; the game much faster than a 3-4 year old.
This is a nice little games that helps 3-5 year olds learn to follow directions and learn what types of things a doctor does. The younger child will find this game of interest for a longer period of time than an older child, just because there are only so many things you can do in this game. It's a nice introduction to the medical field.
Even if your little one is not familiar with Doc McStuffins and the cast of cute characters from the show, they'll still have fun playing this new LeapFrog game and getting to play 'doctor' while learning at the same time.Using Rescue Ronda (the helicoptor) you go out and pick up patients who need help and bring them back to Doc.  With your child playing as Doc they will examine the patient, make a diagnosis, and recommend a treatment to fix the problem.  The Big Book of Boo-Boos keeps track of all the cases you have successfully cured.  The more cases you cure the more badges and bonuses you get, such as new stamps and colors you can use to design your own bandages to use on your patients. Your child will need to use problem-solving skills to do check-ups and will learn health lessons as they go.The manufacturer's recommended age is 3-5 years and I think that is spot-on.  Some 3-year olds will likely need some adult help in certain areas.  My 5 & 1/2 year old had no trouble starting the game up by herself and playing, some parts were a little easy for her but she still had fun and has played the game almost every day. I think above age 6 would probably find the game way too easy and a little boring very quickly.
"This game is so much fun for my kids, they love playing as Doc to diagnose all their favorite Doc McStuffins patients. You get to ""use"" the medical tools from her doctor's kit to find what is wrong with the patient and then treat their ailment. They love seeing all the characters, I love watching them play it, the animation is pretty good and smooth for a LeapPad game. Five stars for teaching problem solving and logic."
I really thought my girls would love this because they are huge fans of the show. Unlike many other theme games they've selected, this one really didn't hold their interest for long. I sat and watched them play for a while to see what the game was about.Much like the show, &#34;Doc&#34; is doing assessments and making a diagnosis of her &#34;patients&#34;. It's just that there are only so many that she can make and the kids were through all of them in a couple of gaming sessions. So it soon became redundant.While the concept of the game is cute and fun, it just isn't quite worth the asking price because there wasn't enough content to keep them playing for very long.
I have a little guy (5 year old) that adores Doc McStuffins on the disney channel, so of course, he was very eager to play the game on his new leap pad ultra. There are plenty of games and activities ranging from designing your own band aid to playing the doc McStuffins theme song.  When playing, it teaches about the instruments doctors use, and in a few instances allows the child to actually stitch up some of the ouch's (by tracing a line with the stylus pen), There is a magnifying glass that the child needs to move in order to see the patients problem so Doc can then diagnose their symptoms. an excellent game for the 3-5 year old bracket.
My 3yo loves Minnie's Bowtique, so a few months ago we got her theeponymous LeapPad game.  Unfortunately that game was both a little difficult and a lot repetitive, and was quickly abandoned.  Doc McStuffins, on the other hand, has engaged my 3yo with significantly more intuitive gameplay and variety.What's cool is the game is built around two levels of learning: problem solving and discovery.  While my 3yo helps Doc diagnose her toys (and earn band aids), she is also learning about the importance of brushing her teeth, washing her hands, etc.  While she sometimes got stuck on the examination part, the overall game seems well-geared for the recommended 3-to-5yo crowd.
"Disney Doc McStuffins is an adorable cartoon that has been educating and entertaining children for a few years now and because of it's increasing popularity there is now a great educational game for your LeapPad or Leapster Explorer. The Disney Doc McStuffins Learning Game is recommended for ages 3-5 and older or more specifically grades pre k-Kindergarten.  The Disney Doc McStuffins Learning Game includes 4 different games which teach your child about Logic and Reason, Visual Puzzles , Making Observations & Health and Hygiene. My daughter loves the ""Doc McStuffins Check Up"" game and plays that one the most. This is a great game for any child who enjoys a challenge, and even if they haven't watched the tv show they will soon get into the game. 10 out of 10, way to go LeapFrog!update: This game will work on all Leappad systems (including Leappad Original, 2 and Ultra) and will also work on the Leappad Explorer system."
These games are fantastic for little ones. While they are educational, I would say that they are very forgiving and allow the kids not to get frustrated over them. Both my kids can play with this game and enjoy it despite a 3 year age difference, so it's also nice not to have to get a separate game set-up for each child.If your child likes Doc McStuffins then pick this up without hesitation!
First, let me commend LeapFrog for developing a Doc McStuffins game. I've been so encouraged by this strong, curious, smart character who is both female and black. As the mother of four girls, two of whom are black, I love what this models for them.Now let's get on to the game itself. My two six year old daughters LOVE it, even though it's geared toward ages 3-5, and one of my four year old sons loves it too. (Our other son, also four, isn't interested. I think he thinks it looks too girly.) All of the kids have seen the Disney show Doc McStuffins, so they were familiar with the problem solving aspect in fixing up the animals. They enjoy exploring the clinic, playing &#34;DOC!&#34; as they say in the doctor part, picking the right treatments, and figuring out puzzles/sequencing. They don't realize that they're also learning hygiene, which is a nice and sneaky aspect of the game that I like. :)
"We just received this game and my son wanted to play right away. I was a little worried he wouldn't like it because it's a ""girl's game"" in some sense.  He loves it.  We played yesterday and when I came home from work, he was already playing again. I can see that his hand-eye coordination with the stencil is improving, and the game makes it fun to practice those skills.  My son is four years old, and I think it's perfect for his age. It doesn't require any reading, but it is challenging - both hand-eye and mentally (you have to put things in order sequentially).  It has enough variety in the mini-games (picking up injured toys in the helicopter is a fast-paced game where you click to pick up stars and hearts as you race through the sky vs. the mini-games where you fix toys and stuffed animals, of which there are several variations we've seen to date). My son also enjoyed exploring the clinic and putting bandaids on boo-boo bear.I only have two complaints about the game.  The first is that it has a long load screen every time you play. It isn't obvious how to skip it (you click the screen).  So we've watched it a few times before I figured that out.  I guess it's not really a complaint - more of a heads-up to other parents!  The second complaint is that it did freeze up and we had to go back to home, re-enter the game, and re-do the activity.I really like this game as a parent because there's no violence. It's a very calm game.  Yet, my very active son who loves superheroes, robots, pirates and karate still enjoyed it and it engaged him for a longer period of time than most toys. It was at a good level that he could follow it and not get frustrated. Unlike other games for the Leappad, he doesn't ask me to help him - he can do it on his own."
I am very pleased that LeapFrog seems to be developing more LeapPad games for the 3 to 5 age group.  My daughter is 3 1/2 years old, and some of the games recommended for 4 year olds can be too challenging and frustrating for her.She likes the Doc McStuffins TV show, although it's not one of her very favorites.  She was super excited to get this new game for the LeapPad Ultra though, and immediately told me that she was going to be a doctor too.  I played this with her the first time, after which she felt confident enough to play it by herself.  I'm not a big fan of electronics for kids, but LeapFrog really makes great educational games.  I don't feel guilty letting my daughter spend 30 minutes with her LeapPad Ultra while I'm busy making dinner after getting home from work.
This is a super cute Leappad game.  As with all the Leappad games, it offers games that also have educational value.  I found this game to be particularly cute, with games where you need to sew up stuffed animals by running your finger or the stylus across the screen.  You can also just choose to play the Doc McStuffins theme song, which my two year old daughter likes to do over and over.  The only reason I have marked it down a star is because my four-year-old son does not like the game near as much as some of his others.  I believe it is because he doesn't like the Doc McStuffins show.  My daughter, however, does like the show, and although she is a little young for some aspects of this game, does enjoy playing it.  It may just be that the show (and game) are more geared toward girls.  Overall, I think this is a great game for girls or anybody who enjoys the show.
My daughter is five and a half years old and she's super into this game (and really likes Doc McStuffins). She enthusiastically plays with it every time she picks up her LeapPad lately so it's definitely a winner. It's pretty simple, however and I wonder for how much longer it's going to hold her attention. I feel that the age range given by LeapFrog (3-5 years) is just about perfect. It's a pretty simple game (find a toy, give it a checkup, come up with a diagnosis) but it's good for preschoolers. Most kids LOVE to play doctor so this is a nice extension of their own imaginary play. A great choice for a little Doc McStuffins fan.
"This is a very straightforward game that has a bit more of a storyline than some of LeapFrog's games. The sequence of what to do is simple to catch on to, as well.In the game, Rescue Ronda (a helicopter) flies to collect patients for Doc McStuffins to treat. Play here is a bit limited since only the stylus is used to click on things (stars, friendship hearts, and presents--which unlock things in the game). The helicopter flies itself. The stars are the rescued toys. Up to three toys can be rescued on each run.After that, the toy patient is clicked on for treatment. Hallie, Doc McStuffins, and a narrator direct what to do in the various steps. The player must click on an item as directed--such as a chart, magnifying glass, or stethoscope. This leads to little activities or games, like finding differences between two pictures, pouring liquids (by tilting the LeapPad), piecing back together broken toys, and sewing up rips.The game teaches little health lessons, like the importance of brushing teeth, washing up, treating scratches, and staying hydrated. The ""illnesses"" get added to The Big Book of Boo-Boos, with interesting illness names like the dusty musties.Once the patients are each treated, the sequence repeats.Some of the content is a bit repetitive. For example, animations are repeated, as are specific illnesses. But, overall, it's a sweet-natured game that really aims to teach while entertaining."
We love Doc McStuffins in our house, so exploring the Doc McStuffins LeapFrog game was really fun.  Bringing the fun of the cartoon show into the kids hands where they can help fix the toys themselves.This game is fun - it teaches kids about health and hygiene while helping them develop problem solving tools and helps them pay attention to details.It sounds funny, but introducing the kids to this game, they are a lot more conscience of washing their hands.  I still have to remind them, but it isn't an argument.  Cudos to Doc McStuffin!This game really does appeal to ages 3-5, and will be tolerated by 6-7.
