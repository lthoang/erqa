Top question:
How big is the actual window?  Looking at the print outs on Crayola.com, it looks like it is about half of an 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper.  Is that right?
Top review:
"I gave this to my niece and nephew as a gift a few years ago and my daughter thought this would be a fun one to have again.  See Thru Light Designer has two clear plastic windows to draw on and it comes with four markers.  Draw on one and then the other.  Lights light up either the front or back panel to make a scene.  Do it right, and it can be a moving scene.I'm disappointed with Crayola for going cheap.  Years ago, this toy came with some templates to show the kids the full potential of the toy.  It's impressive when they can see what it can do.  Now, we have to go to the Crayola site to download the template.  It's not even easy to find, and there's only one template!  Would it have killed them to throw in a few templates more?  Watching it work is what excites the kids.Luckily, my kids have seen this in action.  My daughter wants use this in combination with the LED strips and light-up toys in her room to make a  ""glow party.""  She gives it four stars."

Reviews:
The whole idea of being able to create a mini animation by flashing between two images is great, unfortunately, it doesn't really work on the Crayola See Thru Light Designer.Even in a completely dark room, you can always see both sides of the panels regardless of which one is lit up.  And if you draw an image that fills the whole panel or touches the bottom of a panel, it really shows up.  It just doesn't work as promised.What it does do it allow you to draw on a clear surface.  Oh and it has a built in holder for the markers.  Nothing worth $15 in my opinion.
My granddaughter has theCrayola Light Up Tracing Pad Pinkso I thought she would enjoy this particular product. Since she has been ill, we were looking for an activity that she could do, so I pulled this out to keep her entertained.She drew objects on both panels then we put them together and assembled them. The light itself worked best in the bathroom (dark), but she did enjoy the way it lit up the different sides and colors, flashed, and varied with how it showed. Then, after one picture, she moved on to something more definitive to play - like a color book where she could see the pictures.I'm not sure she got the concept of having objects outside of the light box be incorporated as a part of the art, but then after watching it, I'm not sure I got it really. Perhaps if her friend held it up and she drew a beard or something it might make sense. It might also work to place the clear plastic pieces over a picture and trace around them.But at age seven, those things didn't occur to her.
For myself and my two grandkids, this was a fun toy.  I help them draw (trace) from pictures of themselves and their mom and then animating the picture, the pictures they drew.  Honestly though, I do think I had more fun with it than they did.  Of course, the older one is only six and the younger only three.  I do believe they will ask to play with this again on the next visit, if only for a short while.If I have any problem with this, it is that Crayola neglected to mention on this Amazon Product Page that this device requires three AA batteries.  It was only after I had the product, did this come to my attention.I see my grandsons having hours of fun playing with this when they visit and their drawing skills improve a bit.  For now, Gammy is having fun playing with it.
With this Crayola See Thru Light Designer, we've found that the simpler the picture the neater the lighting effects are. So this actually works out in favor of kids who don't want to spend a long time drawing tons of details. The Light Designer is made so that kids color pictures on two clear plastic panels, and then when you turn on the lights, they switch back and forth lighting up each image. So when you have two similar and simpler pictures, it makes the pictures look like they're moving.The Light Designer comes with 4 mini gel FX markers which can be stored on the frame itself, so kids will know where they are all the time. Crayola does make other gel FX markers in more colors, however I'm not certain if they will work with this light designer. If they do, it would be worth getting them so kids can create much more colorful pictures.The light designer takes 3 double-A batteries which aren't included. To save battery life it does turn off on it's own when it's not been used after so long. A handy feature to have in any kids toy.Crayola See Thru Light Designer is a fun toy that can range in entertainment from one-time-use to plays-with-from-time-to-time. It's not going to provide hours and hours of entertainment, but kids can definitely have some fun with it, especially when there are a few of them making animated drawings together. The age range is 6 and up, but I can see kids a little older than 6 playing with this more frequently.
When I was little, magnetic doodlers and etch-a-sketch were the limit of drawing and erasing, so I am pleased to continually see new alternatives outside of the tablet realm for repeat doodling.This designer is actually quiet unique in that it presents two screens for doodling and uses lighting effects to add a different dimension to your child's artwork. On a surface level, the effect makes for fun play and is visually interesting for kids. On a deeper level, parents with a budding artist may find that truly unique works of art can be created with the multi-level possibilities of this doodler.I think anyone can enjoy it, but love that it can grow with a child.
This is pretty fun! My 2 and 5 year old likes anything that light up, AND they love to draw/color, so they've enjoyed this toy.First of all, you'll need 3 AA batteries. Those are not included. Thankfully, we keep a battery basket filled in our house, so we had some on hand. You'll probably have some disappointed children if there's no batteries around, though!There's 3 different buttons that give you various lighting for your &#34;light show&#34;. There's 3 screens to draw on, and two of those are removable. Just draw whatever you want on those screens, using the included markers, and put them back into place. Turn on the lights and you have a light show! There's also some online drawings at Crayola's website you can use to trace onto the screen if your artistic ability is like mine.This toy comes with 4 markers. There's a little storage space on the back(with 6 marker spots) so you can keep the markers with the toy.Overall, we've had fun with it! It's a perfect toy to pull out during a power outage!
I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect from this toy, so my expectations were pretty low, but it&#8217;s actually kind of neat. It&#8217;s basically a lighted dry erase board. You can download trace scenes from Crayola.com, but they are not anything really special. I think Crayola missed the mark here. There are two panels that you can draw on, so they should offer trace sheets that give a 3-D effect when you draw compatible scenes on the front and back surface.A nice idea for this is a message board. You can draw your personalized background on the back panel and then the front panel can be for messages or to-do lists.While the colors are nowhere as vibrant as what is reflected on the box, this is still a pretty neat little toy.
My niece really enjoyed playing with this. This drawing toy is easy to use.  I downloaded some templates for her to get her started. She used those templates at first and then started doing her own designs. She loved turning off the lights in the room and then turning on the lights in this toy and seeing her creation come to life. It kept her busy for a long time. She really liked making all sorts of silly faces.
By using this toy the way shown in the product video, my kids have been having fun.  This toy makes it possible to draw and then create a moving effect in the drawing.  I think this action teaches children some fundamentals of how cartoons are made.  My kids are extremely focused on cartoons and I believe they are making a connection.
"The Crayola See-Thru Light Designer is definitely a lot of fun and can spur a lot of creativity.  Children can ""animate"" their creations in several different ways.  There are two slide-out panels to use to trace pictures or draw on them.  Once you are done you simply slide them back in, turn off the lights, and begin the show.The nice thing about the Mini Gel markers is that they don't have a tendency to smudge when working with them.  You do have to make sure that the panels are clean and dry before working with them.  The panels wipe clean with a damp cloth when you're done.  Unfortunately, there's no way to save the artwork unless you snap a picture of it.There are a lot of unique designs on the Crayola site that can be traced or colored.  They can be downloaded and then printed out.  Many of them are designed with the Crayola Mini Light Designer or the Crayola Dome Light Designer in mind, but can be used with the Crayola See-Thru Light Designer as well.  The instructions say to look for tracing sheets on the site, but they are not listed as such.  Instead they were listed as coloring sheets.  I'm putting the link in my comments section so you won't have to search around.This is a fun, creative light designer that will provide hours of creative fun for children.  It's very well-made and I do like the fact that the markers can be stored right in the See-Thru Light Designer in slots on the back.  There are only four colors, orange, blue, green, and purple, but more can be purchased.  If you have a budding artist, the See-Thru Light Designer is a learning tool you just might want to consider.WHAT'S IN THE BOX:&#9658;  See-Thru Light Designer&#9658;  Two panels&#9658;  Four Mini Gel FX markersCRAYOLA Tracing/Coloring Sheets:These are for theCrayola Mini Light Designer, but can be used with the See-Thru Light or colored1.

This is a simple and fun toy for kids.  It's basically a holder for two thick sheets of plastic, that when slid into their holder can be drawn on, and also lit up.  Since there are two, the light modes offer a way to make a pseudo 3d effect when the lights blink back and forth.  The pens themselves write clearly and easily and are easy to wipe off the plastic.  It's very good for allowing a younger (or even older) child to trace, since you can draw images on the backside of one of the pieces of clear plastic, and the child can trace it on the other without ruining the original piece.  As the box shows, you can also make designs for your face or anything else you put behind it.There are a few 'see thru light designer' products from Crayola, this one like the others seem to work well, highly recommended as an easy and fun toy for kids (my 1 year old and 3 year love it).
"This is a cute little toy that you can draw faces on and then hold them up to other people or pets for funny effects.  The box says 6+ but this should not be mistaken for a toy a 6 year old can play with alone. Starting with a basic face we copied from the box, the children embellished it and their sister snuck up on people and shouted, ""Boo!"" while holding it up to her face all lit up.  Then their grandfather got into the act and figured out he could make special effects by drawing on the other side as well, adding new layers of funny, with the light blinking and showing the front and then back.We went to the Crayola site and finally found some pages to copy.  The drawings are pretty heavy handed so if you have a light or fast setting on your printer, you will prefer it.  In order to find the two part pictures, I had to google: crayola tracing shoot for see thru designer.  I still couldn't find all of them, just move around looking at the favorites.  I hope they improve the accessibility of these pages.  On the other hand, I did find lots of fun coloring pages for the children, so it kind of evened out.This Crayola toy requires more management from adults for the drawings and then to clear them off of and to keep small children from losing the markers or putting their butts up to the window.  It might have required less management if Crayola had flipped the back picture so it could be drawn on the back, using the tracing paper without removing the window, by slipping the page between them.The biggest flaw to this toy is the set up time.  The results are interesting but it requires patience to get to them."
If you are trying to decide between the Crayola See Thru Light Designer and the Crayola See Thru Dome- get this one. My kids love it.Because it is flat, it goes everywhere. My kids have done everything from animating over family pictures to making little cartoons they recorded on their Innotabs. The two panels slightly offset really do give a great animating effect. It was a fun chance to talk about (we homeschool) light and vision and how we see things. This has been used constantly since it arrived so buy rechargable batteries. I really wish there were a plug in option.
The Crayola See Thru Light Designer is a fun drawing toy that lights up in a variety of ways.  You can draw on two panes (front and back) and set the lights in a way that gives the finished drawings a kind of animated look.  It can give a child a way to think of how a drawing may change from one scene to another.  Otherwise, it is simple a fun see-through drawing pad.
My nephews really like this toy.They say is lots of fun!This toy however, does require three AA batteries. (we use rechargables in our household, that saves some $)
My 5-year old daughter loves to create, draw, paint, and do anything artistic. This toy was an obvious choice for her; she loves this Crayola Light Designer!  There are two see through panels that you can color on, allowing the child to create a two layered image. Both panels can be removed from the device, allowing for ease in designing and cleaning. Place the designer in front of a photograph, toy, stuffed animal or doll to add fun to the design. In addition, there are several different light combinations, lighting up the screen with flashing or still lights. Cleaning is easy with a damp cloth. The 4 colored pens store at the back of the device. A fun toy for any child that loves to create!
Overview: Transparent drawing board with lights.I like the light up designer board. It's fun if you like to draw. The end product looks really cool and you can draw in the dark. I like how you can change it so that you can have different light settings and your drawing can show up differently. It's pretty easy to erase, just wipe it with a wet tissue and it comes right off, but you have to make sure to wipe off all of the residue otherwise it'll show up the next time you draw on it. It's also kind of hard to see what you're drawing because the panel is clear.Summary: Something different from the young artist, a transparent board that can be lighted up.
This is a fun idea, and my 5 year old has spent a little time with it. She loves to draw and we can never keep enough paper around for her so I thought she would love this, but it really seems just so-so to her. I can see why. It's novel at first, but the novelty wears off very quickly. There are no templates or tracing sheets provided which is annoying. It would have been better with a little more to get you started. It seems kind of overpriced for being so basic, markers and a square of plastic. I expect it will be forgotten entirely very soon.
I'm a big supporter of Crayola products.  With a number of budding artists around me, they can never get enough drawing.  I started noticing the Light Designer toys about a year ago, but never had the opportunity to experiment with one until now.  We picked up two models: the Dome Light Designer and the See-Thru Light Designer.  As they really cater to the same interactive 3-D experience and have similar attributes, I thought I'd contrast them for those looking at the various Crayola options.See-Thru Light Designer (4 Stars):  Shaped like an Etch-a-Sketch, this board is clear and has both a front and back panel that can be drawn on independently.  The kit contains four colored gel markers (that easily clean off the designer), and you can make fully interactive experiences with lighting.  You can light the front panel, the back panel, or both to create a rudimentary sort of animation (it looks like the pictures are in motion).  As the board is compact and easily transported, the kids carried it around, stuck their faces behind it, looked through it at various objects and seemed to enjoy themselves overall.  Truthfully, really talented kids could probably do something quite neat with this.  It does go through the batteries, though, because it was always being lit one way or another.Dome Light Designer (3 Stars):  I thought this looked so much cooler than the See-Thru Light Designer, so I was surprised to see that it got a less enthusiastic reception.  It has the same four markers and a similar principle. You can draw on the plastic dome and there is a panel that is inside the dome that can be drawn on.  Using the various lights, you can make these interact.  You can also place items under the dome for extra play value.  Here's the rub, though, as a more stationary toy, this has less interactive appeal.  Unlike the See-Thru Light Designer, this one didn't get carried throughout the house for playtime.  Once the art was done, they just left it on the table.  KGHarris, 10/13.
I feel like this is the &#34;light brite&#34; for the 21st century (only, I still love the light bright).  This also, conveniently, had fewer small parts.  It just has that classic long-term-play quality.  If a light brite and a chalk board had a child, this would be it.  And it would be cool.The glow feature really glows, the markers are Crayola, so of course they are excellent quality.  It's small, low profile, would be an excellent take-along for car rides.Don't forget the batteries.
"The Crayola See-Thru Light Designer has two clear plastic sheets that can be sketched on with the bright gel markers and then the drawings can be illuminated in a dark room with special lighting effects.  It is part of the Crayola Light Designer series.A sheet of paper can be inserted between the plastic panels so that tracings can be made or to have two children each sketch on one side and then view the drawings together.  The Crayola website has thousands of coloring pages that can be used with the See-Thru Light Designer including a dozen ""tracing packs"" that have layered elements and a landscape orientation.The markers are washable.  Only four colors come with this set but apack of eight markersis available separately and I would recommend getting it.  Three AAA batteries are needed for the light but aren't included and I would recommend rechargeable ones, such as the Eneloop brand.This is an especially good toy to involve a slightly older child in helping a younger child in a cooperative play activity."
my kids love to draw. They love making funny faces and this is perfect for them. no paper needed just wipe and start again. I like that it lights up. it kind of gives it a three d. feeling . This is fun to do outdoors at nigh as well. The little ones get a kick out of this and enjoy trying to draw almost anything on it. Lot of fun great for driving in the car as well.
My 8 year old granddaughter loves this.She loves how she can layer the picture and see how it changes as she adds layers to it.It also is fun to trace items and then add things on top of it.Even for simple doodling it can be funnice for quite self soothing activities
It is a bit difficult to understand just what this product is, but Crayola has a nice video explaining it in the product images.  In the pack is the Light Designer, which has two clear removable plastic drawing boards, and four gel markers.  The latter give a neon look and wash off surprisingly easily with just warm water.  So, what do you do with this thing?Since the drawing boards are removable, they can be placed on a picture (or face) to trace it.  Want to draw something from scratch?  The clear boards still come in handy, since you can trace your own work and create a basic two-frame animation, similar to what you might do by flipping between two pieces of paper.  The Light Designer takes the work out of it by automatically lighting up alternating boards.  The effect is pretty good, though it works best in a very dark room.This toy is probably going to be used a lot for a little while, then forgotten, but the price is not bad for the entertainment it provides.  It might even spark some interest in art that will grow over time.
"My family sat together playing with this straight out of the box, well after we added the batteries (not included), we liked that you could draw on the front and back screens and use the buttons to go from one to the other or both. I enjoyed using the see-thru to my advantage to ""trace"" my kid's faces and make the images of them on the screens. I wish there were a few more colors with it, and the kids did get burned out on it before my husband and I did, but I think it appeals to everyone in some respect."
"I gave this to my niece and nephew as a gift a few years ago and my daughter thought this would be a fun one to have again.  See Thru Light Designer has two clear plastic windows to draw on and it comes with four markers.  Draw on one and then the other.  Lights light up either the front or back panel to make a scene.  Do it right, and it can be a moving scene.I'm disappointed with Crayola for going cheap.  Years ago, this toy came with some templates to show the kids the full potential of the toy.  It's impressive when they can see what it can do.  Now, we have to go to the Crayola site to download the template.  It's not even easy to find, and there's only one template!  Would it have killed them to throw in a few templates more?  Watching it work is what excites the kids.Luckily, my kids have seen this in action.  My daughter wants use this in combination with the LED strips and light-up toys in her room to make a  ""glow party.""  She gives it four stars."
This toy is made of two layers of clear plastic boards that overlap to simulate a 3D image. Comes with 4 neon color markers too enhance the light effects. What you do is just draw on it whatever design you want (time to play with your imagination) and view it while the lights are blinking around the edges of the board. It looks neat specially in the dark.You will need to provide 3 AA batteries which are not included.Cons:This is cool the first time you take it out of the box - or the next day. Afterwards the novelty fades fast. Another toy to toss for the next yard sale.
This is pretty cool if you have a child who loves to draw.  Effectively you have a unit with two transparent panels.  You draw directly on the panels with special included markers.  You can also slide something inside the panel if your child prefers to trace.  This could be a photo or you can go online to their website and download traceables.  It does not come with the batteries, so if buying for Christmas, you'll want to get those as well.After drawing, you push buttons on the bottom for light effects - basically moving lights that light up all or parts of the panel.  When you turn off the lights in your child's room, the colors of the markers glow nicely.  The back of the unit has spaces to hold the markers when you're done.Cleanup is easy.  You just use a damp towel or paper towel to clean and the panel is ready for more drawing.My daughter is a drawing fanatic, so loves this.  She also gets a kick out of drawing something and then putting it up to my face so that the drawing looks like it's part of my face.  I love the fact that there's little to clean up when she's done with her art work.  However, keep in mind, if your child doesn't spend a lot of time drawing already, they may tire of this quickly.Very pleased with this!
My 9 year old absolutely loves drawing, so I assumed that she would spend hours playing with this designer. That just didn't happen. I'm not sure if it's because there are only so many colors, or because she didn't feel inspired, but it wasn't her cup of tea.That being said, I had a lot of fun with it! I loved goofing around, drawing all sorts of things and then lighting it up. I do think getting a lot of patterns would be the best idea, but much like Silly Putty, the Crayola See Thru Light Designer is definitely the type of toy that requires your imagination and inspiration for total enjoyment.
I have other Crayola light designer items and this one is not my favorite - but it's still fun!  The gel markers catch the light pretty well, especially if you turn the lights off.  So, with this, you have two frames, and if you draw an offset picture for each of the frames, you can get a neat little animation as the light alternates between the frames, making them show up sequentially.That's fun, but it loses its charm pretty quickly.  Neat - you made an animation.  But it feels like it's not enough.Personally, I like the Crayola Dome light designer a lot more.  It's a bit more expensive, but the great thing about it is that it stands alone and you can have it out as a desk light, a night light, a fun centerpiece ... whatever.  And you can still do all the fun animation stuff that you can do with this product.So overall, I recommend this because it's fun, but I would urge you to consider the dome light designer too!
I love the Crayola brand products and have rarely bought a crayola product that I have not liked beginning when I was a kid using the big crayola box crayons. The see through light design was a hit-the kids played with it for hours laughing.If you have a kid that is music to your ears!  LOL
So... You draw on this item, and then you can hold it up in front of something - a face, a toy, a photo, a screen of some other sort, and it's like you DREW on IT.That's ok, I guess, but we just draw on our windows much more easily.Suzanne GoseHomeSchooling Mother of FiveAuthor of Flip Flop Spanish Series
My grandkids and I played with this and enjoyed it. It's easy to use, and the flat design is easier to draw on than the similar dome shaped designer offered by Crayola. The kids liked being able to trace items easily be slipping printouts between the pieces of plastic. It was also easy to draw freehand, allowing them to be as creative as they wanted. The colors do not glow the way the picture on the box displays, as they are rather bland and flat. I took away a star for that. Otherwise, we all enjoyed it. The lights offer a variable switch that lets them blink or rotate as desired. This made it fun for the kids. It automatically turns off after a while, so you can save battery power. The kids used it like a night light that they made themselves. It's not the best toy, and there is room for improvement. However, it was fun and they are still interested in it after having it a few weeks. Hopefully they will continue to enjoy it for a while.
"I love the idea of this product.  My 12-year-old daughter and I have been enjoying drawing stuff on it.  The lighting effects are pretty neat although it doesn't totally do the objective of making your design look like ""creativity in motion"".  The problem is that although the lights flicker back and fourth between the front and back drawing it still doesn't totally eliminate the picture that's in ""the dark"".  You can always see both pictures even though one may be dimmed.  It's still pretty neat though.My real problem with this product is that it doesn't come with any helpful design ideas.  I think something, like a drawing idea book, would be helpful in getting kids imagination started and give them ideas.  You are instructed to go to Crayola's website to print out ""tracing sheets"" if interested.  If they even do exist, I can't find them on their website.  You would think you could simply type ""tracing sheets"" into their search box and find them but you can't. I came across some other tracing sheets but I don't think this is what they are meant for.  Even if they do exist, I prefer not to waste a bunch of ink printing out these sheets.  It would be nice if this product came with some tracing sheets rather than having to print them out.  Even if only a few, something would be nice to at least get the kids started.Overall, my daughter and I like this product and we can come up with some ideas of our own but it would just be nice to have a little inspiration of some sort.  I would recommend this product but I think it would best suit children aged 8+ who have a wider, creative imagination."
I have 2 little girls that are into all manner of art projects.  I thought they would really love this item as it is at least a little different than anything else they have done.  They did love it for about an hour and then mostly lost interest in it.  I must admit I'm a bit surprised, but there you have it.  I suspect this will get thrown out within the next year to make space for more cherished items.By my observations, the main problem is the fact that the lights don't really do anything unless you are in a very dark environment.  This leaves you with 2 sheets of clear plastic that you draw on and a little frame to hold them (which, let's face it, adds very little value).  I suggest you just go to the hardware store and get a sheet of plexiglass for a couple dollars and use that--it will probably be just as cool (disclaimer--I haven't tried that, but it seems like a good idea).
Note:  You do need to have AA batteries on hand for this to work - it does NOT come with batteries.We've had a lot of fun with this - both designing funny faces and seeing what each person in the family looks like with it, and also making drawings and designs and putting them in the bedroom window (no need for the lights then).This is pretty sturdy, and we have not had any problems with the drawing surfaces (we had tried out a similar drawing toys, and the drawing surfaces wouldn't stay in, so I'm thrilled with this one!)The gel pens are fun and have neat effects.
I'm usually a big fan of crayola products but I think they might have dropped the ball on this one for the price. If you have a very creative child, maybe they might find it fun. Check out the video to the left of the product image to see what it does. In this age of ipads, xbox and fast-paced instant gratification I don't think this will hold a child's attention long. Well, on the positive side it's REAL quiet.Note: I would like to add the batteries are a real pain to install but the cover has a screw so nosy little fingers can't get it off. Erasable markers (instead of the gel) work a little better and rub off easier. The instructions say the toy will go into sleep mode after 15 minutes. I think mine has insomnia.
