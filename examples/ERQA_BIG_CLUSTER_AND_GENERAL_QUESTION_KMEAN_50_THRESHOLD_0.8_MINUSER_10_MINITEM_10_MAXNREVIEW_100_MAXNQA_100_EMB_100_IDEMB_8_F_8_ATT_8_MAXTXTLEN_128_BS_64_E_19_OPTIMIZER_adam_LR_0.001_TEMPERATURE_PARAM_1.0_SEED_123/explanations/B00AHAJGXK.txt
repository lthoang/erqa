We're big sidewalk chalk fans and we love Crayola too so we were excited to get the 48 count of Crayola sidewalk chalk.When I was little I loved getting a box of Crayola crayons and I loved looking at all the beautiful colors. The thing that always set Crayola apart from other brands besides the top quality was that they had all their colors named right on the crayons. I contribute me knowing all my colors including every shade of each color to Crayola.When we got the box of the sidewalk chalk, the top of the box has a picture of the chalk with all the names of the chalk shades. I was in Crayola heaven. Soon I was disappointed. I opened the box - the chalk is not in the same order as listed on the front and the chalk itself does not have the color names on it. The picture of the colors on the box is much more vivid than the chalk colors are in actuality so you can't really tell which color the chalk is suppose to be. That's a small thing but that's kinda the whole point of Crayola, I want to know if I'm using Golden Rod yellow or Dandelion yellow.We also had a couple pieces of the chalk arrive broken although Amazon's packaging was great. That's probably just part of getting chalk, I'm sure if you bought them in store, there may be some broken.On the brighter side: the chalk. The colors are nice and the 48-ct box goes beyond just the typical red, blue, green and yellow chalk that you normally get. The colors are bold, bright and beautiful and look great on the sidewalk when you use them. They spark imaginations.The chalk is also squared to prevent rolling while using on the sidewalk.The box is a nice cardboard box with a handle so it's nice to carry outside with you and storage for the chalk when not in use.Overall, besides the initial disappointment with the color names, we really like the chalk. So much more than just the average colors that can pick up at the dollar store.

I had been looking to buy sidewalk chalk for my granddaughter to use when she is visiting and I saw this box of chalk.  There are so many wonderful colors that I just had to get it.  The colors are really vibrant and they translate to the sidewalk in the same color.  My granddaughter loves to make pictures with the chalk and loves to play with her aunt and grandpa with the chalk.  The chalk doesn't seem to break easily as my 19 month old granddaughter is quite rough with them.
This box of 48 Crayola colored chalk pieces has 48 unique colors, in every shade imaginable from red to black to gray. I was happy to find that there were no repeating colors.Instead of the usual round, crayon-like chalk pieces Crayola makes, these chalk pieces are squared off, which makes them easier to grip for younger hands.This box makes a thoughtful donation to your school's playground or a birthday party gift for a preschool or kindergarten child.This is a summer essential for creating chalk towns in our driveway, hopscotch, and bike racing paths!

There are many pluses to this box of sidewalk chalk. First is the sheer array of colors - 48 different colors in one box, ranging from bright pinks, greens and blues to paler and softer browns and yellows. Second is the fact that the chalk sticks come with points, unlike the usual blunt tipped sidewalk chalk (although the tips do wear down rather quickly anyway). Third, the thick chalk sticks are square, so you don't need to worry about them rolling away and getting broken (although they will break if dropped). And finally, the box folds to create its own handly carrying case (although the tab is a bit hard to get out without ripping it).My daughters and I spent about two hours outside on a gorgeous Saturday morning and we managed to fill most of our front steps and the front sidewalk. We've worn the tips off of most of the chalk and used up the bright green entirely, but we still have plenty of chalk fun to go. Then, sadly, it rained Saturday night, leaving only a faint pink residue where the brightest pink had been to remember our ephemeral creation.Recommended for the outdoor artist in your family.
I love the gorgeous shades of the chalk.  I love that they're square so they don't roll.  When I looked at the chalk before opening each shrink-wrapped group of 4 pieces, I was expecting a 5-star review.  Unfortunately, by the time I'd unwrapped all the chalk, I discovered that 4 pieces had arrived already broken in half.  Not only should this not arrive with that many defective pieces, but it makes me doubt the overall durability of the chalk.A lesser complaint is that the cardboard box was very difficult to open, near impossible without ripping the tuck-in tab.  This box is not going to hold up to use by children.  However, I still would have given the chalk 5 stars if it had all arrived in one piece.
Chalks are easier to review. Few simple things differentiate between the dollar store and good ones. Color contrast, washability, consistency are the main parameters. Most of the cheaper ones look different, but when drawn will all blend. This one stands out nicely and oranges, reds, blues and greens are bright and distinct. They are easy to wash and don't stain cloths or hands. That is the first sight that they use good dies and not cheapo petro chemical dies.  In terms of consistency again top notch. They are smooth and without lumps or sands. They draw on all surfaces smooth or ruff with ease. Worth every penny as it makes a lot of fun. If the chalk is not consistent, it is not useful for drawing intricate details. Pay a little more than dollar store and you can truly appreciate the results.
I shouldn't criticize chalk for being delicate. I shouldn't. That said, 8 of the 48 colors were broken upon receipt. The chalk was packed super tight into the box and was difficult to remove or put back in.Beyond these annoyances, all parts of the chalk (broken or not) were usable and it was fun having such a range of colors. I'm not sure that my 3yo appreciates all the color options as much as I do, but it was the first time we were able to make a proper rainbow on the sidewalk. The typical chalk packs are very pastel in brightness.The chalk itself was less grainy and brittle than many other cheaper chalks I've used. The color saturation was better as well as the workability on a smoother cement surface.Overall, considering the price point is currently $8 for the box, it seems well worth the cost if you're looking for a more diverse sidewalk chalk palette that is made a of slightly better (less airy) quality than the chalk you're most often likely to come across.
This is the best side walk chalk I have seen.  The colors are really bold and great!  My kids are really enjoying using this side walk chalk.  They are also not round but like in the shape of a triangle, so you can use it on its side better.  I did find that the chalk maybe a little softer then the cheaper chalk, so it appears to get used faster, but it is worth the variety of bright colors.
This is a really great set of chalk.  They did a good job of picking out a ton of colors and the colors are really vibrant.  The sticks of chalk themselves are big (~3/4in, bigger than a marker)and they are square with rounded corners so they are comfortable to hold and don't roll away when you set them down.  I do think they are softer than the smaller sticks of chalks so they don't make really fine lines, but the other side of that is you get alot of good color which is much more important to my kids.  It's also not really fragile, my kids did manage to break several pieces but overall I think for kids chalk it's fairly robust stuff.  All in all I couldn't be more pleased with the set!
Beyond bubbles and inflatable bouncy balls, sidewalk chalk is surely a sign of summer's arrival. My kids, for 8 years now, have crowded my blacktop driveway with their artistic creations.We have had every brand of chalk it seems, from Crayola to Dollar Tree and Target. They all pretty much work the same, but there is something about the Crayola brand that whispers 'childhood'.First off, this is a great, BIG box of chalk. There are 48 different colors, all shades of blue, red, yellow and so on. The chalks are about 4-5 inches long and best of all, they aren't completely round. The squared edges stop any rolling while on the sidewalk or driveway. This is very helpful with small children who work in smaller areas. The chalks are shaped like a crayon, with a finer point at one end to make thinner lines or turned on its edge and color big swaths of space.The box is sturdy and doubles as a carrying case. There is a nice, strong handle. This would make a great gift for Elementary School or Preschool teachers!
The first thing you notice about this box of chalk is that it's heavy. Kids like that. They feel like they're getting a lot---and they are. The next thing you notice is the enormous variety of colors. Kids can make whatever they can imagine, without being limited by color restrictions. The pieces are thick and they write/draw well on pavement. We also loved the names of the colors. Why just use purple when you can use Purple Mountain Majesty? Need a different shade? How about Mauvelous?For less than $10, this is a big box of old-fashioned fun, whether the artists are in preschool or 5th grade. And better yet---no batteries required!
My grandkids almost 4 and 2 have so much fun drawing with this chalk. They are attracted to the bright colors. It is fun to see their designs when approaching their house. I will be a repeat buyer of this product.
We always buy Crayola chalk. I love the vast array of colors now available. I also like that the colors are listed on top of the box. The case has a pop up cardboard handle which would've been useful if my daughter hadn't broken it almost instantly. =D The only problem I have w this item is that many of the pieces were broke when I opened the box. The pieces were placed in the box w no protection and many broke leaving chalk dust to coat the entire inside of the Amazon box it came in. Funny, since I just bought the 52 count sized chalk from here and did not have that same problem. With that chalk the pieces were shrink wrapped into rows of 5 or 6. This must be what kept them from breaking since they all arrived intact. I got this from Vine but if I had paid for it I would've sent it back since it was at least 1/4 of the box that was affected.
My daughter and I love this sidewalk chalk and it's by far the best we've tried. You get 48 vibrant colors that really make the kid's artwork pop and at about $10 is a great value. The chalk writes smoothly but the points do wear down pretty fast. The large size of the chalk is great for toddler hands as well and I love the square design because it keeps them from rolling all over the place and getting lost!I also love that the box has a nice carrying handle so that it makes transporting it very convenient. It is a cardboard handle so it can easily break though. The chalk colors are labeled on the inside of the box, but once the kids start taking them out they'll never be in the correct spots again haha.We've used this chalk for many hours and still have most of the colors left so they last a long time and are a perfect creative option for outdoor fun. Never buying another brand of sidewalk chalk again - this one is the best!
This sidewalk chalk is wonderful, and unlike some of Crayola's other sidewalk chalks these are NOT individually wrapped which is wonderful. Who wants to spend the time to individually unwrap 48 shrink-wrapped pieces of sidewalk chalk? I sure as heck don't.All 48 pieces arrived in one piece with no breakage whatsoever. The cardboard box serves as a nice storage case and all of the colors are shown and listed on the top of the box. I'll spare you the list of all 48 colors but lets just say every color in the rainbow and every color in between is available in this assortment of sidewalk chalks.They color and write nicely and are wonderfully vibrant. Definitely the brand I'll purchase when looking for sidewalk chalk or a great summer birthday gift for a child.
"I immediately liked the square shape of this sidewalk chalk.  I felt it was more comfortable to grip and of course, it's nice that it won't roll away.  The colors are lovely and and bright.  We only had two of the 48 sticks of chalk arrive broken, which didn't bother me much, but I would have been bothered if I had more arrive broken like other reviewers have experienced.They are advertized as being washable, but the box states:""FOR BEST RESULTS: Crayola Sidewalk Chalk is designed for use on concrete or asphalt  sidewalks and driveways.  To remove, wash surface with water pressure from garden hose.  Light brushing with a broom or nylon brush may be necessary.  STAIN ADVISEMENT: Product contains colorants which may stain clothing and other surfaces.  Before use, test on a small inconspicuous area and wash off to make sure product does not stain.  DO NOT USE ON SURFACES LESS THAN 6 MONTHS OLD.That said, we haven't had any problems with staining so far.  My toddler got it all over the sleeve of my jacket and it washed off just fine.  It was a windbreaker type of fabric, so I wouldn't have expected it to stain anyway.  I would be more worried about cotton t-shirts.Overall, these are fun for keeping the kids busy during the summer."
