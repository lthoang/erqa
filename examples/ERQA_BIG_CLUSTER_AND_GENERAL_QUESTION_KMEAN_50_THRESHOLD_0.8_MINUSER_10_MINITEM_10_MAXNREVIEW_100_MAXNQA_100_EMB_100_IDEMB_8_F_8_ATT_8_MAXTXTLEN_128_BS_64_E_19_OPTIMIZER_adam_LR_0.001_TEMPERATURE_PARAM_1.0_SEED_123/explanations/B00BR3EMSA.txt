I really like this rattle. It is great for babies who are just starting to get their hand eye coordination and it will also keep the attention of older babies as well. It is light enough for younger babies to hold and maneuver when they are just getting their coordination together. The rubber coated rings are soft and bendy. I am sure older infants will love to chew on it while teething. The rattle makes a soft noise like small beads inside - nothing loud, obnoxious or startling and I like that about it. It is not the typical louder clacking noise. The rings on the sides are perfectly sized for baby hands of all ages. They seem secure too. I tried to actually pull them off of the owl and couldn't. It is a simple toy, but will keep them entertained for a decent amount of time before moving on to something else.

My daughter hasn't been too excited about this toy. She rattles it around and has done a little chewing on the loops but it is very soft in the noise department when rattled(a positive thing in most cases but I think it doesn't make enough noise for her). She has looked out the simple owl face and found interest in that but otherwise, she moves on to other toys pretty quickly.We haven't tried this one in the car to see if it is a good car entertainment item but in the house, it gets overlooked with faced with other toy options.
So many rattles or teethers are clunky, noisy or too heavy for tiny hands. Not this one! The Manhattan Toy Zoo Winkels Owl Rattle is made for little hands with plenty of surface for babies to grab on to, and while there is a little bit of noise, it is not very loud at all, adults will not hear it in a public place, just loud enough for baby!
My 4 month old likes this toy.  It is very easy to grasp and hold.  The colors are bright and he enjoys looking at it.  One afternoon we took it in the car and I could hear him playing with it because of the rattling noise.  The rattle sound is very subtle.  He does try to put it in his mouth, but unless you insert it at a certain angle, it's kind of hard to chew on.  It's more of a suck kind of toy for him.  That is why I deducted 1 star; not really for teething. It is different than any rattle I have seen in the stores.  I would definitely recommend and purchase again or buy as a gift.
Discovered something extra wonderful about this owl rattle that was meant for a new baby in our family.An older family member who had suffered a stroke and was doing physical therapy and was learning to grasp items with their right hand, lit up when they saw this rattle.It was easier for the stroke victim to pick up, and the design and size made doing some visual exercises easier and more successful.Yes, the baby boy loves the bright colours and gentle rattle sound and in a few months he will be able to pick it up himself.  No rough edges. Soft and the covering is durable and easy to wipe clean.  It's well made, bright and the rattle part isn't obnoxiously loud.
Our 7 month old prefers this to her Grab Apple.  It seems very well constructed and she has been chewing on it since we got it.  The owl is cute and the bright colors make it very appealing. Since she is teething she really like it when we put it in the refrigerator overnight.  It doesn't stay cold for a terribly long time but she seems to really like it better when it is cold.
What a colorful, well made, adorable rattle. I had a hard time putting it down!Its a solid rattle that is easy for little hands to grasp and its soft enough that when they always hit themselves it wont hurt them.
This is a cute but pricey rattle. The &#8220;wings&#8221; are a soft and flexible plastic that works well for chewing. The owl body rattles lowly when shaken. The rattle is a good size. I&#8217;m glad the wings are soft, because my daughter likes to bang this on any surface she can find. Of course, she like to bang just about everything these days. This is cute, but I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s worth the price. It is just a rattle, after all.
This is a good baby toy in that it has a few different things going on to keep baby interested. The interior bird is a rattle and the colorful loops are a bit flexible, so they can bend a bit and be a fun place to bite and grab. Overall I like it and baby likes it too!
many excellent features of this teether are lauded after pilot testing, including the several loops making it easier for the infant to grab and to grasp, and the thin width of the loops easier to chew.grandmother very excited tooto curb your enthusiasm is not in the pictureand the little bird?NOT angry
I've got four kids.  I've seen a lot of baby toys.  Frankly, most of them are trying to hard, or are designed to get parents to buy them, not to actually get babies to play with them.  This is a nice, simple toy that a small baby can grip easily.  It makes a little bit of noise, but not enough to annoy Mom and Dad.  It's also reasonably priced and it travels well.  You'll want something like this in your baby toy arsenal.  Actually two like this, in case you lose one, or it's in the car, or you just can't find it.  They are that handy.You also want two of those crinkly Lamaze toys (for the same reason you want two of these rattles).  Don't buy a ton of baby toys for a small baby, because THE BABY DOESN'T CARE.  You are the best baby toy, and you are free, so save your money for college.
My 6 month old grandson enjoys this toy.  It serves as a teething ring, rattle, and toy combined.  Seems durable.  Holds his interest for long periods.
We love our original winkel and this owl rattle is a perfect addition to their line.  It really rattles and makes more noise than the original.  I haven't tried popping it in the freezer but will definitely try that next time we are teething.  I will say that if you have the original, you don't really need this one, they are basically the same with the exception of a louder rattling noise.
My 5 month old nephew is fascinated with this and there are so many places to hold onto.  As most parents know, they go for glasses, hair, jewelry, etc, so any toy that can keep their hands off of my stuff is a plus.  Lots of bright colors and handles and they are secure on the hard center rattle.  It's not advertised as a teething toy but everything goes into the mouth anyway.
YES! This is even more adorable in real life. Amazon offered me a chance to get this product in exchange for a review. I was so excited! I have several friends with new babies and soon-to-be babies...so this is a great little baby gift.It would be adorable tied on to the handle of the gift bag with a fancier gift inside or as a gift-alone for those on a lighter budget. It's not something you see at all the local chain stores.Zoo Winkels Owl Rattle is all simplicity--no bells or lights or whistles. Just old fashioned teething and gripping with  delicate little rattle noise. And an adorable owl face and vivid colors to make it fun. It's completely sturdy. The loops are of a durable yet flexible plastic so they are nice for teethers.The version I received was totally frustration-free packaging (NO packaging). Just a tag. Manufactured by Manhattan Toy based out of Minneapolis or their London, England branch. It meets or exceeds CPSIA safety regulations.Is it weird that I'd like to stick it on my dresser for decoration?If this review was helpful to you, please click YES below. It gives me warm fuzzies and helps my rank. Thank YOU, in advance.
Great for grasping, shaking and gnawing! Manhattan Toy has made some fantastic toys and this is one - colors are bright and it is safe enough for baby!
The owl is colorful, soft, has a nice soft raddle to it and is so pretty. At almost 3 months our baby can hold it and seems to be interested in more than just getting it to her mouth. It is easy to clean and seems to hold up well to the use of baby and her big sister checking it out. I would say this is a baby toy they will use.
"This is a very nicely designed toy for an infant just discovering hands and how to control things and, of course, chewing! It's lightweight but sturdy and easy to clean in hot, soapy water. The colors are pretty and the bird face has the big eyes that attract infants with face recognition. It's flexible enough to not be ""hard,"" but the ""wing-rings"" are large and far apart and strong enough to permit baby to grasp and hold. They also stick out at many angles so the baby can grasp easily and manipulate it as s/he get older and more skilled. The rattle is not loud or obnoxious - just a soft sibilant sound.I'd happily give this versatile toy to an infant."
My 8 month old grandson loves this toy!  He can easily grasp the loops with his hand(s) and bring it to his mouth for chewing.  The plastic is soft but tough enough for him to scratch his gums.  The colors are bright and the plastic tubes are very secure to the owl rattle.  The owl has a cute little face that looks at the baby while being chewed on and has a quiet rattle that only the baby can hear.  Very soft and soothing!The rattle is small and compact and easy to tuck into a diaper bag or stroller.  Lots of enjoyment for a little one!!
This is just the cutest thing! I've got a new granddaughter, plus a 1yo & a 2.5yo granddaughters, and the 2 older ones love this! I actually got it for the newborn, for when she is a bit older of course, but I'm letting the others play with it until she is old enough. The owl in the center rattles and the loops are a soft rubbery plastic. Perfect for a teething baby/toddler.
Although my infant granddaughter is not quite old enough to grab toys yet, we adults had fun squishing and manipulating this cute owl toy on Christmas afternoon when it presented itself as part of her Christmas stocking! The loopy &#34;wings&#34; of the owl have just the right degree of squishiness, yet tension, to make handling it a rather addictive activity - I can see a baby becoming very enthralled with its movement, ins and outs, and texture of the loops on teething gums. The rattle also has a wonderful, subtle rattle that actually has a pretty sound. I will be shopping for more toys from this high-quality line!
I am giving this as a gift to a friend's new baby.  I think it's just adorable!  It's bigger than many rattles, but it's very easy for a baby to grasp.  The colors are vibrant and fun and it makes a nice, not-too-loud rattle sound.  It's an owl, which isn't immediately apparent, but it's cute.  I won't know how durable it is till the baby starts playing with it, but it seems well-made to me.
Baby tested, mother approved! This toy is cute and colorful, easy to grab, and is really well made. My favorite thing about this toy personally is the rattle. I typically despise noisy toys and was pleased when I discovered the rattle in this one sounds more like rice in one of those plastic Easter eggs than a true rattle... it's not an overly obnoxious sound and I don't cringe every time my child reaches for it (which happens to be quite often because it's a favorite around here)!I have zero complaints about this toy. Great product, highly recommended!
"The plastic loops are sturdy and durable ~ yet supple & very flexible.The baby of the family is teething and so far biting hard on the loops don't show any teeth marks.The sound of the rattle seems softer to me then many others.The springy loop design of the rattle is nice so it won't bang furniture if / when baby throws it.This brightly colored, cheery rattle is perfect for a babies tiny hands.There's 5 plastic loops ~ 1/4"" diameter ~ on each side of the 1 3/4"" diameter center 'owl face' ball,which allows for baby to easily & comfortably hang on to the rattle in various ways.Total size is 6 3/4"" long, 3 1/2"" tall, 2 1/4"" wide.I had forgotten I put the rattle in the freezer, so it was there 5 hours.When the rattle is removed from the freezer, it's nicely chilled, but not to cold for a baby to immediately have.The plastic retains a nice amount of coolness for a soothing teether for about 5-10 minutes.No information is stated concerning the plastic material.The only information given is ~""This product meets or exceeds EN71 and CPSIA safety regulations"" (Made in China)"
I really like the quality of Manhattan Toys and this is no exception. My baby is too young for it yet, but it's brightly colored and has lots of places for little hands to grip, not to mention the adorable owl.
This multi-handled rattle has myriad things going for it:  lots of color, minimal weight, gnawable endurance, and a pleasant beady sound.  The owl's body is a ping-pong sized ball with a beebee rolling sound that gives a lot of soft buzz for a baby's jerky effort. The ball is placed deeply within the rings, so no chewing can reach the ball and eliminates the dim chance of it coming apart, and would not be a choking hazard, anyway.  The loops lend themselves to attaching to a strap, so it won't end up lost on the floor or in the mall.  It is non-gendered, if that is a concern.
This is a great toy for a baby.  I don't think the rattle is annoying and it is full of color to keep ones attention.  I am pleased with this rattle and I think it will also be a great teething toy! Jesus' Blessings and Peace
I think this is a perfect to for baby. So many things to grab and hang onto. It rattles and is colorful. Easy to wash. I think this is a great item for baby. I would put it in the freezer if my little one was teething.
This toy is both functional and visually appealing!  It is great for a variety of reasons.  First of all, it is colorful and attractive to even the youngest of babies.  The many rubber loops are great for grasping and when the baby shakes it, it becomes a rattle.  Put it in the fridge and the rubber loops become a teether.  You can't go wrong with this cute little owl.  My daughter loves it and will continue to play with it for months to come.  This is a great product!
I really like this rattle. It is great for babies who are just starting to get their hand eye coordination and it will also keep the attention of older babies as well.

This is great.  I got it for my new nephew to use.  One problem is that the toy comes with a tag that says age 0+ - I would never give a child without motor coordination a hard plastic toy to play with.  I would recommend this for a slightly older baby who is not likely to bop him or herself in the head.  My nephew loves the bright colors and it really engages him.  I love that this can be placed in the fridge for teething, with all the loops, it will make a great little teether.
I thought this would be bigger and it would be in a box but it was shipped in a plastic bag. The toy itself is strong and durable. Makes a nice rattling sound.Would recommend for a first toy!
The Manhattan Toy Zoo Winkels Owl Rattle is a colorful toy, with a quiet (not overpowering), rattle in the owl. It's great for little fingers to grab with no pointy ends. It's a nice chew toy for babies. Strong and well-made, I would recommend.
I got this for my 6 month old grandson. This is easy to hold, has plenty of loops for teething, and makes a rattle sound when shaken. It's lightweight and compact, which makes it ideal for the stroller or a travel bag.Unlike some other teethers, which are made out of hard plastic, this one is made out of pliable rubber. I don't think my grandson has a preference, but just something to be aware of.
This is my first experience with a toy from Manhattan Toy company and I'm impressed! This little rattle is very cute and well made. It's very easy to grasp and is lightweight. The rattle doesn't make a loud noise, so it won't startle the baby. The handles are flexible and a little soft, and it feels like it will be perfect for her to chew on when she starts teething. The colors are bright and the face design is cheerful. We really love this rattle!
