do the cars float when they are out of the boat?
Top review:
We adore the Green Toys line! A few years ago, we added the Garbage Truck into our home, and it has remained one of the most played with toys! Last year we added the airplane, and this year we've got to add the tractor, this boat, and a rocket.These are wonderful, DURABLE toys, and money well spent when it comes to toys. My children LOVE playing with them. They use their imagination and the only noise made is from them. They require no batteries, and my brain doesn't feel like it's going to explode from hearing loud &#34;toy noise&#34;.Another great feature is the fact that they are made from recycled material!As far as what we've experienced from the Green Toys line so far, these are wonderful, CLASSIC toys! Highly recommended!!!!

Reviews:
I really wanted to love this boat more, but it kept filling with water and sinking in our tub.  My son enjoyed playing with it, but it was often submerged in the water like a submarine.  I would dump the water out and a few seconds later it was the Titanic again.  I guess it was okay while in the tub, but if it was in a swimming pool it would be on the bottom.  Not exactly what you want in a float toy.The positives are it's eco friendly - which I LOVE!!!  More products should follow in their example.  I love the packaging, and that the boat and cars are made from recycled products - and only the good stuff.  Just wish it didn't sink so easily:-(The boat and the cars are nice looking (the cars wheels can come off, so not for little ones who will choke on them).  The ramp pulls out and goes back in easily, works well.  It's a soft ramp, so it's bendy.  The construction of the boat and cars are top notch, with fine detail and workmanship (no sharp edges).We will keep for play in our water/sand toy outside where it has less opportunity to sink.
GREEN TOYS Ferry Boat with Mini Cars is yet another toy that has all the wonderful features that this company uses. Made from recycled plastic milk jugs in the USA, the GREEN TOYS Ferry Boat has no harmful coverings or dangerous BPA, and the colors are safe as they are made from soy ink. We have the seaplane, car hauler, and submarine by GREEN TOYS and my 3 year old grandson loves them all. He plays with the submarine and seaplane in the bath and they help develop his imagination and vocabulary. He didn't know what a Ferry Boat was until he saw this and now has a storybook with one in it that he can relate to. He loves that the slide out ramp is used to load the cars and he also uses the one that came with the car hauler to load his ferry. The cars go on the bottom level and he could actually put more in but sometimes his rubber ducks go in there! The upper deck has benches and windows and he likes to try and put a toy fire man he has on that deck. Needless to say, it could keep him entertained in the tub for hours if I let him. A wonderful, engaging toy that parents can be comfortable with knowing their child is safe playing with it.
We adore the Green Toys line! A few years ago, we added the Garbage Truck into our home, and it has remained one of the most played with toys! Last year we added the airplane, and this year we've got to add the tractor, this boat, and a rocket.These are wonderful, DURABLE toys, and money well spent when it comes to toys.

Highly recommended!!!!
I got this for my 4 year old to play with in the bath.  One of my concerns is that the plastic toys we usually buy are full of harmful chemicals. I like the Green Toys because we don't have to worry about them slowly breaking down and leaking out those chemicals.My four old likes it so much he wants to take a bath constantly!  A combination of a boat WITH cars, two of his favorite things, is just perfect.  I've never let him take his other toy cars in the bath because they aren't made to be wet, so this was like a special treat.I would definitely buy this as a gift, or more items of this brand for my children.We also have an airplane that is for the water, made by the same company and my son has played with it in the bath for quite some time with no wear and tear showing at all.  Definitely a quality product!
In the past I have criticized Green Toys for making toys that don&#8217;t do enough to inspire imaginative play.  The toys didn&#8217;t come with figurines, space to place figurines, or enough other interactive elements.  With some of their newest offerings they have taken a real step forward.Pros1. The ferry is the same environmentally friendly, thick plastic made in the US style of toy that I have come to expect from Green Toys.  From a production standpoint they put forward a very superior product.2. The toy floats well which is good for a bath toy.3. Interactive parts like a sliding ramp, and the two cars help inspire imaginative play.4. You can separate the bottom of the ferry from the top which facilitates easy drying.Cons1. The ramp that pulls out for loading cars is flimsier then I expect from Green Toys.2. When you separate the top from the bottom the  ramp always falls out.  This is the first toy from this company I have ever owned that has a build flaw.Wishes:1. Would have been great to see a pilot house or a wheel on the ferry2. I wish Green Toys would make a single sized figurine that was integrated across their product line and compatible with all new toys.  This would make for a more interactive environment between the various green toys.  In addition it would help contribute to brand image.Conclusion:Overall a fairly solid effort, the problem with the ramp is the only real reason I did not give it five stars (my son keeps taking the top off and then he can&#8217;t get the ramp back in himself).
I love the Green Toys. For one reason they come out of the box easily. Not ties or tape to worry about. I have a 14 month old and a five year old. Within seconds of the ferry and cars being out of the box they wanted it. I was so glad it came with two cars as they could then have one each and share the ferry. This is a great simple toy that provides hours of play.
My son loves cars, but I don't usually let him take them into the tub for fear that they will get ruined. Enter this product which is meant for the bath, and now, we have no more fights at bath time!
Sometimes the best toys are the simplest ones, and this one is pretty simple. Designed to be a bath toy, the ferry with an extendable ramp and the two cars offer a lot of options for imaginative play.Seems to stay clean and be totally waterproof and should last a very long time. The boat can be opened up by pressing in the tabs around the middle if you want to wash it inside and out at some point. Would probably be dishwasher-safe, but it did not come with any instructions or documentation so that's just a guess.Pretty much indestructible so far.G.
"Sure, this is perfect for the tub. Also the toddler's swimming pool. Also perfect in my grandson's sand/water table. The boat glides through the water side, and at the edge, he pulls out the movable ramp and offloads cars into the sandy beach (the other half of the table.) What's not to like? Colors are brilliant and child luring. It has no hazardous parts to worry about the child harming himself. The durability seems to suggest endless enjoyment. My grandson's not-yet-arrived-sibling will be playing with this toy when it gets as old as he is now. With two cars for the boat, they can learn to share together. (It could happen!)Lightweight, yet very durable. NO METAL PARTS to rust after getting wet, and a boat is meant to get soaked. Washable via bucket, hose, or dishwasher. By the way, even with my grandson's less than gentle play, this boat is seaworthy, and remains afloat, upright, doing its duty. The duty is active, non-tech-screen creative play, a development ingredient every child needs. This toy will be around for the next generation, or I've missed my guess.USA made means helping our country's economy.All thumbs up positive for this ""Green Toys"" item, and after more than one toy ordered, I would recommend any toy from this company. I've not mentioned the total recycled materials used; that's just the icing on the boat, so to speak.Also check out theGreen Toys Tractor Vehicle, Orange."
I like the feel of this Ferry boat, sturdy, yet light weight.  Lots of imaginative playtime with the use of it being both a water/bath boat toy and then, when docked and the ramp is pulled out for the two cars to explore new terrain on land.  These cars are the perfect size for small hands to drive/maneuver.  And a huge bonus that this is made of 100% recycled materials!
This is my 3-year-old's second Green Toys vehicle, and he adores it. Like theGreen Toys Tractor Vehicle, Orange, its size is substantial enough for him to play with it on his own, but not so big that he can't use it with other toys. The boat and cars are all sturdily made, and I don't feel like I have to worry at all that they might break or come apart.The boat actually does float in water. It's got a curve on the bottom that allows it to float on the surface of the water without taking on water. That being said, it is hollow, so it will sink if a child chooses to hold it under water or flood the top (my son likes to hold it under the spigot). While it's hollow, it's not sealed, which is actually a very good thing because it allows you to completely drain it of water and allow it to air dry.The deck of the boat has convenient grooves that allow the two cars to be placed side by side in the center of the boat or front to back. They don't exactly snap into place, but they fit well enough that they won't fall out during normal play. The two car, one boat combo is perfect for in and out of the bath.
I have several things from Green Toys for my grandchildren to play with and have been very pleased with all of them.  The ferry boat has been well received, too.  They are not as brightly colored as toys by other manufacturers, but I don't find that effects their fun.  I love the fact that they are made 100% from recycled milk jugs.  Even the packaging is recycled paper printed with soy ink.  It feels good to find toys my grandchildren like playing with and, at the same time, taking care of the planet a bit.  Oh yes, there is a Made In USA label.
I have received at least three Green Toys for my grandsons through the Vine Program. This is the favorite. I have three grandsons who love to take there bath in my garden tub and this boat is what they fight over. It floats, as do the cars that come with it. I just need to purchase two more so they will each have one. A great toy at a good price.
I love these Green Toys offerings. This is my third one. We have the bus, tractor, and now the boat. This was the coveted one over the other two. The boys has a cool ramp that comes out and goes back in. The two cars can drive up into the ferry. It's fun.The coloring is a bit plain, though. The tractor is vibrant orange, but it's is plain blue. Minor criticism.
I originally ordered the green toy ferry boat because it is a green toy. I like all of my bath products to be organic or green. So this really excited me. My son is 3 and takes long baths so I didn't want him to be sitting in water with toxins. He loves playing with the boat and cars. this is his favorite bath toy now.
My son loves boats and cars, so this was a natural fit for him. This is well-made, actually floats and provided a great deal of bath-time fun. It's also fine for use outside of water play and seems very well-made and sturdy. I also love the use of recycled materials, not only as an environmental plus, but also as an introductory point for a conversation with your child about why we should recycle and who/what benefits from doing so. Though this is listed as designed for ages 3+, I'd feel completely comfortable, personally, giving at least the boat part--the cars could lose wheels, which might be choking hazards--to a child as young as 1.
This is a pretty great ferry boat set, our son is crazy about it and plays with it in the bathtub every night. We really like that it is made out of safe plastics -- we're so tired of worrying about BPA and all that stuff. This is made from recycled milk jugs, so it's all pretty decent plastic.This ferry boat has another big advantage compared to our son's previous favorite bathtub toys, which were mostly rubber squeezable animal and car figures. The problem with those was that it is very hard to get all the water out of every one. And if water stays in, those toys grew mold pretty fast. Then suddenly one day, you squeeze the toy and a bunch of disgusting black stuff comes out into the bath water. Really yucky. But no problem here -- bathwater does get into the body of the boat pretty easily, but it also comes out easily. Plus, the whole boat can be disassembled for cleaning, which is also a great advantage in keeping mold out.Since water goes in so easily, there is one drawback -- the boat sinks pretty easily! So it kind of turns into a submarine spontaneously. But that's OK, really. You just pick it up, pour out the water, and set it on the surface of the bathwater again.This is best for a toddler, and maybe for a somewhat bigger boy too. It is well made and it has a nice ramp that the cars (included) can use to &#34;board&#34; the ferry. The cars are also simple but great. We wish more toys today were as simple and good as this.
Very cute toy and my grandson loves the cars, perfect size to be hand held and carried around the house. The cars so far have been little boy tough, meaning dropped and tossed and still holding up.  The ferry boat construction is of very thin plastic, and the ramp for the cars is not easily pulled in and out.  It tends to get stuck as the ramp is a bit to narrow for the slot.While I love the idea of green toys, I would just prefer the construction to be a bit more sturdy and better done for the ferry boat.
This is the fifth Green Toy I have picked up for our son (currently 2 years). They are made in the USA from recycled milk jugs so no BPA (or other toxic) contamination to worry about. They are also dishwasher safe which makes cleaning them easy.The boat floats, even when full of water (as do the cars). Our son loves the ramp that can be tucked in or pulled out and set onto various objects to make a bridge for the cars. This, the Sea PlaneGreen Toys Seaplane, Yellowand the TugboatGreen Toys Tugboatare his favorite pool toys.The engineering, build and materials on these Green Toys is superior to anything I have seen out of China. It is not flimsy cheap plastic. These toys are solid and can really take a lot of abuse.We're fans.Thanks for reading. I hope this review was helpful!
This toy hasn't reached the bath yet (I don't even now why it is advertised as abath toy, to be honest), and is played with by a child much younger than the suggested age. So far my 11-months old vrooms the cars around, slides on them on the floor and tries to put them into the ferry and slide the cars down the ferry slide.I would say, the toy is a good investment and will entertain children of variety of ages.Sustainability is always a plus.
