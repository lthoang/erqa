*****UPDATED***** Will stick with my original rating of this toy. Nothing special, another large piece of plastic in the corner of the room that does not get played with.*****FIRST REVIEW BELOWWould have liked to post pictures of this toy, especially the vehicle that is included but my camera battery is fried.Before ordering I watched the product video on Amazon, looked at the posted images and scanned the product info, somehow completely missing that no Transformer vehicles are included with the fire station - not one. Can be bought separately for $12.99/each--bringing the cost of this toy to get it operating as advertised close to $100. The included vehicle is a fire truck with an attached ladder that minimally moves and a crappy pict of a transformer painted on the bottom--pretty close to a dollar store version of an authentic transformer.The fire station itself so far is ok. Just ok. Twisting the front dial to get it talking and lit up does not hold my guys' interest for long. I like that it folds/closes and is transportable. Plan on taking it to my older kids practices where there are tons of younger siblings playing together to see how it plays among a larger group - after ordering more vehicles of course.So far it's a 'Meh' toy, another large piece of plastic piled in the corner of the room that doesn't get played with. I'll see if that changes once the transformer vehicles arrive. For the money and play in my house ordering the vehicles alone without the fire station is a better option.

My six year old daughter (total tomboy) was excited to get this toy originally, but since she does not play with it much.  Here are her criticisms:1. The toy is uneven, one side is taller than the other.2. Not enough sounds or lights (there is only one button that makes the tower do anything and it only says two things)3. The pieces don't stay in position: the action figures don't stay in place, the doors don't shut.4. Accuracy issues, she has a problem with the multiple useless wheels and features which don't belong in/on a fire station anyway.5. There could be more activities and features to her want to play with it for a long time.6. Difficult to close7. The picture shows a cop car and a bumble bee figure not included in the set.(She also chose the ratings)
I got this as a gift for my girlfriend's nephew.  He loves firemen, firetrucks, firehouses, etc.  In fact, he had his recent birthday at a local firehouse that offers a up close look at all of the equipment and trucks.  He loved it and his friends thought it was the coolest.  So of course, he wanted a rescue heroes fireman related item.  At first I wasn't sure if this was quite the right pick, but after seeing his face - this was the perfect gift.  There are electronic sounds for the sirens and little plastic flames for the trucks to pretend putting out.  This item, for the money, offers a ton of extras that many others in this price range do not.  He isn't really into transformers, but after playing with this - you would've never guessed that.  All and all, I couldn't have found a better gift.
If you have as much fun as I do buying toys for little boys, then be sure to grab this one!  What an adorable firehouse!  The building looks just like your everyday firehouse, hoses, firetrucks, etc., but wait.  There's an invasion coming on the voila!  The doors turn into a transformer and the firetrucks are on their way into battle!  There's a firehose to slide down, the thing talks to you the whole time, and all-in-all, the thing just sings of hours of playtime.  The boys just cannot get enough of this set and even the older boys have some fun with it!  Since it's entirely of plastic (with the only exception being the voicebox), it is a very easy cleanup.  My only complaint is that it is a bit flimsy at times so if you can get it for less than $50, then by all means, avail yourself of the opportunity.  Other than that, YOU JUST HAVE TO BUY THIS TOY!  Highly, highly recommend!
"Optimus Prime + Fire station.  I mean come,on.  My kids when wild when the saw this.  Honestly I didn't even know where they learned about Optimus Prime but they recognized him right off the bad.  The build of this toy is good.  Not great. But good enough.  The fire house/transformer thing seems a little hokey to me, but my kids are really into this toy.  Now, they only vaguely know that Transformers are some kind of super-hero but that's good enough.  They end up mixing it up with a bunch of other toys and making up games that may, or may not involve fire fighting or battling bad guys.  If the little girl from next comes over it might end being a doll house for a while.  At the end of the day it's a clever little toy that kids can use for all sorts of imaginary play and the ""transforming"" bit just makes it a little more fun.  Once you make the batteries disappear, it a parent friendly toy too.  I between my kids, the neighborhood kids and a gaggle of cousins I've seen a lot of kids check this out, and it seems to stick pretty well with the 4-8 set."

"At first glance I loved this toy! The packaging was easy to open and it looks very impressive in the box. Unfortunately there are no transformer rescue bots in the box. I realize the description does not mention them, but I guess I figured there would be at least one transformable toy. I love that it is sturdy and colorful. The red knob creates noise, sirens and lights. It is portable and easily transportable. I definitely think the age range is closer to 2-4. My 2 year old neighbor absolutely loved it. He found other toys to drive in and out of it. He was enthralled by the sounds and lights and it kept him busy for a long time. Definitely keeping it as a toy to pull out for the little ones when they come over. But I do not think it will entertain an older child, even the 4 year old neighbor didn't find it entertaining enough. He was upset, because nothing truly transformed and the mechanisms didn't make anything ""zoom"" out or ""spray"" out. So if you are looking for something portable to use and already have other transformers, then this would be a good addition for a younger child. But if you do not have the transformers, then you will need to purchase some in order for everyone to be truly happy."
My boys were thrilled to see this package being unwrapped.  They haven't watched any Transformer shows, but they are still somehow aware of what they are.  The idea that this was a Transformer fire station made this so much more interesting to them.  They loved the fact that it made noises and had lights.  It comes with a fire truck that looks like a Transformer underneath and one fireman.  This toy kept their attention all night.  We will see the long term fun value in the coming days.  I only have two problems with this toy.  First, the truck launcher does not really launch the truck, more like a nudge.  You can barely see any movement when you try to hook it up.  My other problem with this toy is a basic one, price.  For how much you are paying for this toy, I think it should do some more things or come with more accessories.  Overall, it seems to be a good toy, perfect for boys 2-4(in my opinion).The price on Amazon has dropped since posting this review from $49 to $34 for this product...much better and worth the price.
My four year old liked it but was not the right product for a seven year old. The batteries were pre-installed which was nice.The kids liked the buttons and the actuators although it only came with one figure.The best part is that it closes up and has a built in handle for portability. But note that this is not small.
What a great, fun, loud boys' and tomboys' toy! There is so much that this toy does that it's impossible to describe it all in a few words. From the minute kids see the toy in the box (!) they fall in love. Then, when we (finally) get everything out & they start playing, there are hours of glee that follow with the cars, bots, etc., etc. One word: this thing is loud! Kids love to make it talk and make noise, and there are many options for this, so even if the kids are quiet for hours, the toy is not. Not for quiet, contemplative children. But for pure raucous fun, this is the one.
"I received this play set free to review it for the Amazon Vine program. As such--a free toy, unexpected, between birthdays and holidays--it's great. My kids have had a lot of fun with it, and were thrilled to unwrap it. They're lucky I got it for free, though, because there is NO WAY I would pay anything close to $50 for this thing. The product photo on this page makes it look like a lot more than what it is, somehow. When you actually get the box, it's not much. A building, ONE car/robot (which ""transforms"" rather lamely when you flip it over to front or back) and one little action figure guy. That's it. To have fun with more than one kid playing with it, you'll need to go buy additional transformers at $14 each. Honestly for all the fun my kids have had with this thing, half the time they have it out they are bickering over who gets the car and who gets the little dude. The building is very basic and cheesy and makes some really annoying groaning/siren type noises. The car is flimsy--nothing like the transformers I remember from the 80s--and not very well-made. I suspect it will all get broken in a squabble sooner rather than later."
"Hasbro's Rescue Bots line sets imaginations ablaze with the Rescue Optimus Prime Fire Station.  The station is an excellent kid-sized toy that ""transforms"" into Optimus Prime's head with the turn of a knob, or opens up to become a playset for the included Cody Burns action figure and Heatwave Transformer.It is compatible with all of the other toys in the Rescue Bots line, which is a plus since the toys vary in size and difficulty to transform.  The included Heatwave Autobot is one of the simplest Transformers in the line.  Simply turn the toy up on its rear bumper to reveal the ""transformed"" Autobot beneath.  The Cody Burns figure can sit in the Heatwave figure as well.The set comes with a firing water cannon and targets that flip up on the set.  There's also a really cool fire pole that Cody Burns can slide down.  The set also comes with other standard playset features such as lights, sounds, opening doors, and a lift.My son really liked the Heatwave Autobot and the Cody Burns figure.  In fact, he played with them more than the actual playset.  He liked the water cannon, but tired of it after only a short amount of time.  He also enjoyed the fact that he could ""transform"" the station into Optimus, but wanted to know how Optimus was going to move without legs!He has a couple of other Rescue Bots toys and used them with the set but, as I've already stated, he ended up using them with the Heatwave and Cody Burns figures more than with the actual set.Overall, a decent ""base"" of operations for the Autobots, but maybe lacking in longevity."
"I got this toy through Amazon Vine for my 18 month old daughter.  She's into cars right now, so I thought this might be fun.  We have some of our own cars, so the fact that it doesn't come with any cars wasn't a big deal, but $50 does seem like a high price for only including a little action figure and a ""fire hose/gun"".  I wasn't overly impressed with the product.  It doesn't really do anything special (out of the ordinary).  She seems to really like it(so does our kitten), and has played with it a number of times since we got it a week ago, even though it's kind of placed out of the way.  There are some buttons in the back, meant to be computers, that talk when you push them, and she spends most of her time pushing those.  It's nice that it comes with batteries (one less step!), but I wouldn't pay full price for this toy."
"This is a keeper. Not only does my grandson love this toy, but it's durable too. From Optimus Prime to a fire station, he hovered around me, hands clapping, until I undid all the wires keeping it in the box.Made of sturdy plastic, and colorful to boot, I made dinner while emergency  vehicles swirled around my feet. From, ""C'mon gramma. Play with me!"" to ""Do I have to eat dinner now?"" This toy served its purpose in keeping little ones entertained.My grandson reluctantly bid Optimus Prime a fond farewell when his mom and dad came to pick him up, until I promised I would buy him one for his very own.A quick smile and hand-wave made my day as he scurried out the door. This toy does everything I expected of it and it's worth the money to see a smile like that on my grandson's face."
"Please LOOK at the PICTURES at the BOTTOM in the PRODUCT DESCRIPTION.  Do NOT go by the PICTURES by the TITLE (at the top of the page) as those include different, as well as extra things (that you will NOT receive).  This is one of those toys that is big and looks impressive when you first glance at it in the box.  However, after opening, that initial ""wow"" wears off quickly.  It is one of those toys that is played with when you first get it, but is then quickly forgotten."
"I agree with some other reviewers here, it's going to be just one big of plastic in the house. I am putting this review note in to support all those 1, 2 and 3 star reviews. The toy lacks vision as to what it's targeting. For a 70 dollar toy, there is no replay value here, too much role playing needed to make it any fun.The build quality, plastic, is all good, but really for something to be from transformers line, it has to be more futuristic and more ""automatic"".And one more thing, never ever get it for a daughter or girls by any chance. It is absolutely boring to girls :)"
My little one is a fan of the transformers but he is not yet able to transform the real things. This rescue car transforms easily and he enjoys it.We also have two other fold up type of toys - one doll house and one spiderman fold-up structure. He plays with both frequently and I can see this one as a welcome addition.If it really sells for $50, I don't think I will buy it. $20-30 seems reasonable.
I was delighted to be able to get this for a young boy who is a huge fan of the Transformers in general and Optimus Prime in particular. The toy has provided hours and hours of playing time, which has, of course, involved bringing all of his transformer toys out to play as well. Interestingly, of all the features of the set - and there are many - the one that has been the biggest hit with him has been the book that accompanies it.This will be a definite hit to any child who loves the Transformers. I will issue a warning: this is a loud toy. You can always remove the batteries and produce a quieter toy, but if you don't mind your kid getting a little loud - or to be more precise, don't mind their toys getting loud - this could be a perfect and hugely popular gift for all Transformers fans ten and younger.
My 5 year old son was very excited to get this for Christmas.  He played with it for about a day and then it went on the shelf and hasn't been taken down again.  It looks like it would be fun, but it doesn't come with everything pictured.It's like a Transformer themed Imaginext set, but the Imaginext sets are much more popular in our house than the Transfomer sets have been, despite the fact that my boys do like Transfomers.  If I had it to do over, I'd invest in another regular Imaginext set.
