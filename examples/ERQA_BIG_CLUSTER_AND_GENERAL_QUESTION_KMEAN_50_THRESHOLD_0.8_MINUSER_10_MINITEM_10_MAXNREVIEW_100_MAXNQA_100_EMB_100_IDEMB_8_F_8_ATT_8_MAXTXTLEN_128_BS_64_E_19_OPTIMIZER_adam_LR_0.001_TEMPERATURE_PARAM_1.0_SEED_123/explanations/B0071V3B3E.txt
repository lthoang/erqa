Top review:
I have mixed feelings about the Singing Machine.On the plus side, it comes in an interesting shape and it's painted in several potentially attractive colors (we got the teal). More meaningfully, the owners have the opportunity to download DRM-free songs, with our without voice and, at least for the half a dozen free songs that came with the player, there was no need to provide credit card information. Still as a positive, the microphone - and the player supports 2 mics - has a cool design and all controls other than the on/off switch are on the microphone. The player supports either downloaded files off a USB drive or CDs.All good so far but here are some of the less impressive features:- TOO MANY WIRES: to get the player to work you need to plug it into a power outlet, plug in the necessarily long microphone and then run another wire (included) from the player into your TV. The whole thing looks... spidery and the wires easily tangle. A better player would come with a battery option, a wireless microphone and, why not, support for Bluetooth.- TERRIBLE DISPLAY: the font that displays the menu and the lyrics are huge and ugly almost to the point of being an eyesore. In addition, when 'viewing' the files on the TV screen the player is unable to see any metadata. It would be not nice but expected to see the song name and the original artist name rather than 'file names', especially since the huge fonts makes it impossible to ever see the complete file name on the screen - they constantly scroll left and right.- DIFFICULT MIC CONTROLS: they are embedded into the mic's body but they are hard to see/feel and they are not always responsive.- VOICE IS NOT LOUD ENOUGH: there may be something wrong with our mic but the singer's voice is barely audible, even when we turned the background music volume to the lowest possible and the voice to the highest.Overall, this is a somewhat usable Karaoke player, maybe for a child but even our little girl used it once, said it was 'OK' but, as far as I know, never came back again to use it even with all the wires left attached to make it easy for her. The ugly screen fonts, the abundance of wires and it supporting only bulky USB drives but not much smaller SD cards are significant demerits. Add the somewhat high price to the above and expect many buyers not to be happy post purchase.

This microphone is great as a Karaoke machine, but it needs some improvements. First, you can only control the volume through the onscreen menu and the controls on the microphone. So, if you want to use it without a display you need to go with what is set, unless you hook it to the TV.Also, I wish it was battery operated instead of just cord operated. That would allow for easy transport, allow the cords are very long and give a lot of movement room. The CD tray is easy enough to open and it does have a lot of options. The blue color is very bright.
My wife likes karaoke and I thought this bright pink machine would be great to have in the house and for parties.  I wasn't expecting much and it was okay.  Easy to set up and good to play CDs, but I've seen and used better.
"I got this as a 2nd machine to use as back up and for my daughter to take over to a friend's house. We already have plenty of music cds etc., so purchasing more or getting free music was not something I was looking for. I like this machine, because it is simple. It is small and easy to take with you wherever you are going. You never have to worry about the remote getting lost as it's attached. And it's pretty darn hard for even the smallest of children to break it, as it seems very sturdy and it's lack of buttons means it's easy to operate. The USB option is wonderful as I prefer using this over dealing with scratched cds. I do wish it had options for having a second or wireless microphone. I also wish the design was a little more square, as it seems like they tried to design it with a ""cool"" look, but I was looking solely for space saving and the odd size isn't as easy to work with. I would purchase again to use as a travel player and my kids love it."
Before even considering this karaoke machine, make sure it is understood that this is not a fancy machine, it has absolutely no bells and whistles and is not remotely high tech (pun intended), its major selling point would be that it is difficult to lose the remote...  Which is what is the best thing about this machine, it's simplicity.I have used many karaoke machines, and my machines tend to have a lot of the bells and whistles like built in video cameras, record back functions, vocal effects, video effects, etc, etc, so in many ways, these machines were a down grade for me.  Ironically, it was a downgrade I've enjoyed, the simplicity of it is actually refreshing, and its so moron proof a child could easily use it, which would not be the case with my more high tech machines.The machine is tiny!  It is smaller in diameter than my head is, I measured both, my head is 24inches, and the karaoke machine is 21inches.  It's smallness is quite impressive,  it is very light as well which makes it extremely transportable, and is one of the biggest reasons I chose to get this machine as I travel a lot and visit friends and like to take my karaoke with me.  :)Another selling point of this machine is that it supports a USB hard drive, if you have an extensive disc collection, it is a lot more convenient to put it on a flash drive and use it that way, which is what I am in the process of doing, it gets old lugging around heavy CD cases when I can carry a tiny USB flash drive or a hard drive instead and carry 100x's as many songs.  This for me was a huge thing as I borrowed my friends machine which had this function and my old fancy one did not, and I had no problem taking my old one to salvation army for the mere fact that this one could play more songs more easily, even though the old one had more functions.This is a very durable machine, I took this to my best friends house, she has two children, one 2 one 5, and they did not harm this machine, they even yanked it on to the floor by accident (about a 5ft drop onto laminate flooring) try to grab something off of the shelf it was one, I put it straight back on the shelf and and turned it on, worked just the same.  I honestly don't think my older/other machines could handle that kind of abuse.The remote is actually extremely handy, especially around children, since it is difficult to lose a plugged in remote.  I did not have to worry about my friends children losing it, it was refreshing!  Even, though it echos just a smidge when you press a button (inevitable being the buttons are close to the mic), it is not a big deal, though putting the buttons a little lower down may have been a better idea, at the same time, they sit where you would normally hold the mic so the design makes sense in that regard.  Since there are only 6 buttons on the remote, it is extremely easy to navigate, thought it is obnoxious that when using my flash drive unlike some other machines I have used, when pressing the stop button, it takes you straight back to the main screen instead of back to the folder you picked the song on, which is annoying when you have several folders, but that is a fairly minor quibble, not a huge deal.The mic portion of the remote, if not adjusted properly, seems downright quiet, however, if you make sure your volume on your TV, the music volume, and the mic volume are all adjusted properly, it is pretty loud.  If you are having a problem with the volume on it, make sure these three things are properly balanced, as being that the speaker on the karaoke machine isn't huge (since it is a small machine), it relies more on your TV to augment the volume of the mic output, so having the three of them properly balanced is vital, and not difficult to do.  In terms of the sound, adjusting the echo will be necessary as well as the echo is set very high as a default, so make sure to adjust that in the menu as well.The machine itself, as already stated, is very durable, and while with the sliding CD compartment, it seems like it would break easily, especially with children, I have found that is definitely not the case.  The CD compartment itself swings open, only in one direction though, and doesn't just slide easily, so it isn't like it is going to just randomly swing open on its own.  While at first, it seemed like this design would be a flaw, it again, adds to its simplicity and ease of use, no buttons on the machine except the on/off button on the back, which against is very nice when having a party, makes things simple.This simplicity of this machine is so backwards in a way when karaoke machines for the layman have so many extra functions besides being for karaoke, whereas this one may seem like it is a step backwards, but really its not.  I really do enjoy that I don't have to pick anything else up when I want to change a song, or bend over, just simply move my thumb.  Love how light this machine is how easy it is to use!  II is an ideal machine for small children  because of its minimal button design, small size, and durability. It is also ideal for karaoke parties because it makes everything easy to do, and is not at all confusing to use, and it makes it easy for users at a party to adjust the sound themselves without hassle. :)If it is a simple no frills machine you want, you cannot go wrong with this one, I have had no real issues with it whatsoever after using (both of) mine for 2 weeks straight, no issues at all.  On the other hand, if you are looking for a machine with more functionality, but is still portable and easy to use, I highly recommendKaraoke USA Karaoke System with 7-Inch TFT Color Screen and Record Function (GF829), I have a review up for that machine as well.  It really all depends on what your needs are. :DGod Bless ~AmyPS:  A not on the free songs, mistyped my email when I registered my product so I couldn't get the code, and The Singing Machine company has yet to respond to my emails, I and that is the sole reason this machine gets marked down from a 5star to a 4star product, very poor customer service.
My 10 year old and her friends use this all the time.  Set up is so easy, that she literally ran off with the box and never needed me for set up at all.  Within 5 minutes, I could hear music blasting upstairs, so no issues there.  The microphone works great, and it is multifunctional as she tends to use it as a regular CD player, since she can easily take it outside when she needs outdoor music.  I wish it had a small screen on it, so the cables and tv wouldn't be necessary, but that would obviously increase the price.  Very happy with it!
This karaoke machine is pretty compact and looks nice out of the box. The player for cds is very sensitive, when i first tried to use it none of the disks i tried worked. It was however very easy to hook up to the tv. The micro phone also doubles as a remote so that's cool. It would have been nicer had the Mic been wireless, but the cord is pretty long.I tried it again with the included disk ( nursery rhyme type songs) and it worked although there seems to be a very harsh echo at times.You can also get free songs and purchase songs on the manufactures website. There is also the option of buying karaoke cds and you can get those right here on Amazon!You can also hook up ipods and things like that for variety. Regular cds can also be used but unless it's a CD+G disk it won't show the words.Overall its a fun machine and a great way to build your child's confidence with singing.
The Singing Machine was easy to set up and use. This is fun to use for the whole family. This actually is helping my young child read/sing more fluently!!I personally don't understand why karaoke machines cost so much. For nearly $70 this machine should include more free songs.I like the small portable size and smooth mircophone handle. The ability to play songs as a CD player is a nice additional feature. I would have given it 5 stars if it included more free songs and a wireless microphone connection where mulitple singers could all be connected.
I was expecting a nice, simple, easy-to use Karaoke Player that even my 11-year-old daughter would be able to use but unfortunately this machine is not what we were hoping for.Looks- The Black is a nice option for our living room so it blends right in with our other electronics on the TV stand.  It has a nice shape and look to it.  Unfortunately this is the only category that I would rate it well in.Set Up- The instruction booklet is easy to follow which made set-up fast and easy.  The cords (for both the power and the A/V) were too short in my opinion.  I think they should've been at least double the length.  It would be nice to be able to move the machine to the middle of the room so you can hear yourself a little bit better.  We were stuck leaving this machine on the TV stand.Music Options- It's easy enough to put a CD in.  Unless you have really young kids, the included CD is a joke.  It's like Kidz Bop Nursery Songs or something.  You'd be better to use your own CD's or a CD+G.  Your other option is to use a USB Drive which is what we did.  It's easy to operate but a bit of a pain to get their songs as explained below.Registration, Free Songs & Downloading them- Along with the player you get an insert instructing you on how to register.  The first thing it tells you to do is go to their website and click on Customer Service & then click Online Registration.  Not true.  Clicking on the Customer Service at the very bottom of the screen takes you nowhere.  All you need to do is click on Register Your Product under the Support section at the bottom of the main page.  After registering they'll send you a code to download 5 free songs from their website.  Make sure you pick the Video Version rather than the Audio Version or you won't have the lyrics.  We picked 5 songs and checked out easily enough.  Your next step is to download them to your computer but it may be confusing because they give you 4 links.  You'll need the MP3+G link.  You'll need to download them to your computer then unzip them and then copy them to a USB Flash drive or burn them to a CD.  This was just a little bit time consuming.  Not hard but for some people but I know many that would have a hard time figuring it out.Microphone/Remote Operation- The microphone also acts as the remote.  It's easy enough to switch threw songs and Play/Pause the music but it's pretty slow and delayed.  There is a menu button that allows you to adjust the mic & music volume.  It's also supposed to pull your songs up on the screen but for us it only does that when you first insert the flash drive.  The only way we can get through the songs is to keep skipping through which takes a lot of time depending on how many songs you have.  The microphone is the worst thing about this machine.  We can barely hear ourselves it's so quiet.  We've done everything necessary, adjusting the TV volume, turning the mic volume to the max and even ended up turning the music volume all the way down.  Unless we cup our hand around the top of the mic and sing directly into our cupped hands we can't hear ourselves.  I'm not sure what the problem is.  We have 2 of these machine on 2 different TV's and nothing we do makes it any better.This machine seems like something you'd find 20 years ago other than in the looks department.  It's very primitive.  The whole point of a Karaoke Player is to be able to hear yourself and we can't the way it's supposed to be done.  I'm sorry to say but I wouldn't recommend this product.
