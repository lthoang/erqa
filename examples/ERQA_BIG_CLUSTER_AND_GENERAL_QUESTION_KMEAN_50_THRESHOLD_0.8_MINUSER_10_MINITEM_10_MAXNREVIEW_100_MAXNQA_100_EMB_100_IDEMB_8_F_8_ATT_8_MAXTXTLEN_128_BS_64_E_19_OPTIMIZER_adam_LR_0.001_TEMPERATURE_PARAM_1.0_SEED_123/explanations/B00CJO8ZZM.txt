Hi! Does the puppy include nursery rhymes or only stories?
Top review:
"With young kids and multiple nephew, nieces, and family friends, we definitely cannot have enough kid toys around.  Having purchased theFisher-Price Laugh & Learn Love to Play Puppy with Bonus CD, it was exciting for the kids to try out the Laugh and Learn Singin' Storytime Puppy.  When the kids got the chance to play with the two toys side to side, we noticed the older kids (2-3 years) were more inclined to play with theFisher-Price Laugh & Learn Love to Play Puppy with Bonus CDsimply because it was softer and more huggable.  My younger and less mobile niece (1 year old) found the Singin' Storytime Puppy very engaging and happily sat next to the toy pushing the buttons over and over.The Singin' Storytime Puppy is really more of a ""playtime puppy"" verses a ""bedtime puppy"".  The entire toy is hard all around, with the feet and hands being the softest parts on the body.  It sits just a little bit taller than the Love to Play Puppy, and is skinnier than the LtPP mainly because there is very little stuffing in the toy.  It's voice is much clearer and doesn't sound muffled in comparison to the LtPP, and it's just a little more high pitch.  The big thing that the kids loved about this toy is that it moves a LOT.  The puppy balances neatly on a round bottom and flails its arms and body around as it sings or tells stories.  My niece also liked the book that's attached to  it as she can easily turn the one page back and forth and the puppy makes mention of the items on the page.When it comes to bedtime, this pup most likely won't make it comfortably in the bed.  Because the body and book are so hard, it's probably best left out of anyone's bed.  This is where the Love to Play Puppy trumps this toy.  Because of it's size and hard body, it probably isn't the best candidate to bring on trips with the kid.  All in all, this is a fun toy for young kids to play with.  I'm not really convinced it would be played with in the long run because of the limitations it has a toy and as a stuffed animal, but it certainly is amusing enough to have around the house to keep kids entertained for a while."

Update 4/8/2014:My now 8 month old son still does not care for this toy.  When I get it out and play with him, he will stare at it intently for awhile, and then look away.  There really is not too much to play with on this puppy.  You can press one of two choices on his feet, either story or song.  While the puppy sings or tells a silly little story, he rocks back and forth.  Sometimes he rocks so much he falls over.  His bottom is rounded to enable him to rock.  Based on my child's experience, I do not recommend this puppy.  I suggest purchasing the 'Love to Play Puppy.'  My son still smiles and lights up when we play with that puppy.My 3 month old absolutely loves his 'Laugh and Learn Love to Play Puppy' by Fisher Price.  His eyes light up and he starts smiling right away when he sees it, therefore when I saw this, I thought it would be a big hit.  Not so much.  The first moment he saw it, he started smiling until he realized it wasn't the same puppy.  He watched it for a couple of minutes, then became fussy.  I thought he was just over-stimulated because we had been playing with other toys first.  The second time we got it out, he actually started crying.  Now, he just looks away after a few moments.  It is rated for 6+ months and I thought that was just because they couldn't actually play with it by themselves due to lack of motor skills, but now I'm wondering if it's too much for a 3 month old or if he truly doesn't like it.  For the price, I would stick with the regular puppy.  It's gotten great reviews and why try to make something better when the original is pretty good?  But because I may have purchased this puppy too early for my child, I will re-visit this review in a couple of months.
I'm not going to lie, at first I thought this you looked a bit creepy. But, when we tried it out, it turned out to be a really cute toy! The puppy' s little voice is very cute and it is so much fun to see it rock back and forth while it sings and laughs. It includes a lot of different songs and phrases. Very cute toy!
When all else fails, I can always calm down my daughter with Puppy and the Fisher-Price apps. There are several of them, and they are free downloads. This is how my daughter and I first learned about Puppy & Lil&#8217; Sis. This Puppy toy is so super cute. He not only sings and tells stories, but he rocks back and forth. Sometimes with such vigor that he falls over. Fiona thinks this is pretty funny when it happens. Although Puppy does have a lot of songs and a lot of stories, he says the same thing when you open and close the book. Over and over. And that&#8217;s mostly what Fiona does, open and close the book. I do wish the book had a little more variety to it, but the toy is still cute and my daughter still likes it.
This toy is perfect for my one year old. If there are two things he likes to do is play with interactive toys, and hug and smush his face into plush dolls. This toy is the best when we need to give him alone time in his playpen. When he is in that transitional time after he is done playing but needs an interesting activity to calm him down and get him to rest, this seems to be the perfect diversion that he always gets engrossed with until he is ready to lay down. Its big and sturdy, and is entertaining. It seems to be a lot more interesting to him than similar My Pay Scout toy,
The Laugh & Learn toy is an attractive-colorful toy that is not gender specific.  Once the toy is switched on it is easy to activate both intentionally and accidentally by moving it which is great for small children as they learn to navigate the world around them.  This toy is entertaining and informative teaching the child to count, learn the alphabet, and to look for objects.  The voice used in the songs & stories is charming and clear.  This toy can easily be incorporated in your teaching/interactive time with the child.  This is not what would be called a cuddly toy; it has soft paws but the base and arms are hard to allow the motion capabilities. The toy has good variety of songs and stories working on visual and auditory cues.  Safe with no small or loss parts to harm the child.Drawbacks: Packaging is hard to open and the battery compartment has four screws for access.  Parents should check the toy's arms & legs from time to time since they contain wires. Price is high for todays economy.
Long time ago when I saw the puppy sing the ABC song, I was very taken by it. Then I didnt know that the ABC song is so popular.Whats great about this puppy is its motion. My 20 month old daughter followed the puppy in its moving to the sides and bringing the hands together motion, as soon as we got it going. The book worm is cute when it lights up. When the kids sit down, the puppy is close to their size and eye level. For this reason, the puppy becomes their pal very soon.
The Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Singin' Storytime Puppy is a lot of fun for a child six months and up.  He rocks and he wiggles and the music is so cute.  Little ones love the movement and the sound and really have a blast playing with the puppy.  Definitely a toy that I recommend for a really young child.
"Such a cute doggie! Very durable, holds baby's attention visually with bright color details, a variety of stories and songs as well as a little light-up worm on the upper corner of the book.  As he introduces numbers and colors in dialog, songs and stories, he moves his arms and nods his head.  Initially each time I pressed one of the feet (this activates the sound) I heard the same intro recording, but as I pressed multiple times in a row, the dog sang different songs and told different little short stories.  Very entertaining! It has mostly a soft stuffed animal surface..... perfectly soft and gum-able for a teething baby, but does have a hard plastic ""book"" on it's belly that should handle a babies drooling just fine.  It's bottom has a curved, roly-poly base that when you push, or pull and let go, he wobbles back and forth.  I can see this entertaining doggie bringing a lot of cooing and giggles out of any baby."

"I ordered this toy for my cousin's toddler, who is just a bit over 16 months old.  Joey adored the toy from the very beginning.  He quickly caught on, with the help of older brother Brandon (who is nearly five), how to keep the puppy reading and singing by turning the pages of the book.  In fact, it was Brandon who figured out the toy and taught Joey how to use it completely, a testament to the user-friendliness and age-appropriateness of this toy.  I thought the price might be a little high, but I must say it had provided hours of fun and laughter, as well as a good learning experience for Joey.  I would guess that this would make a good ""from the grandparents"" toy, simply because of the price.  I definitely recommend it--and the batteries are included, something I wish would become industry standard.Update:  After speaking with people who are more accustomed to purchasing toys than I am, I am going to change my opinion of the price.  One person I spoke with said, ""Thirty five bucks?  For a puppy that sings and reads and moves?  That is really reasonable.""  So I think I may be living in the previous century when it comes to price.  This is a delightful toy, and I think any toddler would love it."
This little puppy is so much fun. This toy has the sweetest little voice I have heard in a long time in an animated toy. The puppy talks very positive and cheerful he sings, he barks, he counts, he tells stories. If the baby even bats at the puppies paws he will make comments or Bark or giggle its so cute. If you turn the pages of the book he talks about what's on the page. I think children even a little past the 36 month age top will even want to play with puppy.Brings back memories of weebles wobble but they don't fall down. Puppy gets rocking pretty hard but has not fallen on carpet. Make sure you move the switch on the bottom to on from demo so you get all his 40 + songs and stories. It does require a phillips head screwdriver to remove the toy from the box.It is so cute it may sit out and if I'm having a blue day just listening to this cute fellow laugh puts a smile on your face. Highly recommended this toy, it is learning and fun all rolled into one.
"I chose this puppy toy for my (almost) 12 month old baby, Muffin.  Unlike her two year old twin siblings, Muffin likes to play alone, and I hoped this toy would stimulate her.  This is the first toy we have owned in the ""Fisher Price Puppy"" line, and I am very pleased with it.  Muffin loves the bright lights as well as the songs and stories. Unlike some other battery operated toys, this is not an ""annoying"" toy, the music as well as speaking is pleasant and does not grate on the nerves.  My 2 year old twins also like the puppy, and they probably get more ""educational"" value from the puppy than my 12 month old does, but all three of them get a lot of fun playtime from this puppy."
This toy is so great for baby and mom. I love the volume setting where you can turn it down for the little ones that play it over and over and over lol My grandson loves this and yes he is one who plays it over and over :) But he has already learned a few of the songs and he loves the storybook telling. He has already learned some of his abc's and can count also. Great little learning toy for little ones.
"I love this puppy. We've had a previous version and loved that one, as well. I'd say it'd be suitable for babies than can sit. It is easy to press the buttons and his ears get chewed on, frequently. He sings and ""reads"" from his little book. I just wish he were softer. There has to be a way to make this toy more cuddly. Its previous model was way snugglier."
Talking dolls are pretty common these days, but what helps set this guy apart is he rocking motion as he talks.  He rocks back and forth, and often he looks as if he is going to fall over but somehow he keeps his balance.  Puppy's vocabulary is pretty diverse so hopefully parents won't grow tired of the hearing the same phrase too frequently.  Puppy isn't always intuitive on how to get it to talk.  You squeeze the bottom feet or turn the page on the book.  You'd think that squeezing the front paws would activate the doll as they have a similar look to the bottom paws (with words on them) but the do not.  Puppy comes with batteries which I always find a nice touch.  For the price, this puppy is good deal for all the features it offers.
"I like most Fisher-Price toys.  Many have become much loved favorites of my children, and now my grandchildren.  I don't see this happening with this one.  About all they can do it push the button on the right foot to get a song or press the one on the left for a story.  It rocks back and forth while performing.  That's about it.  It will be a novelty for a brief period, but I expect it will be quickly forgotten after they get bored pushing a button.  There is a little educational value in the songs and stories, but it's pretty minimal.  It takes ""C"" batteries."
I got this toy for my 6 month old grandson, though his 2 year 9 month old sister likes to help him play with it. This is a colorful, stimulating and creative toy that is entertaining and educational up to about 2 years old, but not much beyond. My granddaughter definitely has no interest in playing with this on her own. My grandson on the other hand finds it fascinating and easy to use.Note: The packaging on this is ridiculous. You need a Phillips screwdriver to remove two screws from a plastic bracket just to take this out of the box. You will also need your Phillips screwdriver to remove the screws in the battery compartment to change the batteries once they are exhausted. This takes four C batteries.
Very cute toy.  His movements are a bit dramatic for some smaller children, so they could be slow to warm up to him.  And even though his top paws would seem to activate him, as they do have patches on them, they do not.  Only the bottom 2 pays animate him.
I gave this to my son for his first birthday, and surprisingly, he seems pretty ambivalent about it!  He's had the Fisher-Price Laugh & Learn Love to Play Puppy since he was 6 months and it's been one of his favorite toys, so I thought he'd love this, but he's pretty much ignored it...  One thing that's very different from the Love to Play Puppy is that this toy only has 2 buttons - one on each foot.  The hands are NOT buttons.  When you flip the page of the book, it recites a little poem.  But overall, this seems to say WAY less than the Love to Play Puppy.  And yes, it moves and talks, but it has to be sitting upright (which is hard when you're a baby playing with a toy), and the noises of the mechanism almost totally drown out the voice!  My husband says it sounds like an electric drill!I reccomend the Love to Play Puppy instead!Fisher Price Laugh Learn Love Puppy
My almost 17 month old son absolutely loves this toy. He is into musical, noisy things so I knew right away he would enjoy this. It's not as grating as some other toys and it really keeps him entertained for a while. This puppy is made very well, nice and durable (already mishandled quite a few times) and so far, the batteries that it came with have lasted for about a month now. The toy is a nice size, bright and cheery and almost everywhere you touch produces some sort of sound. There are MANY songs it plays and I think 6 different stories it 'reads'. There really is enough here to justify the cost, and ideal for babies from about 8 months and up. I hope this toy lasts because it's one of my son's go-to toys and he really doesn't play with many others on a regular basis. Fisher-Price is a great brand, always developing new and fun toys for kids of all ages, and this is no exception.
There are two parts to the toy - the puppy itself and the book.About the puppy - first of all, it cute and pretty well sized so that you can baby/toddler can actually feel it.  It is well built to last all the abuses.When you flip the pages, the toy reads different stories when you squeeze a paw.  If you squeeze another paw, it sings.Overall - my twins are loving this toy.
