This is a pump action vs trigger, so recommended for 6+ years of age. It's a touch on the large side and hard to maneuver for anyone younger. It is lightweight and we didn't experience any leaking. The cap to refill is on top and tethered, thus less likely to lose it. The tank holds a decent amount of water when compared to others like it, but nothing stands out to me that makes this a stellar product when compared to others. The price seems high. I do like Nerf products and trust them not to wear down. This is pretty durable and the kids enjoyed playing with it.

The Nerf Super Soaker Crossbow is one neat water blaster. If you&#8217;re in the mood for a summer water battle, this is the water gun for you. The water tank holds a good amount of water and this gun can shoot a stream over 15 feet with good pressure. You can fold the crossbow arms inward and shoot a single stream, or open the crossbow arms and have three streams at once. This is great fun for the family.
My 7 year old and 10 year old loved this gun.  I measured the firing range and it does shoot a pretty good stream around 30 feet. What most surprised me was that shooting all three streams at once did not noticeably reduce the firing range.  It runs out of water pretty fast, but you can absolutely soak someone with this.  It is a very fun gun.
If you use it in the three stream mode, it is not that strong and it cannot shoot as far.On the other hand, it's very durable.  It's easy to refill and it's lots of fun.My boys are going to have a blast.  We also have the Nerf pump style one that should almost as far.
My 3 kids ages 4, 7, and 10 really enjoy this water gun. They have several guns to use for their epic water gun fights and this is one of their favorites. My oldest especially likes to shoot it out of one of the holes in order to get a very long range of spray.  It is easy to fill, easy to shoot, appears durable, has stood up to getting thrown on the ground on multiple occasional.  Per the 10 year old when I asked his opinion, &#34;It is great!&#34;
This soaker has few drawbacks. One might wish it had a bigger tank, but if it held more water it would get pretty heavy for kids. Overall, it shoots well and has a good range. The &#34;tri strike&#34; design might just be a gimmick, but it's a gimmick kids seem to like. My nephew even likes playing with this by himself -- he sets up targets and has fun practicing his aim.This is solidly built and inexpensive for the fun it provides. Thumbs up.
I received this one at the same time as the Blast, and there's really not much of a comparison between the two.  While this one does have a couple of minor faults, overall it's an excellent option that should see plenty of use over these next few months.Pros- holds 40 ounces, which allows for a fair amount of shooting before the need to refill- huge shooting range, with 35 feet being pretty typical on a hard pump- ability to shoot three streams at once- easy to aim- carried easily with one arm, thanks to easy grip handleCons- with three streams, shooting range reduces drastically- trigger option would have allowed for better aimOf the two guns we received, this is easily the better choice and it compares favorably with similar products from other makers that we have tried.  This is sure to provide a ton of fun times around the pool, and I'd recommend it to anyone considering such a purchase.
Quick Thoughts&#9674; Shoots three streams of water&#9674; Pump gauge&#9674; Holds about 40oz. of water&#9674; Shoots about 30 feet&#9674; Mildly solid construction, but caution should be used with the crossbow arms are extendedFinal sayThis is a new iteration to the Super Soaker family. While multi-stream is nothing new, the use of a crossbow idea is kind of a different take in the world of water gun wars. I suggest this item as a buy.
I haven't shot a Super Soaker in years, so I was pretty excited to try this one out.  The design is cool, and it feels sturdy without being heavy.  Doesn't feel like its going to crack if you drop it on the driveway.  One big bummer was the lack of a trigger.  The Soaker is fired by pumping the barrel.  The green area on the underside of the barrel acts like a pump shotgun.  You pull out to 'load' then you pump it back to fire.  It decreases accuracy, but the streams are pretty thick.  My 4-year-old niece is pretty tough, and she tried playing with it, but just wasn't big enough or strong enough to aim and pump the gun.  She was kinda able to fire it straight up into the air, holding the barrel close to her face.I counted shots when totally full.  I think it was 61 shots with the single stream, or if you slide a switch, the crossbow arms pop out and it fires three shots - about 45 times on a full tank.Overall, its missing that satisfying trigger-pull, but it will soak whoever you're chasing around, as long as you're tall and strong enough to reach both the stock and the barrel.Pros:- Sturdy design- Strong blast; thick streams of water- Approx. 60 shots on a full tank with single stream, 45 with the crossbow arms extended- Easy to fill and fires until fairly empty- Cool effect flipping a switch and having the crossbow arms pop outCons:- No trigger- Recommended ages 6 and up should be followed; too hard for small children to pump
This is great for 8-10 year olds, the right size, easy to fill and use and lots of fun!  With bows being so popular now, it's definitely a favorite!
It needs a larger capacity water-tank for less frequent refills, but that's really my only criticism. This thing is fun.My kids love it, and it's a great toy for summer. Use it with the crossbow arms extended. It has multiple streams and shoots about 30 feet (I didn't measure but seems accurate).I have to admit, I enjoy soaking the kids with this on hot days.
Nerf Super Soaker Barrage is a pump action water gun that can hold a lot of water and has three different modes of water spray.  I enjoy the way the water just streams out of the Super Soaker.  I use it to wet my dogs last weekend to cool them off and give them a little excitement and fun.  The problem I have with it is the water container tends to dribble out so If you're in a water fight with your friends you better use it or lose it.I have to recommend the Super Soaker for kids or for those who are nostalgic for the original Super Soakers.
Good fun and I like how it has multiple jets.I don't like how it has the crossbow arms that swing out, its easy to poke people in close quarters and it just makes it a bit too big for my liking.I like my double barreled super soaker better.Overall its very fun, and the quality is good.
This toy is officially declared a SUCCESS.  Fun for big kids and bigger kids (aka: adults).  Do to weight when filled and size, recommended for not-tiny kids.  Doesn't hold TONS of water, this is a mid sized soaker, but the shape makes it extra fun to shoot.  Would buy again.  I might even get an extra....  Game on!
I admit, when this &#34;water gun&#34; arrived I had to be the first to try it out.  With the storage compartment completely full of water it's pretty heavy, especially for little arms.  But it's so fun to squirt that the kids don't mind at all.  It's really easy to pop out the &#34;bow&#34; part or pop them back in to make it go from three streams of water down to one stream.  It goes pretty far.  I'd say the water squirts about 20' easily.  It's pretty durable and lots of fun in these hot days we've been having.  My kids have even used it to &#34;wash&#34; my car.  LOL!
I was debating on giving this to my son but after getting a grip on this baby and hitting the button to flip out the arms, it's all mines!!! Nerf continues to impress me with the quality of the products they produce. I think the price is fair, this thing is a pretty solidly built toy, love it!

My son loves this Nerf water gun! He has owned a few&#8212;on the expensive side&#8212;but he has enjoyed this one the most. In the past, Nerf has never failed me as a product, so I did not expect this product to disappoint, which it has not. First off, it is light, it does not leak, and it shoots far! Additionally, the quality of the gun does not feel cheap. Most water guns we have owned crack easily and do not hold much water, but this one hold a nice amount for a round of fun in the sun. Although the product is slightly pricey, my son has convinced me to get him a second one for more family fun.
First of all I didn't even receive this super soaker, I received a completely separate one - the Barrage Soaker. The Barrage is actually a lesser quality model than the Tri Strike, and it certainly shows. The Barrage is leaky and doesn't shoot a decent stream. I wish I could give a proper review for the Tri Strike but I can't considering the item I was sent. If something changes and I receive the Tri Strike for review, I will certainly update this review.
We live in a place where it's already hitting HOT summer temps. In the summer it can exceed 115 degrees. Anything cool and wet and refreshing is a life saver. This one is going to be a big hit. The family is already enjoying it. It works well, it's a nice impressive size and the kids love it.
I must confess that I am hardly an expert in squirtguns - there are surely more informed reviews than mine for this product.  That being said, I find the Nerf Super Soaker Tri-Strike Crossbow soaker to be an ordinary, if perfectly acceptable squirtgun when used in its single-stream option.This is coming from a guy who grew up with the little 99-cent plastic squirtgun that drenched your hand while squirting at 15-degree angle about eight feet.  Some of this is due to the fact that I am not quite able to comprehend the investment in a squirtgun that this Nerf product requires.  We seem to have emerged into a generation of high performance squirtguns, but I suppose if we live in an age of artisinal butter and gourmet french fries, I've got to roll with the times.On the good side, this Nerf gun holds a fair amount of water (40 ounces) and when used in its single-stream setting shoots quite a distance.  I can get a decent stream of water well over 30 feet, which is a quantum leap over where I used to play in the squirt gun arms race.  The Nerf gun converts into &#34;crossbow&#34; form fairly efficiently, but when it does so the distance severely flags and you don't get the target that much wetter than you do in the single-stream setting.  (It does look cool, however.)I also liked the convenient water-filling port.Does this re-invent the squirtgun?  No.  Is it fun?  Yes.
I love that this super soaker (which is the upteenth one we've tried) works well for all of my kids (ages 5-12). It's easy to load with water from the outside faucet because the green circle on top unscrews and has an ample hole for filling. It holds a good amount of water so it doesn't need to be refilled constantly. The crossbow action pops out with the press of a button and will then shoot three streams of water (less forcefully than when you have them folded in and the water is coming out the main part). There is no trigger. Simply pump the slider thing underneath, and as you pull it towards your body the water shoots out. This is awesome for my littlest guy because he can shoot the gun as well as his brothers can. Overall I think this is well-designed, sturdy, and easy to use.I asked my kids if there was any downside to it. The younger ones said no, they love it, but the oldest (age 12) complained that it sometimes leaks down his arm while he's shooting. I don't see that as a con because they are outside to get wet anyways, but if you just wanted to sit on your porch and shoot cats or something, it might bug you :)
I have been saving this for Mother's Day since that is the one day when I can get away with most anything and boy were my girls surprised.  I was sitting on their porch and they came out the door and bang they got a good blast of water.  Got them both at the same time too which was sweet since this has three streams of water when the crossbow is out.  We had so much fun with it all afternoon.  It was actually warm here in New Hampshire so it was a perfect time to try out this toy and yes I'm am a big kid at heart especially when it comes to go ole fashioned toys that bring back fond memories.  This holds quite a bit of water and the only thing I wasn't impressed with that where you put the water in.  It takes longer to put it in than it does to empty it because you can just hook up the garden hose to it and fill quickly.  Other than that it does just what it claims to.  The streams go a really good distance and you can't miss if you use the crossbow feature instead of just the regular watergun.  I recommend this for those who have kids or are big kids themselves.  Summer is so much more fun when you're creating mischief.
The only negative thing about this gun is how often it needs to be refilled. I wish it came with a holdng tank that could be worn as a backpack and a line into the gun's water storage.That said, my 8yr old would sleep with this if I let him. This is already his favorite outside toy. His favorite feature seems to be the flip out crossbow look. He loves using the triple stream action. There are lots of drenched victims who would agree.Skip the mess of water balloons and get this instead
Nerf Super Soaker Barrage Soaker arrived instead of the Tri Strike Crossbow Soaker. The Barrage holds a lot of water, so gets very heavy and it tends to leak. It is pump action, so takes a little strength and coordination to get it to be relatively efficient. It has three modes, but only one was every really used, the others were like misting. My 8 year old likes it as a big gun, but I really had hoped for something more inventive, like the Crossbow to arrive.
