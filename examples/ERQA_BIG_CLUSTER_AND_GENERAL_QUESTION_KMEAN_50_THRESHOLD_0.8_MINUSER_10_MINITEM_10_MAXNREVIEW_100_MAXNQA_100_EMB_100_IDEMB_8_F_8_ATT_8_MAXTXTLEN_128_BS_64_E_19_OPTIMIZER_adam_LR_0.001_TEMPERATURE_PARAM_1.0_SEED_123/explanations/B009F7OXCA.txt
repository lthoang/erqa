"Our girls love this voice activated, private, spylike journal.  I grew up having diaries with little locks on them.  Here they have passwords, invisible ink(Hey! We had that.) that shows up under the glow light, and a secret compartment.It's pink(But not Barbie, but one could pretend that way) and plastic and about book size.  It requires 3 AA's(not included, one screw on the back) and there's a simple page of instructions.  It does include the notebook and invisible ink pen.Inside, it has 4 buttons: Record options, Record/Select, Glow Light, and the Security Button- which allows security settings of High(Must speak password very clearly and loud enough), Low(not as sensitve) and off(no password).  It is very important to speak clearly into the microphone when recording at a 1 foot distance in a quiet setting, i.e., no background noise, or you'll have problems.  It allows you to record a greeting, a sign off and a alert or warning- such as- ""I'm going to tell Mom!""The glow light shows the invisible writing and can be changed to a show light or normal light for a normal pen.  It shuts off after 3 minutes on it's own.  The secret compartment lies beneeth the notebook, and one can replace the notebook with one of similar size.There's a place for the pen; it's easy to reset the messages, although, it will erase what you have.  The kids learned it quickly and have a lot of fun with it.  Clever, kid approved idea.  We've had no problems."

Reviews:
I just got this in the mail yesterday and my daughter has been showing me all the cool features and she really likes it.First off, she got to record a password. She told me that even if someone guesses her password they still can't open it because it not only retains the password, but also the voice that recorded it. She finds this to be a really cool feature. It also lets you record a message to anyone that tries to break into it, and a welcome message to her for whenever she opens it.Now for the inside. Once open, it has a small spiral notebook tucked inside that can be removed (so when they fill it up they can replace it). It also has an invisible ink pen and a special light to be able to read that ink. The special light also has a switch on it to turn it into a regular book light to use with regular pens, if they want to write at night, in bed, under the covers.  There is also some room to hold a few pens or pencils.The only thing my daughter complained about just a little is that being left-handed, it was not that comfortable for her to write with the notebook tucked into the holder, but then she just decided she would remove it to write and then replace it when done. So I guess all in all that wasn't too much of a problem.I've been trying to get her to start a journal and she hasn't really been into the idea, so this is nice to get her into it. We are both very happy with this item and recommend it to others.
This electronic diary will not turn a young non-scribe into a dedicated diarist. But for a kid with a literary bent, this is a nice way to make keeping a journal more fun. Although plastic, the diary is not badly made. The voice-triggered password needs some finessing, but that's true of any voice-capture tech. All in all, this is a good option for young writers.
What girl doesn't want to keep her innermost thoughts hidden from prying eyes? This password journal is an electronic way to do just that. Included is the journal case, one spiral bound notebook and one invisible ink pen. The notebook and pen were inside the journal when it arrived, along with an attached glow light to read the invisible ink. The journal requires 3 AA batteries, not included, and the batteries need to be inserted before the journal will open. Once the batteries are inserted, just press the grey access button and the cover springs open. There is also a tiny reset button located on outside of the journal case in the upper right hand corner. Pressing the reset button with a pen or other small object will reset the password and/or open the journal without using the password. It also erases any customized messages that have been recorded previously.Inside are four buttons: glow, security, record options and record/select. The glow buttons toggles between off/light/invisible ink light while the security button switches between high/low/off levels of protection. The record options button allows you to record password/greeting/alert/sign-off and the record/select button enters your choice. The directions on initial setup are easy to follow and any notebook of a similar size can be substituted when the included notebook is full.Overall, this is a cute (albeit) slightly pricey way to keep thoughts private. My main complaint is that there doesn't seem to be any volume control and this journal is loud. Thankfully, once programmed you only hear the greeting and goodbye but it's still rather jarring. Also, as you can reset the journal when need be by pressing a button on the outside, it's not really 'secret', but should be adequate to keep siblings at bay. My daughter's been using is regularly for a couple of weeks now and she really likes it.
"In the box it's not real exciting--not quite as slick-looking as I imagined from the picture. You have to install three AA batteries before it can even open. The first thing we do is open it and look for the compartment (At first she was disappointed when it didn't already have treasure in it, but thinks it's neat she can add her own). Then we tried the light. It's cool. She can use the black light to see the secret writing she does (so fun) and the plain light to see non-secret writing when she's in the dark. I love that it is attached so she cannot lose it. One of the most fun aspects which we figured out without the instructions was how to record something when you open the journal and when you close the journal. So for hers, when we open it my voice says ""Welcome to my journal"" and when she closes it soon her voice comes on and says ""Jelly Beans"" which seriously cracks her up. My biggest criticism is that the journal will become filled pretty quickly. I don't think it will be hard to fit another pad of paper in there when that happens. I think this would be a well-appreciated gift for any young girl. As old as 13, as young as 6 (if she'll take care of it)."
This journal has gotten a lot of use by my 10 year old daughter.  The voice password functionality is very cool and actually very high end for such a cheap toy.  My daughter is able to record a password in her voice, and if anyone else tries to say the same password, it will not open.  It only opens if it's her voice.She is able to get it to open with her voice about 8 times out of 10.  Not too shabby.  I think the key is to record the password in as normal a voice as you can.  Any strain in your voice, or if you use an uncommon word, then it doesn't work as well.  It is also better to choose a shorter password, rather than a whole sentence.My daughter showed this to her neighborhood friends and they all thought it was super cool, and now they want one.  If you have a daughter between the ages of about 7-10, I think this will be a huge hit.The one drawback is that the sound is very loud and cannot be adjusted.  I can literally hear this toy from anywhere in our house.  This is in fact a complaint from my daughter, too.  She doesn't like the fact that when she goes to record a password, pretty much everyone can hear her doing it.The built in reading light, invisible ink, secret compartment just make this toy even awesome-er.  Battery life has been great as we are still on the original set, after much use.All in all, this toy is a hit that we highly recommend.
"The password journal makes having it way more fun to own. Little girls can feel like they have something that is theirs, and no ones else's. It has paper and some storage inside, which is a nice addition for girls, so they can keep writing utensils and maybe a treasured eraser or two. My daughter squealed when i told her no one else can get into her journal. she's 5, so i highly doubt anything too secretive is going is here. So far its been ""i love mom and dad"" ""i love gizmo(her dog)"" but its still exciting for her nonetheless. i am planning on buying one for my friends daughter whom is turning 9. i believe she will love it."
Whatever that age group is, my niece loved it.  Sleek design with a cool hidden compartment that is also password protected. Keeps secrets safe and sound while using a black light  how cool is that?
Our niece just turned eight, and this was the only gift she had asked for for her birthday.  She absolutely loves it!When we visited them this past weekend, she showed me how it works.  What is great is that it is voice-activated by the person who owns it, which means that her nosy little brother can't open it.  :-)It has some invisible ink and a nice pad of paper inside.It makes a nice gift for a young girl!
I really really wish I had this as child!!!  I remember seeing journals like this and drooling over them (was poor, didn't have money for frivolous things, heck I started a paper route and bought all my own clothes by age 13), but this one is far sleeker and prettier than any of the voice passworded journals I have seen before, it is simply amazing looking.The voice activation works great, yes it is a bit loud, so its not like its gonna be a secret you're writing in it, but that really isn't the point.  The point is that your brothers/parents can't get in to it.  :D  Unless your have some industrious brothers who are very clever, they wont, not without obvious proof.Love the color, love the style, some how well it works, only wish that it had more pages.God Bless ~Amy
Pink. Girls like pink. And purple. And blue. Those three colors; pink, purple, and blue seem to be the main colors for girls in the 9-11 age group. A diary that locks with the strong potential to keep snooping younger siblings and hopefully parents out of private thoughts. Wonderful! Got this for my daughter and so far she loves it. Have not had any issues with unlocking the deivce or her using it. Good choice.
"I picked this up for my grand-daughter (6 years old) and she loves it.  She's spent a lot of time practicing her writing using the invisible ink and then excitedly showing me the messages with the special lamp that reveals the messages.  We did find that the audio-password was ""challenging"" and ended up disabling that feature but really it is probably because she is only 6 and doesn't always enunciation exactly the same way.  It could also be that she just needs to pick a simple password with one or two syllables  I would not let that discourage purchasing this product."
When my daughter turned 12, she asked for a diary for her birthday, and I got her this one. She loves it. The voice-activated password is a great addition--it keeps her brother out. She also loves writing notes with the invisible pen!
Every little girl dreams of having a safe place to keep her secret!  This product fits the bill.  It opens only to her voice saying the secret password.  On top of that it includes a pen that writes in invisible ink that shows up only when the special light hits the paper.  Both of my daughters have this toy and enjoy it very much!
"Our girls love this voice activated, private, spylike journal.  I grew up having diaries with little locks on them.  Here they have passwords, invisible ink(Hey!

It is very important to speak clearly into the microphone when recording at a 1 foot distance in a quiet setting, i.e., no background noise, or you'll have problems.  It allows you to record a greeting, a sign off and a alert or warning- such as- ""I'm going to tell Mom!""The glow light shows the invisible writing and can be changed to a show light or normal light for a normal pen.  It shuts off after 3 minutes on it's own.

The kids learned it quickly and have a lot of fun with it.  Clever, kid approved idea.  We've had no problems."
My daughter loved this out of the box. Very neat for any child to have a secure spot for their journal with a secret compartment. The voice-automated opening is neat, and worked almost every time for her. As with many toys though, she quickly lost interest in it when the novelty wore off. But I'm sure she'll come back to it from time to time.
"My daughter enjoyed this at first, but no longer uses it. She said the password worked best in ""low"" mode because she had to be too ""exact"" when it was in high security mode. She also said that the greeting and farewell was too loud, with no volume control. This is a problem for little girls who are supposed to be sleeping and are writing in their journals instead. (Yep... she got caught! &lt;smile>). Overall, she said it was okay, but she lost interest in it pretty quickly."
I got this as a gift for my niece and she has enjoyed it, but as with most toys, it seems to outlive its usefulness rather quickly...or perhaps she just has too many toys.  The Password Journal 8 is a cute, pink diary that is protected by an electronic password so her secrets are sure to be safe, since the journal can only be opened when the password is spoken.  It has a hidden compartment that opens with a second password and it includes an invisible pen and a black light to guarantee those young secrets stay between her and her journal.  So far it has proven to be a durable product.
"My 11-year-old daughter has told me about these Password Journals before and was really interested in them.  She has friends who have them and she thought they were really neat.  I got this one for her to try and we were quite impressed.Set Up- It was amazingly easy to set up and get started.  I thought there would be a little more to it but the instructions were quite easy to follow and we had it going in a minute or so.Password & Other Recordings- She was worried at first about having me or her brother hear her set up her password because she figured we'd be able to get into it but I assured it that it should only open to her voice.  After she set the password and was able to get into it a few times I tried to say her password and it wouldn't allow me to open it.  She was quite excited about that.  Not only was she able to say the password but she can also record her own greeting and goodbye message to herself.  And her favorite one is when someone tries to open it it'll give them a recorded message from her which she chose to say ""Busted"".Notebook- The notebook itself is a bit on the small side.  It would've been nice if the tablet had been quite a bit larger than it is.  It's more useful for notes than it is for like a diary or something.  The invisible ink pen and black light was a neat addition that she enjoys.Secret Compartment- The secret compartment is neat as well.  She had ideas such as keeping money or gift cards in there.  It's not very big though so you won't be storing much in there.Volume- It would've been nice to have a volume adjuster.  It's a bit on the loud side.Overall we think this is a really cool, fun thing and we'd recommend it.  I think most girls 8-13 would enjoy having something like this."
