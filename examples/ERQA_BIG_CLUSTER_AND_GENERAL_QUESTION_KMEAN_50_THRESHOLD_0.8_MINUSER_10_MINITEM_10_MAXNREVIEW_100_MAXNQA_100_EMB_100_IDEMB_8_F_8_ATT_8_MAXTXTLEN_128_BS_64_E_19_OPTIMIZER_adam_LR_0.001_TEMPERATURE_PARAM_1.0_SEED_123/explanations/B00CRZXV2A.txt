Top review:
"To start with, let me say we are a family that owns three Tag Readers, two Tag Juniors, one each of Leapster, Leapster 2 and Leapster Explorer, and at one point we also bought a LeapPad but hated it so much that we returned it after one day.I received this new LeapReader, which is an update to the Tag Reader, for review. In the package I also received two LeapReader books,LeapFrog LeapReader Book: Leap and the Lost Dinosaur (works with Tag)andLeapFrog LeapReader Book: Learn to Write Numbers with Mr. Pencil.A quick overview: the LeapReader adds new functionalities to the Tag Reader, including stand-alone audiobooks and music player. It also comes with a built-in rechargeable battery as opposed to alkalines in the Tag Reader.  In case you have never seen a Tag Reader before, the LeapReader uses an optical recognition system that picks up information on specially printed paper (basically paper with tiny little dotted patterns that tell the LeapReader which book, which page and which ""hot spot"" the tip is scanning, and the on-board little computer can then play the respective content.)The out-of-package experience has been overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer's sheet claims that the two included books in the review kit had been pre-installed. Not true. To my unpleasant surprise, only the dinosaur book was playable out of the box. The Mr. Pencil book was not installed, and, worse, the sample book that's included in every retail package was also not installed!Anyone who's ever used a Leapfrog ""smart"" educational toy before knows how bad their Leapfrog Connect program is. This is the program that you MUST install on a PC in order to download audio content to the LeapReader (much as with the older Tag and Tag Junior). When I read on the packaging that I must use the Leapfrog Connect program again, my heart skipped a beat and my blood pressure went up.  I really hated that program.  (Don't ask me why we kept buying Leapfrog products...)I'm happy to report that the updated Leapfrog Connect program is as buggy as ever.  First of all, like any half-smart computer user, I use a Standard User account 100% of the time (so to shield my system from potential viral attacks).  If you have an older version of LeapFrog Connect installed on your computer,  you must log into the Administrator account in order to update it!  Seriously, Leapfrog.  Any decent Windows program would update under the User Account Control, without the user's having to log into the Admin account separately.  So now I had to log into my Admin account, which I had never had to do once since getting this Lenovo laptop over a year ago.  That was annoying.  Responding to the UAC with your admin password is a 5-second process; logging into the Admin account takes more time because now all your account settings and start-up apps must load.  Just plain annoying.Okay, so I did that.  The Connect program updated itself without much of a problem, although the updater interface is ridiculously crude: it just says ""wait until download is complete, then click OK"". No progress bar, no estimated time remaining.  It's 2013 and Leapfrog's software guys write crap like this???Then I connected the new LeapReader to the updated Leapfrog Connect program via USB -- funny that my reviewer's sheet warns against the reviewr connecting the LeapReader to the computer at all, or the ""included"" contents would be erased.  Whoever works in Leapfrog marketing should...  Ok, whatever.Indeed, connecting my shiny new LeapReader to Leapfrog Connect deleted the dinosaur book's audio content. Once I logged into my Leapfrog account, I was given a couple of free audio samples, including, finally, the sample file for the included sample book.  Scratching my head in disbelief... Who the heck came up with this great product??According to Leapfrog Connect, the LeapReader has a meager 201 MB of memory.  The sample book's audio file is 9MB. The dinosaur book's audio file (which I later downloaded) is 8MB.  The Mr. Pencil book is 11MB.  Let's say the average book's audio file is 10MB in size. That comes to up to 20 books you can store on the LeapReader.  Its 2013 and LeapFrog's hardware guys make crap like this???  That's at most 20 books without any other content!Actually I got ahead of myself a little.  When I was trying to download the dinosaur and Mr. Pencil books' contents, I ran into problems with the lovely Leapfrog Connect program.  Just as it happened before, this updated version (albeit looking better than before) kept trying to download or sync, or both, the audio file(s) to the LeapReader.  I was disconcerted by the countless disconnect/connect happenings that were taking place between the LeapReader and the Leapfrog Connect program.  I thought the infamous bug, whereby Leapfrog Connect was never able to download any content to your expensive toy, was going to bite again.  Out of experience, I decided to leave the syncing alone and went to get lunch for my kids.  When I came back, the books synced.  Later, I synced the U.S. map audio file and that appears to have synced fine.  (I haven't been able to check the map audio since my kids appear to have misplaced the Tag map!)Now, if you have a Tag, you may be wondering whether the LeapReader is compatible with Tag books.  Judging from the ""Companion Audio"" download screen, it seems that only some Tag books are compatible with the LeapReader. For example, ourLeapfrog Tag Activity Storybook Kung Fu Panda: Po's Tasty Trainingis NOT on the list, therefore we'll not be able to re-enjoy that small book with the LeapReader.  Only a few Tag books like I Spy Imagine That! and Spy Wars the Clone Wars are on the downloadable companion audio list.  This sucks, period.  We have a dozen Tag books that we bought.  I thought at least my baby is now old enough to read them, but with the three Tag Readers misplaced (with one probably conveniently ""borrowed"" without permission by one of the neighborhood boys who's known to take to, at the ripe age of 8, borrowing other people's toys without asking and displaying them in his bedroom), we now cannot rely on LeapReader to read these books. Just sucks, like I said.In summary, I'm once again disappointed by a LeapFrog product.  All they have to do is invest a few dollars and get a working syncing program before releasing these hardware products.  Better yet, they should make these things wireless capable, so that all us parents have to do is download content on the fly, without having to find the PC to connect to.  Seriously, there're so many ways to improve this product.  Sadly, the same was said by me and others 3 or 4 years ago when we first bought into Leapfrog's ""non-smart"" educational toys."

Reviews:
My son actually learned to read with the help of the original Tag reader.  The ability for him to explore on his own at times, sounding out words and having the pen to help when he got stuck, helped a lot.  We were excited to get the LeapReader, as my daughter is now learning to read.  In many ways, it's the same as the Tag reader.  Kids can still use it to read along to stories, and can have it either read the whole book or just provide extra help when they don't know a word.  You can also set it to game or trivia mode to add an extra level to the books.That being said, there have been some changes.  I love that you can use this pen to help write now as well, which was something Tag did not do.  We have used Mr. Pencil with the leap pad, but it's even better to be able to use a kind of paper on a flat surface to simulate school writing.  The LeapReader holds more books than our original Tag, which is also great, but I don't understand why the new download method is so different - we've had to re-download books several times when we add new titles.  Battery life is great.  Many of our Tag books were compatible, and I'm hoping the remainder will be added soon.All in all, I really like the new reader system.  Apart from the downloading issues, it's a great improvement from the original Tag, and still a really neat tool for early readers.
"The LeapReader/Tag system is one with which our family is very familiar. My nine-year-old daughter used the original Tag reader, and my four-year-old son has a Tag Junior. I like the Tag system and have bought multiple complementary products. How much use yours will get really depends on your child and whether or not they're enthralled by the system.The system I received is a bit of a special case in that it came preloaded with a variety of content. However, if you're buying the system, you will need to charge the pen for at least an hour, and you'll need to set up the software, download any books or other media you want to put on it, etc. In other words, if you buy this for your child, don't let them know you have it until you have everything set up and ready to go so that they can begin playing with it immediately.Improvements:- Multiple modes: As with the old system, there's the regular book mode, where kids can follow along in a book while listening to the story, playing games, etc., but the new LeapReader also includes an audiobook mode, a trivia mode, and a music mode. I was quite impressed with the old system, and I like that this revamp adds more versatility to what was already a nice product.- Writing feature: This is a pretty cool addition. The point on the LeapReader doesn't draw on anything other than the special paper, so you don't need to worry about pencil marks all over the house, but it could scratch furniture and such.Criticism:- I was very put off by the ""sampler"" book because, in essence, it's nothing more than an advertisement for companion products. The book is chock full of two-page spreads from a variety of other LeapReader books, practically guaranteeing a response of, ""I want this book!"" from your child. I didn't even bother giving it to my son. Even the regular books have ads at the back for additional products, and I have no doubt this was a deliberate move on the part of the company.When we first got the LeapReader, my son played with it nonstop for an entire day, and then things went seriously downhill once I had to charge it. I like that I don't need to hunt down batteries for the LeapReader like I did with the Tag Junior and the old Tag, but the downside is that having to charge it means taking the LeapReader away for as long as it takes to charge, while the old Tag could keep going once new batteries were inserted.The big downside to the pencil system is that the paper is a one-shot deal. I can understand this as it's a way for parents to see what their child's writing looks like, but if your child scribbles on the paper as my son did on a few of the sheets, you're out those pieces of paper and have to buy more. This made me glad I put the extra sheets away without my son seeing them. The writing aspect is probably most advantageous if a parent works with the child, but it does take away from the independence, which is one of the best things about the LeapReader/Tag systems.My son really likes the audiobook mode and will often put it on when he's playing with other toys, which I thought was nice. He enjoys the songs too, and will sometimes put these on as well, when he's engaged in other play. He likes to have music while he's playing, and it's nice that he can provide it for himself when he's in the mood.I was pleased to see that most of the products we already owned for my daughter's old reader were compatible with this new one, though the Tag Super Speller board we bought for her isn't, so we have to break out the old Tag when my son wants to play with the board. It doesn't make much sense to me why I couldn't download the audio for this product for the new system. Otherwise, installation of the books that were still compatible wasn't a problem. All it took was plugging the LeapReader in, navigating to the appropriate book in the LeapReader Connect app, and downloading the appropriate audio, all of which took no longer than ten to fifteen minutes.All in all, I liked what they've done with the new system, and this is a welcome addition to the LeapFrog products we already own."
My daughter can't put this thing down.  She already loves books, but the interactive nature of the pen and books has her hooked.  Some of the features I observed:+ Battery life: We've had no issues yet.  We tend to charge it via USB every night just to be safe.+ Writing exercises: a little early for my little one, but she likes that it's fun and encouraging.  We're working on those activities together.+ Book Quality: The books are written in a way to encourage language skill development.  They also include games, trivia, and automatic narration.  She's already really getting the hang of dragging the pen along the paragraphs from left to right.  So cool to watch the light slowly turn on in her mind.+ Extra Books: This has the capacity to grow as your child learns, expanding the library and options for reading/writing.  The options are pretty broad and cover an age range from about 4-8.  I wish the books were more affordable but sometimes you can find them on closeout.  Of course MY daughter is obsessed with princesses so we've already acquired the Cinderalla, Tangled, Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast Books.  Overall, the LeapReader is much more versatile than the Tag Jr that is collecting dust on our shelf.+ Storage Space: Unlike the Tag Jr. which could only handle about 7 books at a time, we've loaded a ton of stuff onto the leapreader and still have room to spare.  Score.- Compatibility w/ Tag Jr: I do wish they were compatible.  It's pretty expensive to invest in two systems; one for toddler and one for pre-K through early primary.- Extra Features: It comes pre-loaded with audiobooks and songs, but if you want more, it's pretty pricey to buy them.  They should be free, IMO.- Default volume: It's pretty loud on default.  Wish it were lower.  Even if I remember to adjust it down before handing it to my little one, if she sets it down for 5 minutes and it goes to sleep, the volume resets to loud.  This is a minor irritant.
It's advertised for the four to eight year old group.  Our daughter just turned seven, and this is a little too simple for her.  It would be fantastic for someone needing help with practicing how to write their letters and numbers.  If you already know how to do it, it's too simple.  She played with it about five minutes and was done.  Also, when it reads a story, it just begins reading the page, doesn't highlight individual words or anything, so I don't see how it would be helpful in learning to read.  It reads so quickly that I don't think my daughter could keep up with where the words were on the page.  I think for age three to five, it would be perfect.  It was simple to set up.  Instead of batteries, it has an included USB, but you must attach it to your computer to update and charge.  There is a separate adapter you can purchase that the USB could plug into and then plug into an outlet.  The software installation was simple and it's easy for a young child to use, intuitive.  I think it's perfectly fine, just not for the older children who have already mastered writing.  We don't have any of the other books, maybe that would make it more interesting for our daughter.
"We really enjoyed this writing system and used it with the Dinosaur book. It was fun for the kids and they got an opportunity to learn about some dinosaurs they hadn't heard about before, which is really neat. One limitation was that the choices in the games got to be a bit limited, so when you have more than one child playing together (we have 3) it can get redundant pretty quickly. Of course, the way to avoid this is to buy a lot of different books for the system, but that could gent up getting quite pricey.I would recommend for the 4 - 6 crowd with the understanding that each book may not get a lot of replay, especially if many children are playing with it together. The kids and I really enjoyed it the first few days and they asked to play with it often. However, since we didn't purchase a lot of other books they tended to lose interest. One reason we didn't purchase additional books is because my kids aren't in to many of the ""mass market"" children's books. If your kids are big fans of Disney characters, there will be no end to the amount of books you can add to your collection while they are still in the best age range for the product."
My younger kids had fun with this, though my five year old got bored after a while.  It can be an investment because while there are lots of books they aren't free obviously.  Still the prices aren't bad, and if it encourages a reluctant reader then it's easily worth the price.  I wouldn't have seen the value when I just had one kid, when I had plenty of time to sit and read with him.  That kind of 1:1 time is way more valuable on many levels.  However as our family has grown that kind of focused time has to be rationed out a bit, having this around to help with the reading hasn't been be a bad thing.  It's pretty easy to use, and the kids seem to enjoy it.  If your kid is naturally motivated to read and write, I'm not sure I'd add yet another electronic device into their overly programmed lives.  However some kids don't gravitate that easily to reading, and in that case this can really help.  And if it helps an overloaded family, well then all the better.
This is the second LeapReader I've gotten, mostly because each of my two kids wants to use it at the same time, which tells you everything you need to know about how it appeals to youngsters.There are really two ways you can use this: in a more guided way, where parents work with their kids, which is what I think you'll have to do for all but the most mature kids with the writing elements, and as an educational entertainment device. The audio books have proven to be very popular in our house, filling in during car trips that aren't long enough to bring the iPad for movies but are long enough to try a five year-old's patience.In general the system is good. I will say that the books can be more durable. My two year-old shredded the sampler book over the course of two weeks, mostly by being so excited by the book that she stood on the pages.My kids really like these. Getting the most out of the educational elements requires a commitment from the parent to make this more of a learning tool and less of a toy, but there is so much you can do with these, it's really worth it. Big favorite in my house.
I received this in time for my granddaughter's 7th birthday. After rethinking it, I wondered if she was going to be bored by this toy. She is a very high reading first grader.No problem! She LOVES it! The occasional word she couldn't sound out was quickly correctly spoken by the pen. She was somewhat frustrated by the sampler book, because there is only one page from each story and she wanted to know how the stories ended!She shared it with her 5 yr old non-reading cousin, and he, too, played with it for hours.She in enthralled with the music. The learning songs are very catchy and teach reading concepts rapidly and easily.My favorite part is that the pen is rechargeable! Fast and easy to get back to playing!
i was very disappointed to see my package was missing the reading pen!  the book and the handwriting practice sheets looked wonderful, unfortunately my 5yo could not use the system without the pen.UPDATE: the manufacturer sent me a replacement so i could review this item, and i'm so glad they did - this system is fantastic!!  my just-turned 5yo dd knows her basic phonics (e.g., 1st set of bob books), but her letter formation is terrible.  i feel such guilt for not working more with her, but with 2 older kids and a job, it is hard to find the time to sit with her and watch her write.this reading and writing system is awesome.  she expands her vocabulary with the leap reader books, and the system allows her to go back to unfamiliar words to read aloud.  the writing system won't let her go forward unless she begins at the correct starting point and traces over the colored lines.  for those who don't have a tag reader, the tip is not actually a pen, it's a pencil mounted onto a thick holder so it's very easy for small hands to manipulate. the best part is the pen is telling her to go back and do it the right way, so she doesn't get angry with me for correcting her. because the leapreader talks, my daughter can practice her writing on the kitchen counter and i am free to prep dinner while i listen to her progress.another reviewer said the USB charging/uploading was kind of a pain.  i agree, batteries and bluetooth would have been nice.  however, i don't think it's enough of an inconvenience to take a way one star.  i look forward to seeing more of this series. i am thoroughly impressed with how technology has been applied to helping kids read and write, and i am not one who believes things like an ipad can replace mom & dad's attention and guidance.
"To start with, let me say we are a family that owns three Tag Readers, two Tag Juniors, one each of Leapster, Leapster 2 and Leapster Explorer, and at one point we also bought a LeapPad but hated it so much that we returned it after one day.I received this new LeapReader, which is an update to the Tag Reader, for review. In the package I also received two LeapReader books,LeapFrog LeapReader Book: Leap and the Lost Dinosaur (works with Tag)andLeapFrog LeapReader Book: Learn to Write Numbers with Mr. Pencil.A quick overview: the LeapReader adds new functionalities to the Tag Reader, including stand-alone audiobooks and music player. It also comes with a built-in rechargeable battery as opposed to alkalines in the Tag Reader.  In case you have never seen a Tag Reader before, the LeapReader uses an optical recognition system that picks up information on specially printed paper (basically paper with tiny little dotted patterns that tell the LeapReader which book, which page and which ""hot spot"" the tip is scanning, and the on-board little computer can then play the respective content.)The out-of-package experience has been overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer's sheet claims that the two included books in the review kit had been pre-installed. Not true. To my unpleasant surprise, only the dinosaur book was playable out of the box. The Mr. Pencil book was not installed, and, worse, the sample book that's included in every retail package was also not installed!Anyone who's ever used a Leapfrog ""smart"" educational toy before knows how bad their Leapfrog Connect program is. This is the program that you MUST install on a PC in order to download audio content to the LeapReader (much as with the older Tag and Tag Junior). When I read on the packaging that I must use the Leapfrog Connect program again, my heart skipped a beat and my blood pressure went up.  I really hated that program.  (Don't ask me why we kept buying Leapfrog products...)I'm happy to report that the updated Leapfrog Connect program is as buggy as ever.  First of all, like any half-smart computer user, I use a Standard User account 100% of the time (so to shield my system from potential viral attacks).  If you have an older version of LeapFrog Connect installed on your computer,  you must log into the Administrator account in order to update it!  Seriously, Leapfrog.  Any decent Windows program would update under the User Account Control, without the user's having to log into the Admin account separately.  So now I had to log into my Admin account, which I had never had to do once since getting this Lenovo laptop over a year ago.  That was annoying.  Responding to the UAC with your admin password is a 5-second process; logging into the Admin account takes more time because now all your account settings and start-up apps must load.  Just plain annoying.Okay, so I did that.  The Connect program updated itself without much of a problem, although the updater interface is ridiculously crude: it just says ""wait until download is complete, then click OK"". No progress bar, no estimated time remaining.  It's 2013 and Leapfrog's software guys write crap like this???Then I connected the new LeapReader to the updated Leapfrog Connect program via USB -- funny that my reviewer's sheet warns against the reviewr connecting the LeapReader to the computer at all, or the ""included"" contents would be erased.  Whoever works in Leapfrog marketing should...  Ok, whatever.Indeed, connecting my shiny new LeapReader to Leapfrog Connect deleted the dinosaur book's audio content. Once I logged into my Leapfrog account, I was given a couple of free audio samples, including, finally, the sample file for the included sample book.  Scratching my head in disbelief... Who the heck came up with this great product??According to Leapfrog Connect, the LeapReader has a meager 201 MB of memory.  The sample book's audio file is 9MB. The dinosaur book's audio file (which I later downloaded) is 8MB.  The Mr. Pencil book is 11MB.  Let's say the average book's audio file is 10MB in size. That comes to up to 20 books you can store on the LeapReader.  Its 2013 and LeapFrog's hardware guys make crap like this???  That's at most 20 books without any other content!Actually I got ahead of myself a little.  When I was trying to download the dinosaur and Mr. Pencil books' contents, I ran into problems with the lovely Leapfrog Connect program.  Just as it happened before, this updated version (albeit looking better than before) kept trying to download or sync, or both, the audio file(s) to the LeapReader.  I was disconcerted by the countless disconnect/connect happenings that were taking place between the LeapReader and the Leapfrog Connect program.  I thought the infamous bug, whereby Leapfrog Connect was never able to download any content to your expensive toy, was going to bite again.  Out of experience, I decided to leave the syncing alone and went to get lunch for my kids.  When I came back, the books synced.  Later, I synced the U.S. map audio file and that appears to have synced fine.  (I haven't been able to check the map audio since my kids appear to have misplaced the Tag map!)Now, if you have a Tag, you may be wondering whether the LeapReader is compatible with Tag books.  Judging from the ""Companion Audio"" download screen, it seems that only some Tag books are compatible with the LeapReader. For example, ourLeapfrog Tag Activity Storybook Kung Fu Panda: Po's Tasty Trainingis NOT on the list, therefore we'll not be able to re-enjoy that small book with the LeapReader.  Only a few Tag books like I Spy Imagine That! and Spy Wars the Clone Wars are on the downloadable companion audio list.  This sucks, period.  We have a dozen Tag books that we bought.  I thought at least my baby is now old enough to read them, but with the three Tag Readers misplaced (with one probably conveniently ""borrowed"" without permission by one of the neighborhood boys who's known to take to, at the ripe age of 8, borrowing other people's toys without asking and displaying them in his bedroom), we now cannot rely on LeapReader to read these books. Just sucks, like I said.In summary, I'm once again disappointed by a LeapFrog product.  All they have to do is invest a few dollars and get a working syncing program before releasing these hardware products.  Better yet, they should make these things wireless capable, so that all us parents have to do is download content on the fly, without having to find the PC to connect to.  Seriously, there're so many ways to improve this product.  Sadly, the same was said by me and others 3 or 4 years ago when we first bought into Leapfrog's ""non-smart"" educational toys."
My child has had Tag and Tag Jr for a while, and loves both. The new LeapReader seems to be an improvement over Tag reader, and my son loves it much better. His favorite part is music and audio books. The new reader works the same with books as Tag did, but now you can also write with it on special paper, like the Fly pen from a few years back. The Leapreader is thinner then Tag, but it is still way too fat and heavy to be used as a pen by a little child. It is uncomfortable even for me, and my son actually holds it with two hands for writing. Even with his favorite character Mr Pencil, my son does not want to write in the book.Leapreader has more memory, but the books take more space on it then the same books on TagI am really glad that they made it with rechargeable batteries, it is so much more convenient.
My 3-year-old daughter enjoys her LeapReader, but I think she will enjoy it even more over the coming years as she learns more about letters and reading.  The LeapReader helps children learn to write letters by guiding their letter strokes, and this part of the LeapReader is fun even for young children.  The phonics part (sounding out words) is more advanced and is a stepping-stone to learning how to read.  This part will be most enjoyable to children in the 4-5 year range, or even 6 years old.The stories are entertaining but not quite as entertaining for my daughter as when I read out loud to her, so she sometimes loses interest in this part.  Also, as others have mentioned, adding additional books and other features requires buying separate books.  All in all, this is a great product, though it should be used with heavy adult supervision and interaction to get the best effect.
"This is a HUGE improvement over the LeapFrog Tag Reader -- so much more storage room (I just downloaded a ton of books and still have ample room) and it can be charged by hooking the device up to the computer with the included USB cord (which is a standard USB cable, so if you lose it, you probably have the same one for your camera).  I love that you can download songs, audio books, trivia, etc. - in addition to the material for the Tag books (which are incredible!).  The writing aspect is a huge plus too - and fascinating to my baby!  Ok - but as of 6/28/13, these are the only books available for download (although they told me when I called Customer Service that the other titles listed on their website under the ""LeapReader Compatability"" page will be added toward the end of July/early August):- Beauty and the Beast- Cinderella- Tinker Bell (the book and the puzzle book)- Little Mermaid- Tiana's New Dream- Disney Tangled- Finding Nemo- Cars 2: Project Undercover- Disney: Cars Racing Adventures- Monsters University- Toy Story 3: Together Again- Disney Brave- Pals Puzzle Time- Get Ready for Kindergarten (which we love!)- Human Body Discovery Pack- Leap and the Lost Dinosaur- Learn to Write - ABC and 123- Things That Go- Scooby Do- Solary System Adventure Pack- Learn to Read - Book Set 1 - Short Vowels -- and Book Set 2 - Long Vowels - and Set 3 - Consonant Blends - and Set 4 - Advanced Vowels- Interactive Maps(That is of 6/28/13... Also, if you buy on the company's site by 6/30/13 and enter JUNEBABY as the code, it's forty two bucks)The App Center has a ""coming soon"" banner when you try to click on it... so all of that is a little disappointing... but I'm sure it's going to be great and this is definitely a 5 star product."
We have several LeapFrog products (LeapPad2, Tag Jr., and Tag) and have been impressed by all of them.  The LeapReader is similar to LeapFrog's Tag, but adds some new features.  The LeapReader can be used with both LeapReader and (many) Tag products.  The main difference between the LeapReader and Tag is that the LeapReader can be used with LeapFrog's new writing paper.  You are given letters to write out and the LeapReader interacts with the pages as you write.  The pages are pressure-sensitive so writing with the LeapReader (or Tag) will leave a mark.  The LeapReader also has a few extra buttons, mainly handy for playing music (up to 175 songs can be stored at one time).  We have tried a few LeapReader products already with the pen and they are all educational and fun.  My daugther especially likesLeapFrog LeapReader Book: Leap and the Lost Dinosaur (works with Tag).  The age range for the LeapReader is 4-8.  I'd suggest closer to 4-6 years old, but it depends on the kid of course.
PROS: The pen is very portable and has multiple uses. It can be used to read the books, the words, play games, play music and audiobooks and more. My daughter had lots of fun with it. The rechargeable battery lasts for a long time.CONS: The USB cord, used to charge the pen and update it with new books, is way too short. I had to drape the pen on my PC or let it dangle. The special sheets can be used only once. While it doesn't create a mess, it's easily scratched up. You could use a fingernail to write on it. I was especially interested in my daughter learning to make her letters the correct way. She attacks letters like they're art which leads to her doing such things as drawing the line in a Q first before making the circle. But I found from watching my daughter, that if you keep doing it wrong the pen gets confused and gives up on you.
"Love tbe newly designed Reading and Writing system! What a nice enhancement from the Tag system. We love LeapFrog products and are so pleased they have come out with something that really helps to teach and practice writing. The stroke by stroke instructions for the letters is awesome and the mess free paper is perfect for my five year old who was struggling with making legible letters. She gets the system out all by herself to work on her letters and is so proud when she is able to make them look like they should. Leapfrog really makes this boring chore fun. The new ""pen"" is lighter and easier for her to hold and really makes it feel like she is writing on regular paper. I am thrilled with her progress and the Reading and Writing System."
"I picked this with my 4 year old in mind. She is very anxious to read and write like her older brothers.  With this system, she feels like she can do both!  The provided paper is a bit tricky if you're not careful - it's very easy to make marks on that you cannot erase.  It's similar to pressure-receipt paper, so you will want to store it somewhere that will be away from other objects or not stacked under other pages.  It's great because the provided ""pencil"", as far as we call tell, will not mark on any surface other than the paper.  There's no ink, so there's nothing to leave behind if your child leaves it on the carpet!The books are fun and there's more than the story.  You can use the pencil to click other points around the page for more fun facts, information, or story details.  It keeps the story from getting boring, and makes it more interactive, I think.Our daughter just started pre-school and she is now even more fascinated with this toy as she learns more letters and whatnot.  I think this is something she can continue to grow with and get use from!  The upper level books are even entertaining to our oldest who is almost 9.  He enjoys being able to click random parts of the pages for more information (such as the dinosaur book).Overall, I think this is awesome and you're sure to get PLENTY of mileage out of it!"
This product is missing one thing...the ability to hold ALL of the content.  I wish you could download to a USB drive or something and plug into the pen, the book you want to read.  Having said that, the old one only held 10 or 12 books.  That made it a product that we liked, but didn't love. This one says that it holds up to 40  titles.  As it is now, it holds all the compatible titles that we currently have.  Not all are compatible however, and some that will be, are not yet.The other downside with this product is that when you want to download another title, you have to re-download it every time.  It doesn't save them like it used to.  That may not make sense to the new users, and isn't a huge issue due to the larger storage capability, but still mildly annoying.With all of the negatives out of the way, I still would recommend this product.  The battery life is long.  We will go several months before it needs to be changed.  It allows a child who loves books to spend time exploring themselves.  They also offer way more content than they used to. I am glad to see they brought out a new one.  I thought this product was dead when they brought out their last Christmas offerings, and it made me disappointed.  Glad to see I was wrong.One small thing I would say as well, for parents who are buying this as a Christmas gift.  Open the package and get the books downloaded and ready to go before you wrap it up.  It does take some time and considerable effort to get it up and running. It is not a add batteries and go type of item.
The system resembles a large pen or stylus. When you press the buttons on the pen, it sing songs, plays games, and reads along with the LeadReader books and flash cards. The start up set comes with one pen and a sample book that contains pages from a variety of different level books to give you an idea of how it works. The system is very easy to use. The kids at the party needed a little assistance to get started, but once they got the hang of it, even the preschoolers were able to handle the LeapReader independently.When the kids press the pen against the pages of the book or cards, it reads the information to them. The pen will tell the story, all the while teaching the kids phonics and reading skills. You can read straight threw or have more difficult words sounded out. There are also games to play on different pages of the book. The LeaperReader is a system that really makes reading interactive and fun. I like it a lot better then my old system, because its more compact and there are no cartridges to lose. Because its similar to a handheld stylus, there are even activity books that allow children to write and trace their letters. Another great bonus is there are no batteries. You simply plug the system into your computer to charge. The LeadReader is an educational toy that will last for many years. The reading levels progress along with you child and there are books choices well into the grade school age group.The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five is because I feel, given the price, it should come it a full length book and not just a sampler. If you don't buy another book right away when you order it, you won't really be able to use it.***Portion of review from New Age Mama LeapReader Testing Party. Complimentary product received in exchange for an honest review****
My four year old helped me come to my conclusions on the LeapFrog LeapReader, and in our home it has quickly become a favorite. The basic premise is very neat, a pen that reads the stories and includes your child in activities pertaining to the stories. It is fairly easy to load the stories, just use the pen on a page of the story and then hook the pen up your computer on the Leapfrog Connect program (that can be downloaded from their site) and the pen will add the book to it's memory. I have already been shopping both in store and online to see the variety of books that can be purchased to supplement this system. The only concerns I have with this system is the activity pages that seem to be some sort of carbon paper that is essentially a single use item, I prefer the items that come with my children's toys to be multi-use to be more cost effective. I however simply plan to purchase books that do not contain these activity sheets to avoid that whole situation.
I've been meaning to buy the TAG reading system for my son for a while. I just wasn't sure how effective it would be at learning. We just received the LeapFrog LeapReader and we love it! This is such an amazing system. I/we have no prior experience with it, so everything was new. LeapFrog does a good job of making most everything intuitive and easy to set-up. Things do no come ready to use, except the pen was pre-charged. I had to  plug the Reader into my Macbook through a USB (included), and download the LeapFrog Connect program. From there I had to setup an account and download our first book (LeapFrog LeapReader Book: Leap and the Lost Dinosaur (works with Tag). The process was quick and easy. My son stood there and waited. Sometimes I find downloading on a Mac is quicker than a PC, so maybe we had an advantage over previous reviewers who said the set-up was slow. We had the LeapReader working in minutes.This is such a fantastic invention. There's so much to do in one small book. My son can have a book read to him, touch each word with the pen and have just the word read, or he can have a word sounded out. Anywhere in the book my son can press a picture with the pen and listen to all kinds of interactive dialogue or facts. There are even games to play. It's such an interactive invention! My four year old absolutely *LOVES* it.Okay... the pros and cons.Cons:-My son just turned four and he has trouble holding a regular pencil. The LeapReader pen is thick and fat, and more difficult for him to grasp. But he's learning, and I'm sure he'll be able to hold it better with time. On one hand it encourages him to learn to hold a pen. He gets excited when he holds the pen correctly. I'm certain in several years these pens will slim out as technology improves.-In order to select the different options available in the book (Read the Page, Read the Story, Game, Repeat, etc.) a child has to learn what the icons on the bottom of each page means. That takes a bit of time. Even I have to looks back at the legend to know what my son should press. So it's one of those things you, as the parent, will need to help them with, or preselect and hand to them. This isn't a big issue, but it makes it less intuitive. Not sure how you would get around this problem though. Overall I think LeapFrog did a good job with this.-When you buy a book your pen will not automatically recognize it. You will need to tap a page in the book and go to your Mac or PC and plug the pen in and download it. It makes sense to do it this way, but just so you know you cant just buy a book and hand it to your child in the car to start using right away. However, if you know you're going to go to the store and buy a book, you can pre-download it!-For a kid-friendly toy company, you would think LeapFrog would know parents do not like to get destructive removing toys from packages. I needed a knife and ended up throwing away the box.Pros:-Pen is very sturdy and solid. It's easy for my son to turn on and off, and control the volume. It also has an earplug connection.-Books are very bright and colorful.-Your child can work at their own pace.-My son gets so excited to find out what's on each page, and to listen to all the stories and facts. He plays with the LeapReader a couple times a days. We had an old TAG book that I picked up somewhere, because even without the TAG pen you can still read the book as just a regular book... anyway, the old books are not as interactive and creative as the newer ones. The new LeapReader books are filled with lots of interactive things for my son to press and find. The old books just had a couple things and mostly just made simple sounds.I can't really say enough about this system. LeapFrog has done a fantastic job. They seem to be a company that cares about their products. The set we received for review was filled with lots of extras for us to try. I still went online and purchased more books! I wish every child had one because it's a great learning tool.
My kids have had a number of LeapFrog products over the years. They're all fairly well-done. But we decided to stop buying them a few years ago due to LeapFrog's business model. They release a product that supports certain books (for example, prior readers), then release a new model and the old books no longer work. They release all new books that you have to buy again. Frustrating. Why can't I load all of my kids' old books on the new reader? It works the same. It has the room. No reason other than to nickel and dime your customers. So the only LeapFrog products we've gotten are from relatives. They work well, but we won't actually buy any for our kids until they change how they do business. Your mileage may vary.
"We've had theTagset through both daughters, and now that my youngest is approaching 4 we decided to try the new LeapReader.  There are some nice improvements, not the least of which is much larger internal storage and improved battery life (both small but significant victories from consistent parental feedback).  More impressive is the new paper on which kids can practice their letters, which is pretty cool (although the LeapReader is much too bulky and heavy to hold like an actual pen, so penmanship will have to come later).A couple things need a firmware update before I can improve the rating, though.  First, no matter how many times you set the volume control to kid-appropriate levels, when the LeapReader turns off it resets to blaring.  Second, I've never been a fan of the LeapConnect learning library sync software and the latest update did nothing to help that, making what should be a quick and easy process instead lengthy and convoluted.  Third, despite claims of ""most"" Tag books being compatible, our experience was 6 of 11, so just over half - a big disappointment for old faves.If it wasn't being hamstrung by the software, the LeapReader would be a massive improvement over the Tag.  And as soon as Leapfrog upgrades to 2.0 I'll be able to improve my scoring.  For now it's a pretty good product, but a mediocre experience."
We're pretty new to the whole Tag system here in my household, and I actually accidentally ordered this thinking it was age-appropriate for my daughter. While it isn't, seeing as she's shy of two, we are still using it together, and it maintains her interest long enough.We have supplementary books as well, and are using them around bedtime in conjunction with her story time. The pen intrigues her more than the books themselves.
Having used the various Leapfrog learning toys for preschoolers, it is good to find a system to use with the early school years.  The selection of books seems quite large although it would be better if the various Tag books could all be included too.The combination of reading and interactive content was attractive to my almost 6 year old tester.  She spent a lot of time playing various games and using the pen to write on the special paper.  She knows her letters already but still enjoyed writing the letters.  That particular feature would be very important with the children who are entering KG since it teaches the order of strokes to make the various letters.If a child can be turned on to reading, he/she will do better in school and in life.  This system continues the Leapfrog system of helping a child learn with fun and not with boredom.  The little games in the books keep them interesting for all kids and help them learn so many things without realizing it.
LeapFrog LeapReader Reading and Writing System is the new Upgraded version of the very popular Tag Reading system. If you have never tried or owned a Tag Reader system it's basically a touch based sensor system to help you child with word recognition, comprehension and of course reading.The upgraded Leapreader comes with some great new features including the ability to write/trace letters and words, an Audio player for music and Trivia games as well as mini-games within the books themselves.  The Leapreader is also backwards compatible with 150+ tag books and of course Leapfrog have released exclusive books and Writing Workbooks that work only/exclusively with the Leapreader itself.My 6yr old daughter really enjoys using this and it has helped her tremendously with her reading and word comprehension skills. I would definitely recommend this to any parent of a young child whose in the early stages of learning how to read or a reading beginner.
My 3 1/2 year old daughter already has a Tag Jr system, which we have quite a few books for.  I was disappointed to find out that those books are not compatible with the new LeapReader system.  Some of the other Tag books (not the Jr version though) are compatible.  You can check a compatibility list here:  [...]This new LeapReader does have enough memory for about 40 items, which is a definitely plus over our Tag Jr which only has enough memory for a few books at a time.  There is also the writing capability, but my child is not old enough for that yet since she just wants to scribble and draw.  It is rechargeable by plugging it into the USB port of a computer.  There is an AC adapter available for option purchase.  I suspect that I could just plug the USB cord into my Android phone charger though.  I am not positive about that though, so I have not risked it yet.
My kids really love Leapfrog products and this was a real winner in our home! My daughter is 4 and learning to write letters - she loved tracing the letters with the special pen and following instructions to correctly write each letter and number. The writing pen, a new improved Tag Reader pen is way better than the older model (we have 2) - it is a more slender shape (more like a pen) and better audio. It also has more memory so you can load it up with more books, games and now music as well. When using this pen on the special writing paper you have to be careful that you do not use the paper stacked on top of each other otherwise the marks made on the top page transfers through to the pages underneath.This reader also works with all the Leapfrog tag reader books and maps so it is a great investment.
"We saved this to be opened during a recent car trip and the good news is that, even just with the included materials, my son was happily entertained using this device for close to four hours. While he's already a decent reader and has quite good writing skills at age 5, this reenforced his existing skills and made the learning fun enough that he wanted to continue to read, re-read and do all the activities available. The pen's charge, full at the outset (we did the fairly straightforward set-up before leaving home), also held for the entire trip, though it was getting slightly sketchy toward the end. (Or perhaps as he had done things before my son was just going too quickly.)Though we'd never had a LeapFrog system before, there wasn't much of a learning curve. In fact, he was picking the pen up and ""reading"" and ""writing"" with it while I was still trying to give him instructions. (He's an iPad vet.) Occasionally, he'd go too quickly and the bemoan the pen's ""lag"" (trying to find out what page it was on, or activity requested) but otherwise it worked just as described on the included materials (specifically the reading books and writing workbook), with no issues. (We didn't have any other materials to test it with so I can't comment on the backwards compatibility this new version advertises.)At our destination he was happy to help two younger kids, neither of whom is yet reading on their own, learn the system and all told the kids probably spent another hour or two over the weekend, playing with this. Enough so that my friend has put it on her girls wish list for Christmas.I think my son is at the top of the age/skill range for this pen, but he does enjoy it and wants to look at getting some additional books. I think the best point of entry for this system is right about the point kids start preschool, as those are the level of skills this best reenforces. Even just a year ago, when he was first starting to read, this would have been a huge boon.I really do think it's a great educational assist and I like the fact that it's easily portable. The biggest downside is the cost of additional materials. Assembling a decent size library (15-20 books) along with the cost of the initial system starts to equal the cost of an actual tablet, which can grow along with your child and provide educational opportunities far more advanced."
I rated Leapfrog LeapReader Reading and Writing System 5 stars because it is a great children's product. I had purchase the orignal Leapfrog tag reader early this year and then this new product came out a few months later. Initially I was displeased because I had already spent so much money on the tag and now the newer and updated model was released.After receiving LeapReader, I did notice lots more features, story selections and now an added writing system. My son liked it right away and uses it during grocery shopping, long trip rides, or anywhere for extended times.Overall, this is a great product for children but am not certain it is worth so much money when iPad Apps cost a small fraction of the price, which also offers educational entertainment/enrichment.
I let some of my friends's kids use the pen and book.  They really enjoyed it.  I could see this being the perfect thing to occupy young minds during road trips.  I wish I had something like this when I was a child.  Plus, your kids can use a pen without the fear of it leaking all over the place.
My daughter is three and is now learning to write and loves to 'read' books. This is such a great invention, and she has a blast playing with this LeapReader. There's so much to keep her busy. She can learn to read, and even write, mess-free. Because it's easily portable she even takes it with her in the car. Unfortunately it only comes with one downloadable book (big surprise....) so be prepared to shell out more money for additional features. That's the downside to all these things, but they really are impressive and do help, at least for my child. It helps to have an enthusiastic child I guess as well, but I highly recommend this for anyone of this age about to go to school or even already in school.
This is really a great product for kids learning to read and write.  It says that it is good for kids ages 4-8.  I think, though, that it would be most enjoyed by the 4-6 year old group.  It is nice that the kids can learn to write without making a mess, as the kids trace the letters with the stylus.  Kids can also learn to read by moving the stylus over words and Leapfrog has a number of books that are compatible with this toy.  The deluxe activity set Read & Write Series includes special paper on which the letters' lines become dark, as with a pencil, when traced with the stylus.  Pretty neat!  My only question is whether kids learn better with new technology or whether the simple paper and pencil works better.  If you decide to go the technologically advanced write, however, this is really a great product and a wonderful beginning set.
I like that this is similar enough to the earlier Tag Reader that as a parent, it was pretty easy to get set-up and going.  I also like that it is compatible with most of the Tag Books we already have.  Please note - LeapFrog has said that NOT ALL the Tag Books will be compatible with this new Reader/Writer.I love that LeapFrog has made something that allows kids to work on writing.  As a hands-on parent, I think it is still important to be there while they are learning the letter/pen strokes, but once they get the hang of letters, it is nice to let them listen to the pen on their own and let it guide their pen strokes.Is it sad that I'm still amazed at how the pen interacts with the LeapFrog books/paper?  I wish I understood the technology a bit better, because my kids think the books are magic, and I'd rather explain how it is working, but really... I LOVE these tools, so it isn't a big thing.I also love that Leap continues to focus on learning opportunities and not just entertainment, but they DO make it fun to learn.I honestly don't know how long the battery lasts yet, but we haven't had any tears yet over then pen stopping, so battery life seems pretty long.Another plus is that you can easily tell this pen apart from the others due to the bluish section at the top.Leap - this is a great addition to your books and learning tools.
