Top question:
does it need batteries if so what size?
Top review:
Dusty Crophopper RC plane is a cute, fun toy.  After my granddaughter saw the movie, she was so excited about it that I wanted to get her this toy.  When she saw it, she squealed with delight.  Of course she immediately wanted to play with it, but we soon found it was difficult to play with in the house.  It was nighttime when I gave it to her, so she had to wait until the next day to try it outside.  The reason it's hard to play with in the house is that it needs a lot of space in which to turn and roll, and it really doesn't work that well on carpet, even with a low pile.  It works best on a flat, smooth surface like a kitchen floor, but my kitchen and dining room space is too small and the plane just runs into the furniture.  When we took it outside on the driveway, we had much better results.  However, if the plane runs into any obstacle, like a pebble or twig, it will stop and often flip forward to rest on the propeller.My granddaughter got a kick out of using the controls that fit on her hands.  She isn't quite coordinated enough yet to hold a remote and maneuver it, while also looking at the RC vehicle, and with this remote control, she doesn't have to look at the remote.  She just moves her hands.  She does have to press the button on the right controller with her thumb to make it go forward, but she mastered that pretty quickly.My 2.5 year old grandson also likes Dusty.  He can't really use the remote, but it comes with 3 built-in moves and he really enjoys that.  He also likes to pick Dusty up and pretend to make him fly.Don't forget to pick up 4AA and 2AAA batteries before you give this to a child.  It doesn't come with the batteries and they will be very disappointed if they can't use it right away.  It uses up batteries pretty quickly, but it does have an auto shutoff feature that helps with battery life should the child turn it on and then forget about it.If your child is really into Planes, then I recommend this toy.  If they're not into the movie or haven't seen it, then it may not be as much fun, given the difficulties mentioned above.

Questions:
I was wondering what age group this was for?
Will it work on carpet?
does it need batteries if so what size?
Is there any way to buy a replacement controller?  My son bought this from a children's consignment shop with his own money and it only came with one
Can you buy replacement remotes?
why   can't it  fly ?
what size battery does it need
Can two of these planes be used at the same time?  Are they all the same frequency?  Will they conflict with each other?  (I've only seen 27mHz in stores.)
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
...but a four-year-old will love it.I picked this out thinking it would be a fun toy for my seven-month-old to chase while dad or I played with it. Yeah, stupid thinking mom. This caused my seven-month-old to scream in terror it was so loud. We tried it a couple of times to the same response.So in an effort to still see how to play with it, we had some friends with kids come over and they could play with it. The five-year-old thought it was fun for a bit but lost interest. The four-year-old loved it. He thought it was great (our seven-month-old still was scared of it but didn't start screaming if mom or dad was holding her).The toy is loud but has some neat features. If you run into something, it makes a crashing sound (awesome!). It is fairly responsive and entertaining for a four-year-old. There are some neat fine adjustments that you can make when just using the auto function on it.On the whole, probably a very fun toy for a little kid into cars/planes and a home without super small children.
"No problem for my five year old son to commandeer this plane confidently after a short learning phase. There are two ""wings"" in the package, but only one has actually a steering function, the other is just for decoration. I guess the thinking behind this is that the child mimics the movement of the plane while chasing it, and thus steering the plane. Nice concept, but in reality my son just uses the one controller as a ordinary remote. The reaction of the plane to the steering commands is actually quite responsive, and it is fun to drive (not fly! It only drives on the ground ...) this thing around in the house.There is only a simple on/off switch, and in the ""on"" position, the voice of Dusty Crophopper and some annoying background sounds come out of the loudspeaker on top of the plane. You cannot adjust the volume, nor can you switch this function off. The very loud voice and the background noise becomes quite annoying after a short while, also because the voice-loop is not all that long and it becomes repetitive to hear the same phrases over and over again. My hope is that the sound generator in this plane will brake soon (as it did in a similar toy once before ...). Other than that, this driving-only plane is actually a fun toy."
"Well, the title declares it to be a ""radio control plane"" but, of course, you have to investigate further to realize this is a radio control ""grounded-plane.""  It is not a flying toy.  I don't even think it can fall with style...Anyway, it is a great idea where the child wears a controller on the right hand (a left hand ""wing"" is just for fun and does not control the plane) and can motion with his or her body to have Dusty mimic the motion.  It is difficult to truly control Dusty's motions, but it is fun none-the-less.  My son, aged 9, enjoys playing with him.  He has only used him on a hardwood floor, so I'm not sure how well he would perform on carpeting or grassy areas.The propeller actually spins.  My only concern was that, I wonder if a child with longer hair might be able to get their hair wound up in the propeller??  I don't know.  Just a thought.  The propeller doesn't hurt or anything if you grab it (I tried).The voice is a nice addition and certainly adds to the fun.A pet peeve:  They don't put batteries in it!  So, don't forget the AAA's :Duracell AAA Batteries 16-Pack"
"My 5 y.o. grandson loves ""Dusty"". There was only one review when I ordered Dusty so I understood what I was getting lol You might want to read it if you aren't sure.We've seen the ""Dusty"" commercials on Disney channel a couple of times and every time we do the boys get Dusty out again.It appeals to grandson because he can run around the area and the plane will do what he wants or it will do the preprogram ""stunts"". It is a noisy toy besides the plane noise it talks all the time. Grandson can turn off the plane and still run around with the controls. Be ready though it is a very noisy toy but a fun one."
"Disney Planes Wing Control Dusty Crophopper Radio Control Plane is adorable as he was in the movie and my 3 year old grandson is crazy about anything having to do with Dusty Crophopper. This plane does not fly in the air in case you thought it did. Instead, you need a large area like perhaps your deck or backyard driveway where Dusty will follow the movements of the child when he wears the two controllers on his hands. It makes him feel like he is a plane and as he ""flies"" around with his arms out like a plane, so does Dusty. There are some programmed moves that Dusty can do by just touching a button on the controllers. My grandson LOVES that Dusty talks and has different sounds when he is flying around and it is just another aspect that makes it fun for kids I think between 3 and 6. It does require batteries so check you have them on hand as they don't come with it."
I got this as a fun treat for my 9 year old after seeing an ad on the product. What I didn't expect was the way my husband's eyes lit up, too. My 5 and 2 year olds have also enjoyed playing with it. The plane is designed to operate based on the way you move the controls in your hands. So in a sense, you become the controller. It's simpler than learning how to manuever a joystick control and a lot more interactive. It worked great on the tile in our kitchen, okay on the sidewalk. Some of the bumps on the sidewalk were a bit too much for it. It does not fly, but runs along the ground. It also talks nonstop. In little doses, it was fun. Then I'd walk away. All in all, an engaging toy my kids (and husband) are enjoying!
"First off let me emphasize that he does not actually fly off the ground.  He is an airplane that ""flies"" around on the ground (never leaving the ground) with the kid's arms being the controller.  I have never seen anything like this before and it was actually pretty neat to see in real life action.  After putting in the six batteries (yes they are not included either) your child holds the wings in their hands.  By moving their hands (actually just one of the hands has the movement buttons inside) the airplane will mimic the motions.  My 5 year old loves flying his arms around the driveway and basement and watching Dusty Crophopper do the same.  Its a remote control that he can control by moving himself which I think is easier for young kids.  There are also tons of sounds and phrases too and some moves he will do on his own by just touching a button.  I'd say its cute for kids 3-6 years old.  It is a little tricky to get Dusty to go straight and not lean but after practice kids will get the hang of it."
Disney's Plane Wing Control Dusty is a cool and cute toy for a child.  It comes with two hand controls and Dusty himself.  Dusty says commands so you two can 'fly' together.  However Dusty doesn't fly.  He zooms around the room with your kid controlling him using the hand controls.  Overall, it's cool, but don't expect your kids to spend hours playing with this.  It's good for about 20 minutes then it's on to the next toy.
"First, let me say this plane does not fly. It is basically a remote control car that looks like a plane and has a different type of remote. The remote is the wing that gets held in the right hand. It has a button on it to make Dusty go and the angle at which it is held controls the direction of Dusty and how he turns. Turns is easy, getting Dusty to level out is a little more difficult. The left hand wing does nothing. It is more for play and making your child feel like he/she has two wings.Dusty himself has three built in motions which seem more for demo purposes than anything, They just make him go by himself. I don't see the real point to it.The plane requires 4 AA batteries and the remote 2 AAA batteries. The batteries are not included. It would have been nice to at least include the cheap no name batteries.For a child this is a lot of fun. It was an immediate hit. While it is hard to straighten Dusty out it is not so hard that the fun is ruined.Overall, this is a fun remote control ""car/plane."" I suspect it will be like any remote control car. It gets a lot of play at first but after the novelty wheres off it stays on the shelf and gets pulled out every now and then.If I could give this 3.5 stars I would, but since I can't I'm going with the fun factor and upping it to 4."
"My son is five.  He loves Disney movies and their characters.  He loves Lightening McQueen from Cars.  And let's face it, Planes is pretty much the same thing with...eh, planes.  Naturally, my son took a liking to the movie and Dusty and he was quite excited to add him to his collection of Disney characters.  Dusty is a remote control plane, but not like a remote control car.  Your child places the wing controllers on his hand and pretends that he is the plane.  Simple enough.  Yes, some surfaces are easier than others.  Yes, controlling the plane isn't perfect.  Yes, it takes a good amount of batteries.  But, my son is 5.  He doesn't care about that.  One of his favorite Disney characters has ""come to life"" and he is in control of it.  It doesn't have to be perfect."
My 3 year old really enjoys this toy. He plays with it a lot, although not correctly. He enjoys the voice and the action of the plane. The voice on the plane is very loud and not adjustable so I placed some tape over the speaker and that decreased the sound by about half making it better for everyone. The controller is one of the hand held wings, the other wing is just for show. To make the plane move forward you have to push a button on the hand held wing with your thumb and then tilt the direction you want the plane to move in. I got really frustrated trying to do it and so did my husband. My son, couldn't do it at all. You need a lot of space to get this going but it works well outside so that is a good place to start. My son likes to carry the plane around by its antenna, and so far it has not broken which tells me how durable this toy is.Overall I think this toy would have been much more fun with a standard rc controller that was easier for kids, and grown adults to operate.
We gave this toy to our grandson as a birthday gift, and he was thrilled with it the moment he saw it !  It comes in a colorful, large box, is easy to follow the instructions provided.  He began playing with it immediately, bypassing a number of other toys he received.  He took it outside and was able to follow the instructions by himself.  It's a very impressive item with a Radio Control Plane with wing controls.  I don't know how long the item will last, but he certainly is having a good time with it, as long as it will hold up !  At least for now, he's having a lot fun with it !!
THis is a unique RC plane that instead of a controller it comes with controls that fit in each hand and you get to stick your arms out and zoom around like an airplane.  MY boys really like this especially the youngest as he likes the Planes characters and zooming like an airplane.  The plane works pretty well for this type of design and you must have a pretty good size area to fully enjoy the plane(outside on pavement works best).  The voice sounds just like the character from the movie.  Overall a decent RC vehicle with a twist on controlling.  JUst to note that this is a plane but it does not fly in anyway which is kind of silly.  It is basically just a car that is shaped like an airplane that drives around.
"My 6 yr old son was excited when this came.  We went to see the movie and he loved it so seeing this toy was ""the icing on the cake"".  He was disappointed that it doesn't fly but since he's a car fanatic I thought that would be alright.  It's an adorable plane, we love that it talks and says funny things!  He had a bit of a hard time adjusting to how you steer it (so did I!!), you have to move your body or at least move the controller's position with your hand.  When you tilt it to one direction the plane will turn in that direction."
We were so excited when we ordered this plane because what little boy doesn't love remote controls and airplanes. The design seemed rather ingenious--the child puts little wings on his hands, and extends his arms to remotely control the airplane. Sounds simple enough, looks simple enough, and even a toddler could do it, right? Uh, not so fast.First, the plane doesn't actually fly. Sure, it tells you this on the box, but only in a print that is pretty darned tiny relative to everything else on the box. But the remote has to be easy enough to use, right? Well, in theory, if you've got about an acre of pure, open space for your child to play in, this controller could work great. But in the backyard of my track home? Not so much. In my house? Not at all. The plane moves both too fast and in too big an arc to allow a kid to really control it. It seems like my son could barely get it moving before the plane would hit a wall or end up under the sofa. At first, I thought it was because he's just shy of two and still lacking in hand-eye-coordination. But then I tried it. And my 7 year old tried it. And my husband tried it. And none of us were especially successful at getting this plane to go in a straight line much less navigate through the house.All this wouldn't be so bad if we could just ignore the remote and play with the plane itself. But when we took the batteries out of the remote and just left them in the plane, it quit producing sound.The look of the plane is really cute, but this just isn't a practical toy for kids of any age.
The little ones loved this toy. I would say the age range needs to be dropped to 3 years to 6 years. The sound effects are great and after a little practice the remote works well. Matches up really well with the movie. We are thrilled to add Dusty to our collection of Disney toys. I am sure he will soon be joined by more. These toys are well made and built to last and I appreciate that.
My toddler son who is not 3 yet saw Planes in theatre and was very happy to see Dusty at home. It was instant hit and he still enjoys the toy 3 weeks later. He plays with Dusty on the low carpet and has lots of fun control it. Older kids would have more fun and they are better at steering.Th plane is a bit noisy but not excessively so. The wheels are smooth and it's also easy to push it on the coffee table with on off button. The toys are being abused by my son, he loves to throw stuff and I'm surprised that Dusty looks like new. Good quality toy and definitely fun.I assume it would fly but I'm happy is not, as probably my kid would destroy half of the house;)
This toy appears well made and the character is one that promises to be as well like as Lightening McQueen once the movie makes its rounds.  My grandson, 4 1/2, was very excited when he saw it and waited impatiently as dad installed the 6 batteries required to operate it. (4 go in the plane, and 2 go in the controller. )  Dad also liked the cool interface.  The plane rolls around on the ground and the child controls it by wearing two wing shaped handles on their hands.  To steer you tip your hands with your arms outstretched like an airplanes wings.  A very cool idea and one that kept the kids occupied for about 30 minutes as they got used to the idea and practiced putting Dusty through his paces.  But then they lost interest.  Dusty talks, and he has some preprogrammed moves that you activate by pressing on the top of the cockpit, but in the end, he just rolls along on the floor turning in the direction your arms tip.  A fun idea for toddlers but eventually boring for a little older child.  Since you have to keep your arms outstretched, you need some room to &#34;drive&#34; this, also, racing isnt really an option either. There are sure to be a few kids who will like this, but overall it just doesn't deliver as much bang for the buck as I want out of a gift.
This is a fun toy for toddlers. Some reviewers have complained about it being a plane toy that doesn't fly...well, if you bothered to read the reviews and understand what you're purchasing before you actually buy it, that shouldn't be a problem. This Dusty Crophopper plane talks and moves along with your child as he/she controls the motions with their body. The toy has a bunch of sound effects and speaks a variety of different phrases. There are different motions as well. I agree that it's kind of loud, which gets annoying after a while, but isn't that the case with a bunch of toys that kids love the most? ;) Bottom line, I think most toddlers (ages 3 - 5) will get of of playing with this.
"When I ordered this remote control plane, I knew it was essentially a remote control car shaped like a plane.  In other words, I knew it didn't actually fly.  My husband used to buy the Styrofoam Air Hogs for his own use, and because of this, I realized a remote control airplane that actually flew would probably be cost prohibitive for this age group (3 +).  What I didn't realize is that the child operates the remote controlled ""plane"" with a flight controller shaped like wing, and there's another wing, so he can hold onto one with each hand while spreading his arms.  This is AWESOME!!!  My son already loves to pretend to be an airplane by holding out his arms; now he can pretend while controlling his own little plane on the ground.  I love this, and he does too!  It is a little bit hard and sometimes frustrating for my not-quite-four-year-old to try to control, and it does require both AA (4) and AAA (2) batteries, but all in all, it's a cute, fun toy."
So when I saw this I thought it was a remote control plane that actually flew.  However it does not,  it's more like a remote control car.There are two controllers but only one actually does anything.  They look low plane wings so your kid can hold one with each plane and pretend to fly.  In theory the plane will fly life you do.  It can be hard to level it out,  but not so hard that no one will play with it.My kids actually have a lot of remote control cars and they are fun for a while. Usually they get put in the root box and come out every now and again.  They only have one remote control helicopter and it gets constantly played with to the point of being fought over.  I thought this would be a great addition but again this toy doesn't fly.Its actually a fun  toy and is popular with the younger kids that have tried it in this house (suggested age is 3 +).One more thing, it doesn't come with batteries so make sure to pick some up.
"I have to say this is a must have for any Disney planes fan! Both my son's ages 5 and 8 are going crazy over dusty's phrases and sounds especially the ones that relate to the movie about racing and telling Ripslinger to ""get out of his way"". The controls are simple to use. just put on a ""wing"" on each hand. Only the side that uses 2 AAA batteries (not included) is actually read by the unit, but it makes the whole experience of flying Dusty that much more thrilling to the kids. Dusty himself. needs 4 AA batteries, again not included, and has an on off switch. The unit picks up the remote control from the ""wing"" and depending on which way you want the plane to go, is how you hold your arms. both straight out for straight, and pitched for left/right depending which arm is in the highest position. There is a small button on the wing remote to tell the plane to go forward. We absolutely love Dusty and recommend it for ages 4 and above."
Dusty Crophopper RC plane is a cute, fun toy.  After my granddaughter saw the movie, she was so excited about it that I wanted to get her this toy.  When she saw it, she squealed with delight.  Of course she immediately wanted to play with it, but we soon found it was difficult to play with in the house.  It was nighttime when I gave it to her, so she had to wait until the next day to try it outside.  The reason it's hard to play with in the house is that it needs a lot of space in which to turn and roll, and it really doesn't work that well on carpet, even with a low pile.  It works best on a flat, smooth surface like a kitchen floor, but my kitchen and dining room space is too small and the plane just runs into the furniture.  When we took it outside on the driveway, we had much better results.  However, if the plane runs into any obstacle, like a pebble or twig, it will stop and often flip forward to rest on the propeller.My granddaughter got a kick out of using the controls that fit on her hands.  She isn't quite coordinated enough yet to hold a remote and maneuver it, while also looking at the RC vehicle, and with this remote control, she doesn't have to look at the remote.  She just moves her hands.  She does have to press the button on the right controller with her thumb to make it go forward, but she mastered that pretty quickly.My 2.5 year old grandson also likes Dusty.  He can't really use the remote, but it comes with 3 built-in moves and he really enjoys that.  He also likes to pick Dusty up and pretend to make him fly.Don't forget to pick up 4AA and 2AAA batteries before you give this to a child.  It doesn't come with the batteries and they will be very disappointed if they can't use it right away.  It uses up batteries pretty quickly, but it does have an auto shutoff feature that helps with battery life should the child turn it on and then forget about it.If your child is really into Planes, then I recommend this toy.  If they're not into the movie or haven't seen it, then it may not be as much fun, given the difficulties mentioned above.
"I have a 10 year old girl and a 7 year old boy. They both love playing with Dusty Crophopper. Their favorite aspect of the toy is the remote that fits over the hand. The child pretends to be a plane while playing with Dusty. This allows Dusty to be a playmate, not just an RC toy.The voice of the toy is clear and accurate to the film. It isn't overly loud but is loud enough for the child to hear during active play. And this is a toy that you can't sit down and play as an RC toy (but a child can pick Dusty up and fly him around).Dusty does go on medium-height carpet but not very well. On hardwood it runs so smoothly, you'd expect him to take off.A great toy. The kids rated it ""two wings up."""
