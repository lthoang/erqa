My 4-year-old granddaughter absolutely loves this set. She finds immense humor in feeding the dogs treats, then cleaning up the resulting poop with the scooper. Not only is it a fun toy, but it also teaches about being responsible with your pet.The dog is quite large in comparison to the doll; more like a mini pony than a dog. But my granddaughter doesn't care or even notice that the size ratio isn't right. There are, of course, lots of little pieces so this is definitely not recommended for younger children or even those who seem old enough but still like to put things in their mouths.Overall, this is a huge hit and a favorite among my granddaughter's budding Barbie collection.

Reviews:
My daughter loves Barbie dolls and dogs.  So for us, this set was a must-have.  That said, if you hate toys that have lots of tiny pieces, don't go near this thing.  The doll itself is your basic pink-box Barbie doll with no jewelry.  The &#34;star&#34; of this set is the dog and its various accessories.  The whole point is to feed the dog tiny little dog bones and then push its tail so it deposits out bits of poo about the size of a Tic-Tac.  Having enjoyed this for about a week, I think we've now lost all but one of the nearly microscopic dog bones, and we're (perhaps thankfully) down to a single bit of poo.Then there&#8217;s a box to store the bones, a &#34;scooper&#34; to pick up the dung, and a trash can.  In other words, there are a lot of small and smaller pieces in this set.  It's a certainty - you will lose some of these tiny pieces, possibly within a few minutes of opening the box.  Overall, I was disappointed with the dog figure.  Our dog's mouth very often gets stuck in the open position, giving it an odd and somewhat creepy facial expression (especially as it ejects its poo).  You have to really push the head down in order for it to close back up and look normal again, but that's an annoyance, especially since my daughter comes to me for help every few minutes.  It's worth noting that after a week or so, my daughter has pretty much set this one aside in favor of some of her other, older Barbie sets.
My daughter was amused by the concept of this doll. A dog that poops! Hah! And since she's watched the Life in the Dreamhouse series on Netflix, she was primed to want it.The build quality is standard with other Barbie products, no complaints there. My issue is that there's all these fiddley little bits to deal with: individual treats and individual dog poop (yes, actual Barbie dog poop). I think it took her all of two days to more or less loose all the dog treats and dog poop, and I think she got bored with that trick anyway. So I'm sure part of the price of the doll is wrapped up in these tiny, easy to lose things.
Yes...Barbie now owns and uses her very own pooper scooper for her beloved dog Taffy, lol.  It is amazing what products are released on the market these days.  I do have to admit that this set is cute and well made.  Taffy is made of a smooth plastic ( which makes it easy to play with in the bathtub or pool as well) and the entire eating and pooping process seems to work fairly well.  Simply feed Taffy her bone-shaped treats, push down her tail and watch as she poops.  Barbie can then use the pooper scooper to pick up the poop and put in the included trashcan.  When not in play, the treats can also be stored in a handy little compartment in the bag that Taffy wears.  All in all, a cute and fun set that is sure to bring lots of giggles and play as your Barbie lover helps Barbie take Taffy for a walk.  The food bowl and leash that clips on to Taffy and actually fits well in Barbie's hand is a great extra!  I would recommend this fun and cute set to anyone who enjoys Barbies, as well as dogs.
I think the subject line here kind of says it all right?  I mean you put the plastic poop in Taffy, pull her tail and out comes the poop.  Kinda gross, yeah?  Of course pretty much every child is going to love it.I'm not really sure why this has to be a Barbie &#34;thing&#34;, but I guess teaching your little ones the importance of cleaning up after their pets is good.My daughter is just about to turn four, btw.  She has gotten very into Barbies and action figures, so she enjoyed the heck out of this Barbie as much as any of her other ones.  And even when she lost interest in making the dog poop, Taffy was still a nice addition to the various games she puts together in her dollhouse.
My 4-year-old granddaughter absolutely loves this set. She finds immense humor in feeding the dogs treats, then cleaning up the resulting poop with the scooper. Not only is it a fun toy, but it also teaches about being responsible with your pet.The dog is quite large in comparison to the doll; more like a mini pony than a dog. But my granddaughter doesn't care or even notice that the size ratio isn't right. There are, of course, lots of little pieces so this is definitely not recommended for younger children or even those who seem old enough but still like to put things in their mouths.Overall, this is a huge hit and a favorite among my granddaughter's budding Barbie collection.
"When I was kid, back around the end of the Stone Age, we didn't play with toys that pooped. Somehow, the whole idea wouldn't have been appealing, know what I mean? Nowadays, there are dolls that eat at one end and - evacuate - at the other, and now Barbie has joined the parade with her pet pooch pooper.When my 4-year-old granddaughter saw the ad for this doll set on TV, she thought it looked like about the best thing since sliced bread. I was completely puzzled by that, and asked her why she liked it. Of course, being four, the munchkin couldn't really give me a reason that made much sense to me. But then, I also don't understand why people are so enamored of posting all their personal thoughts and data and activities on Facebook for everyone in the world to see, either. I mean, do you really think that ANYONE cares if you think the sushi on the plate in front of you is ""YUMMMMMMMY!!!!!"", so much so that we need to see a picture of it, like, RIGHT NOW?Also, I have to think there are a lot of toy designers running around nowadays who must have had potty-training issues when they were kids. A lot of scatological obsession out there, what with all the pooping toys on the market.ANYway...When the toy arrived and she saw the box, her eyes grew as wide as saucers, and she couldn't wait to get her hands on it. She was completely occupied with feeding and ""relieving"" it, and it's a Barbie. Yippee!Build quality is as we've come to expect from Mattel: excellent. Judging by my munchkin it has high playability, and ""fun factor"".The one thing you really, really need to keep in mind: the dog biscuit ""food"" pieces and the little ""poop"" pieces are just that: little. You're going to want to restrict the play area to a table top or something, because even in the first half hour she was playing with it here we had to search for missing pieces several times. Those teeny plastic pieces BOUNCE. I was crawling all over the floor looking for them, and a couple of times they'd bounced under the couch.Good value for the money, in line with the overall Barbie line. Solid four stars."
My daughter is in first grade, and loves taking care of animals. This set was a natural fit for her.In the box, you get:Taffy the dog - She has a pink backpack (all one piece molded on to the dog) that holds the poop pellets on one side, and the dog treats on the other side.Barbie - Dressed in a casual dog-walking outfit. She comes with a tunic top, pink leggings, and blue wedge sandals.Garbage pailPooper ScooperDog bowlDog TreatsPoop PelletsSmall case for storing treats or pelletsLeash for TaffyIf you are getting a puppy in your household, this would be a cute set for you to demonstrate training techniques to your young children. You can use this set to model correct and incorrect behaviors with your (real) dog.My daughter just had fun playing with it!
Wow! My daughter loves this toy. The dog actually eats bones and it goes inside. A button has to be pressed to release them for further consumption. The dog also has poop. It is dropped into the dog and the tail is then lifted up. The poop will come out one by one at each pump. The scoop can then be used to clean it up. Whoever came up with this doll and dog are creative! The only caution I would give is that the poop and bones are easy to lose due to being small. So, be careful. If it is lost, it is lost!
I'm not really sure what was going through the Barbie folks that they thought a pooping puppy was a great, hot selling idea, but it actually works for my six and nine year old daughters.  Although it seemed kind of gross to me, my daughters loved giving the little doggy some treats, then taking it for a walk, having him do his business, and then cleaning up after.  Maybe because we have a dog at home that they need to cleanup after, but it was actually fun/funny for them.The only negative on this toy, and it is a pretty important one, was that there are ALOT of small pieces.  Everything from the doggy treats to the poo, to the dog bowl is small, but then it seems like this is the way toys are going nowadays.  My daughters both have several Lollaloopsy dolls and this toys are FILLED with small parts - all wonderfully suited to either be eaten by the dog or vacuumed up by mom.Because of the big negative of all the small pieces and the somewhat questionable &#34;fun&#34; of the toy, I gave it three stars.  My girls liked playing with it, but I'm not sure every kid would.
As others have mentioned, there are a ton of little pieces which get lost very quickly.  We used perler beads for poop once the poop started getting lost.  The rest of the pieces aren't as fun for them - such as the pink poop picker-upper which requires quite a lot of dexterity.  We also had an issue involving the pieces getting stuck and I had to find a coat hanger to fix it.The dog is cute though and my kids thought the pooping was hilarious.  Obviously if you're not okay with potty humor you shouldn't buy this.  Having said that, once the pieces are quickly lost, it's pretty much just Barbie with a dog anyway.
I have to admit, I'm not all that keen on the whole pooping toy craze... I'm all about roll playing for children, and appreciate that they might want to mimic things they see Mom or Dad doing and that helping with pet care as they grow is an important step in that... but I'm thinking more along the lines of pour some food or water in the dogs bowl or brush the kitty... not scoop the poop. That said  my 4yr old daughter wanted this the min. she saw it and after receiving it and playing with it with her I'm happy with the toy.The doll is well made, her clothing is cute and appropriate. These aren't the Barbie's of my generation who could only sit with their legs straight out or stand, her knees bend and she can sit/stand etc. The real star of the show though is of course her dog. I'm really glad that Mattel opted to design the toy so that the food and poop were two separate things. I love how the dog appears to actually eat the treats (they collect in the backpack it wears) and you put the little poops in the other side of the pack and then the dog &#34;gos&#34; when you press down on it's tail. This is far more appealing than a competetors toy which you actually feed the pet the poop &#34;I poop rainbows, I poop jewels, I poop glitter&#34; have you seen those commercials? I assure you that neither Fido nor Fluffy are pooping rainbow glittered jewels and at least Barbie here is semi realistic.All in all a nice toy. The dog bones and little poops are CRAZY tiny as you would imagine so this is something I insist my daughter plays with at the table and puts away carefully when she's done... otherwise I imagine tictacs might work size wise if things are lost &#60;wink&#62;
Barbie Potty Training Taffy set is great for kids who have also just gotten their first puppy.  With Barbie and Taffy, children will learn about puppy potty training.My young niece loved playing with Barbie and Taffy.  Since she also just received two brand new puppies, this Barbie play set was particularly useful to demonstrate puppy potty training to her.  Taffy &#34;eats&#34; food (the food is dropped into a hole on Taffy's back), then with a press of the tail, she potties.  Barbie can then use her scooper to pick up the potty and put it in a bucket.My niece had hours of fun with this set.
My younger girls are big Barbie lovers, so they were thrilled with this. I turned them loose with it and had my older daughter help to set it up. She said that, although it was fun, the poop/treats were hard to figure out and set up.The toy itself was very fun, but the very small pieces and the hard setup would make it more appropriate for an older child even though the box says 6 and up.
When I saw the commercials for this toy on tv i thought REALLY?  What will they come up with next.  My daughter has really enjoyed this doll.  She seems to enjoy toys that mimic real life.  You can't get more realistic than this. You feed a dog and guess what!? He's gonna poop.  As a responsible pet owner Barbie has everything that she needs to clean up after him.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  She was of course locked up like Fort Knox in this box so it took awhile to free her, the pup and all the accessories.  Over all a fun toy that will provide hours of fun!
My granddaughter is a Barbie-crazed 8 year old and I'm having a little trouble getting her to take care of her little doggie, so I thought this might help.  It actually is kind of fun to play with - treats in and poop out - and she is getting a kick out of Barbie walking her dog.  I think this is actually a pretty good training tool for pet responsibility along with the fun of plastic poop.
ok these pieces are so small...they got lost within twenty minutes. my daughter was initially excited over a pooping dog but then it was relegated to just another barbie in the toy box.
My daughter absolutely adores this doll! The set comes with a pretty blonde barbie in a pair of cute pink capri pants and a flowered blue three quarter shirt. But the thing that makes it really special is Taffy. This adorable puppy dog is a very interactive toy for kids. You can actually feed it biscuits and it poops when you press on its tail!  This might seem odd to some, but my daughter thought it was the coolest feature ever. She loves picking up the poop with the little scooper and putting it in the trashcan. There's just something about pooping that's cool to little kids.Barbie and Taffy come with everything you need to be a responsible pet owner. There's a food bowl, trash bin, leash, biscuits and poop pellets. Some of these pieces are very tiny, so it's definitely only for kids around four and up. But Taffy does come with a little sack attached to her back which is the perfect place to store your treats and pellets when you aren't playing with them.With the pretty spring clothes and the promise of warm spring walks with your pooch, Barbie Potty Training Taffy is the perfect choice for little girls this Easter!
This is a cute set.  It includes a lovely blond haired, blue-eyed Barbie doll wearing a pretty capri set & high heels, her dog Taffy, a dog dish with little dog biscuits in it, a trashcan, a doggie lunchbox, a pooper scooper, and plastic poop.  The dog is a bit large to scale compared to the doll, in my opinion, but I guess it's supposed to be a super huge Golden Retriever or Lab, that looks like a puppy.The set is intended to train kids how to responsibly take care of dogs when you walk them, by picking up poo with the scooper and putting it in the garbage can, I guess.I guess Barbie has run out of ideas, because this one is a bit out there, in my opinion.  It's actually pretty comical.  I give it four stars because the doll is gorgeous and the set does come with a good assortment of accessories but I doubt the poop will be played with long.
Be the first in your family to give a little girl a toy with fake poop.  The look on the kid's face is worth it.  Little girls often want to do grown up tasks -- I mean, we already have toy vacuums, toy ovens, etc.  So why not the pretend responsibility of taking care of a dog.  The hardest part of this task is not losing the little pieces.  And frankly most girls will only use the dog poop at first and then probably play with the doll/dog minus the poop once the novelty wears off.
Leave it to Barbie to make such a realistic toy. My niece is a serious Barbie fan and absolutely thinks this is the coolest thing yet. It is good practice for teaching responsibility as she has been wanting a real pet. You feed the dog treats and then have to clean up the poop, just like real life. Sounds crazy, but of course the kids think it is great.
This is basically a &#34;girlier&#34; and &#34;cartoonier&#34; rerelease of the out of print Barbie and Tanner from awhile back.The older set had Barbie in earth tone clothes and a somewhat realistic dog, a pooper scooper and treats that Tanner pooped.This Barbie is more festive in her outfit that is so loud I can't hear what she's saying, and she has ridiculously high pumps! The expression of Taffy is very large eyed and when you press her head, her ears move, her eyes close, and her mouth opens. It's very comical!The new dog has a kind of saddle, and you put bone treats in her open mouth. When it closes she swallows!!You then load poop pellets (!!!) in Taffy's saddle slot. When you press her tail, it slides a butt door open so the poop can escape! The original Tanker used the same treats as poop, so this is a bit more realistic, though Taffy can gobble poop as well, just like a real dog, I guess.Anyway, the dog pooping is a little too much but the expression of closing its eyes to eat is pretty funny.I'm not into Barbie, but my sister is a Holiday Barbie fan and buys the upscale dolls sometimes.The packaging, novelty, and appearance of this set place it firmly in the realm of children, but it's not a bad toy by modern standards.If you're okay with pooping dogs, give this set a whirl!
Why are kids so enthralled with toys that poop? Perhaps they are able to see the humor in a thing meant for play exhibiting such a mundane, but necessary bodily function...oh, and poops is funny, the most funny thing actually to the under 10 set. Anyway, my daughter, 8, and my son, 6, both found this pooping dog hilarious and played with it for a good hour and a half after we opened the box. The next day the cousins came over and more pooping fun was had by all. Poor Barbie was mostly abandoned during this time except for the occasional poop scoop duty. My daughter said that she wants to get this as the present for all her friends' birthdays. Thanks Mattel!
My niece had an older version of this. And it was such a hit, when I saw this updated version, I had to get it. Barbie just a filler for this fun set. The eating/pooping dog is the star here. This updated version has a dog with a leash this time. And not only can eat and poop, but access to items in his stomach through the pink pack on his back. And there are bone-shaped treats this time as well, besides just the food/poo. Not only is it entertaining (funny), but it teaches responsible pet ownership by having to pick up after your pet with the poop scooper. The novelty of this toy just doesn't wear off with the little girls (and boys!) that I know.
My four year old daughter loves this doll and her dog. For some reason she is fascinated by the fact that the dog produces poop pellets, which you then have to pick up with the scooper. She gets a kick out of it. Also, you can feed the dog little bone snacks which can then be removed from a small compartment on the side of the dog. The Barbie herself is well-made and cute, and she comes with a leash to 'walk' her dog. Overall its a nice toy, but the poop pellets and dog snacks are tiny and can get lost very easily, so be careful if you have other smaller children at home.
