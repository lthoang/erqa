I have to confess that I am nostalgic for the easy bake oven - when I was a kid it was my ultimate dream to bake my own cookie supply in my room.  And evidently my daughter feels the same way - she's nutz for this thing.But now that I'm an adult my practical side takes over.  This $40 easy bake comes with mix for 12 chocolate chip &#34;cookie bites&#34;...I ate a couple bites and they were not that tasty and I can buy a whole tub of them at Trader Joe's for $3.  The refill pizza mix is $15 - I can't imagine that the pizza taste will be that great and I can buy my daughter a massive great-tasting pizza at Pappa John's for $9 and I'll let her bake it in our Wolf oven (with me supervising).So my daughter loves it for the feelings it represents - she's growing up and she's cooking her own stuff.  I don't love it because I'm grown up and sadly am a realistic now - expensive, slow to cook, messy cleanup, and more clutter in the bedroom.  But hey when I was her age I thought it was the greatest thing too - overall I rate 3-stars from my adult view (though my daughter says she rates 5-stars - but she doesn't have to buy the refills).

Reviews:
"I got this for my son who loves to ""play kitchen"" thinking that we could make things together. I was aware it would be large, but now I'm not sure where we're going to keep it! At least it's black and it almost blends in to the kitchen appliances so I can pass it off for a while!Anyway, we were disappointed in how tiny the cookies are and how there's only one packet of mix in the box. We're going to have to spend a lot on specialty mixes unless I can figure a way to use ""real"" mixes or tubes of cookies from the store.The unit itself is easy to use. I like that there is no longer a bulb to have to replace. It put off a fair amount of heat while baking and for a little while afterwards. It felt like it took a long time to preheat for a small handful of cookies to bake and cool in about 15 minutes. It felt like a giant waste of electricity.I remember how Easy Bake used to be able to make cakes in round pans. That would have been nice for this model too. The mixes look pretty limited in what you can make. That being said, both my boys ate the cookies with much gusto and I was apparently too slow to get one!Don't be fooled by the ""cooling"" time. We still used an oven mitt when handling the cookie pan. I would recommend doing that, if nothing else, to teach kids that mitts are necessary when dealing with hot stuff.I'm really mixed on the whole thing. My boys enjoyed it, but for how long? We'll just have to see I guess.By the way, why does the pink model come with a cupcake pan and the black doesn't???"
This is a nice upgrade to a classic toy. No more cooking with lightbulbs! Just plug it in and it's ready to use. The design is sleek and modern. The oven comes with enough baking supplies to cook chocolate chip cookies and red velvet cake with icing and sprinkles. There are  a lot of other food options available too, even pretzels. We enjoyed measuring and mixing and waiting for the tasty treats. The pastries are small but a nice portion size for little ones. The pastries are surprisingly flavorful. This oven is still as enjoyable as the older model easy bake oven that I loved as a kid. My toddler enjoys it (with assistance from an adult of course) and frequently asks to use it.
"I got the Easy Bake Ultimate Oven for my little boy. What woman doesn't love it when a man can cook?! ;) He's almost 3, so not quite the targeted age, but we still had fun with it.What we like:-I like that it's purple, which is a LITTLE bit more on the neutral side.-It cooks very quickly. You preheat for 20 minutes and then cook an average of 10 minutes or so. You get exact directions, though. I was expecting a MUCH longer cook time.What we didn't like:-You can't watch the food while it cooks. I wish the front was clear, and it would have made this a much better learning tool, and made it a lot more fun.-The portions are TINY! Seriously, I don't think it would fill up a mouse! But, I guess I have to expect tiny portions for it to cook so quickly. And, I think it's more of a ""time together"" kind of activity!Just some neutral information we learned. You can cook ""regular"" food in the oven. If you're like us, you can't pay a lot of money for tiny mixes that produce 1/10th of the size of a normal cookie. Just save a little batter from when you cook. I also learned that you CAN burn food in this oven. :) So make sure you set a timer.The pictures in the directions have cute, perfect little cookies and cupcakes. Ours didn't even come close to looking that great. Maybe with a little more practice?!This oven comes with a batch of cookies and cupcakes w/frosting, sugar crystals, and cupcake wraps. It also has two cooking pans and an ""arm"" to push the pans into the oven. It has spots marked to make sure you get them to the correct spot to cook and cool. Overall, we've had a lot of fun with it!And this is probably obvious, but it's electric. ;)"
In my memory the Easy Bake Oven was bigger and better than this.  The mixes and pans are so very tiny they are hard to work with.  It was a bit fun playing with this again now as an adult, but it's just not worth the money, time or effort needed to get these tiny little treats baked.  Save yourself some money and frustrations and just take your child into your kitchen and make some goodies the old fashioned way.
"I had some Easy Bake mixes when I was a kid - but not the oven. I remember making them in our regular oven when I was around 6 - and getting my first burn when I grabbed a pan out without a potholder :(  I always wanted the Easy Bake Oven.My 8 year old just received the ""new"" Easy Bake Ultimate Oven. Even though she has been baking with me since age 3, she was over the moon with excitement to get her OWN oven.  She read the directions and did every step herself.  She baked chocolate chip cookies. While no one would mistake them for ""from scratch"" toll-house cookies, they weren't bad and were promptly devoured.The oven takes 20 minutes to preheat (a regular oven would be 10 minutes).  There is a fake ""timer"" that says 10:15. You can't see the items baking - the door appears translucent but items are not visible.  That said, the oven is very cute and seems safe. It would be very difficult for a child to manage to burn herself.  In fact, when the ""cookie sheet"" first came out of the ""cooling chamber"" my daughter grabbed it with her bare hand - as I did all those years ago - and it was just slightly warm to the touch - no burns or blisters.One thing was confusing - the directions instruct you to turn off/unplug oven AFTER cooling. We wondered if that was a mistake - seems more logical to turn off oven after baking but before cooling?We would like to get a couple of more pans (at least the ""checkerboard"" pan). Not sure how many more mixes we would purchase - we'll probably try some recipes over at eborecipes.com  I also read a recommendation to use small amounts of regular cake mixes.  Hasbro would probably sell more mixes if they were priced more fairly."
My four-year-old daughter was very excited to receive this, as she is a lover of food and cooking. It looks fun and stylish.Basically, it includes the oven, the tool, one small (tiny) pan, 1 cookie mix, and the instructions.PROS:1. It heated up in a reasonable amount of time. It baked the cookies in the suggested time.2. It looks fun. My daughter was able to do almost everything herself.CONS:1. My husband and I both had a bit of a bother using the tool and getting our pan of cookies out. The tray kept catching on the metal flap on the end of the baking chamber.2. You can't really watch the cookies bake. There is no way to know for sure they are done without removing them completely from the oven.3. The mix says it makes 12 cookies, but unless you are an ant, they are crumbs at best. I made them into 6 cookies so we could feel like it was an actual cookie.4. The mix it slightly grainy. Let's face it, this oven is not for making great-tasting baked goods, but for the fun of baking.5. I think the age is off on this. It says it for ages 8 and up, but at 9 or 10, you can use a regular oven. I would say, for the average kid, 5 or 6 would be spot on.6. The mixes are EXPENSIVE for what you get and how they taste.7. My daughter loves this oven, and so we will keep using it, but in a couple years she will have out-grown it.I recommend this with reservations. It is what it is. If it encourages kids to cook, then it is worthwhile.
Reviewers need to remember this is a toy not a real oven. Food is not regular size. Mix and portions are tiny to teach basic cooking to a child. The perfect size for a tea party. Makes a great snack, not too big to spoil and appetite.I got this to share with my 7 year old grandaughter and 11 year old son. He now wants to learn how to cook more things.Most important is the time we can spend together making our own creations.
"This product review is part of my obligation to Amazon for accepting to be a member of the Vine program, a club of selected customers that provide opinions about ""new and pre-released items."" We enter this club by accepting free copies of products but we promise in return to submit an opinion.The Easybake ultimate oven has a good appearance and it is made of durable, sturdy plastic, so it is a toy that will last.The oven has no door: the cooking tray is pushed in from the left and pulled out from the right. This makes it awkward and it does not reflect the reality we face when cooking in a real oven.The instructions read that adult supervision is required and... frankly speaking... it is necessary because the graphics are such that only an adult would be able to understand; for example... rather than the simple word NO... to any action, the EASYBAKE oven instructions display provides a picture of the action in question under a circle with a line in the middle, something that an adult who already drives will recognize immediately but a child would not understand.To fully appreciate the toy, we had actual children attempt to do the baking with us. Heating time is 20 minutes, cooking time for six [6] cupcakes is 10 minutes, cooling time another 5 minutes. The mix is for 12 cupcakes, so after 50 minutes we had 12 cupcakes, each 7/8 of an inch in diameter.The kids did not even try to frost them because they were so small. Between the two ""6 cupcakes cooking"" we had to wash by hand the cooking tray, since only one is provided.In the same amount of time we could have baked, using a mix, 12 regular size cupcakes and frosted them too. It is a toy that will be used only once and has no teaching value."
Well, this ain't your little sister's Easy Bake Oven.  I guess the classic design is still available but this model provides a stylish alternative.  I love that it comes in a color other than pink.  We do a fair amount of cooking at home and my son was very excited to be able to cook something without our help.  This isn't a toaster oven heated with a lightbulb.  After preparing your dough and arranging the tiny cookies on the tray, you slide the tray into a slot in the side of the unit.  You then set a timer and wait.  When the timer is done you use the supplied spatula thingy to push the tray out the other side.  I think I prefer the idea of the more traditional form since this version doesn't really have an adult equivalent in our kitchen.  Still, my son enjoys it and it's easy to use. I do think they should include a timer.  It's pretty stupid that they have a fake clock on the outside and not pony up the extra manufacturing dollar or whatever for a working timer.
I loved my Easy Bake Oven as a kid and played with it constantly. I hoped my daughters would love this as much as I loved mine. But the difference between mine then and this now was just way too huge.The mixes are tiny, make barely anything and cost a fortune. A pack of cookie mix at Walmart is around 8 dollars. Since I bake with the kids at home anyway, we could buy about 7 boxes of standard oven cookie mix for that price and get dozens of full size cookies as opposed to a handful of mini cookies.Remember how we all had a couple cake tins and such to chose from? Not here, as you get 1 cookie sheet. You can purchase others for an additional price.This version is a huge money suck that hasn't improved over the original except for making it more visualizing appealing. It's pretty and that's going to entice buyers, but it honestly isn't worth the month at all.
This was NOT the Easy-Bake oven that I had when I was a kid.  Pans kept getting stuck, fingers kept getting burned, and kids kept getting bored.  Real disappointing.
I have to confess that I am nostalgic for the easy bake oven - when I was a kid it was my ultimate dream to bake my own cookie supply in my room.  And evidently my daughter feels the same way - she's nutz for this thing.But now that I'm an adult my practical side takes over.  This $40 easy bake comes with mix for 12 chocolate chip &#34;cookie bites&#34;...I ate a couple bites and they were not that tasty and I can buy a whole tub of them at Trader Joe's for $3.  The refill pizza mix is $15 - I can't imagine that the pizza taste will be that great and I can buy my daughter a massive great-tasting pizza at Pappa John's for $9 and I'll let her bake it in our Wolf oven (with me supervising).So my daughter loves it for the feelings it represents - she's growing up and she's cooking her own stuff.  I don't love it because I'm grown up and sadly am a realistic now - expensive, slow to cook, messy cleanup, and more clutter in the bedroom.  But hey when I was her age I thought it was the greatest thing too - overall I rate 3-stars from my adult view (though my daughter says she rates 5-stars - but she doesn't have to buy the refills).
"In the 80's my sister and I shared the Betty Crocker Easy Bake Oven.  Yes, it looked like a microwave, yes, it took ages for that lightbulb to cook a cake, and yes, I did manage to burn myself once or twice on it - but nonetheless, it was a fun toy and we enjoyed coming home from school and baking little treats without having to bother mom to turn on the ""big oven"".  With two little kids of my own, it was a thrill to test out the new 2013 Easy Bake Ultimate Oven!While the Ultimate Oven looks like a big upgrade over my 85' Easy Bake, the overall unit is the same - there are still two little doors to push the tray into, there is still a huge gap between the heated area and the outside so little fingers won't get burned, and push tool is still made of plastic and can burn if carelessly left inside of the unit for too long.  The biggest change is the lack of lightbulb heating.  With it's own built in heating element there is no need to get replacement bulbs and the heating is more even throughout the oven.  However, this does not mean that it's any faster than the older units.  The unit still takes 20 minutes to heat up, and about 10 minutes to bake those teeny little cookies.  This wasn't too big of an issue with our kids, as the excitement of baking trumped everything and because they're younger, it took about 20 minutes for them to carefully shape each one of those teeny little cookies.  Overall, the experience was a lot of fun for my 4 and 5 year old kids, and I liked that they have the option of ""baking themselves"" and having only a few tiny cookies to chomp down instead of a dozen of regular sized cookies to sugar up on.  Overall, the unit worked just as well as the old version, and my kids found it really fun to make their own cookies.  One thing to note is that you definitely would want to get a small oven mitt for those little hands...as ""burn safe"" as this product is, it's always the pan that burns kids, so be warned now!One thing I wasn't impressed with is that this unit comes with only one baking pan.  The standard purple unit comes with a cookie sheet and a cupcake pan.  On the upside, without that pan, I won't have to buy the tiny liners that fit with that pan only.  Either way, my kids didn't notice it missing, so it was all good.  All in all, the Easy Bake Ultimate Oven is a toy that's great for kids who love to cook, but are still a little too young to use an actual oven without tons of help.  While the longevity of play with this toy may be short, we're definitely going to enjoy it while it last.  Recommended.One more note:If you're feeling ambitious, you may want to check outEasybake Oven Gourmet.  It gives really interesting background history of the Easy Bake Oven, and has awesome recipes for a refined palate (aka, this book is for adults who love the oven, and *maybe* the kids.  My sister got this book one year and actually tried out a couple of the recipes - they came out surprisingly good!  And if waiting by the Easy Bake isn't for you, you can use your regular oven as well (but what fun is that?)"
I was very excited to get the Easy Bake Oven to play with my daughter and nephew. They had a BLAST making their own mixes. Just as I remember, the Easy Bake is very easy to use. This is the updated version, so it doesn't have a light bulb, like the older ones did. You just plug in and you're ready to go. I do recommend that if there's more than three or four kids you get extra of the mixes. They make very small portions, so it might not feed as many as you would think. Other than that, it's very fun and easy to use!
I followed the stories about how there was a demand for a &#34;boy&#34; colored Easy Bake oven with amusement but when I saw this black and blue model I thought it would be a great toy for my grandson, age 4.  He's been helping mom bake for years and one of his favorite apps on my phone is the Easy Bake one so I figured this was bound to be a hit.  I thought I knew what I'd be getting, after all I had gotten one for his mom when she was little and it had been a very popular item for a couple years.  What a disappointment!  This is a pricey toy for what it is, add to that the skimpy quantity the mix produces and that you only get one tiny &#34;cookie sheet&#34; no cupcake pan, no other mixes except for the lonely packet of chocolate chip mix! Wow.  Now take into account that the oven takes forever to get hot enough to &#34;cook&#34; and that there is no indicator as to when it is hot enough.  The directions for the included mix say that it is supposed to make 12 cookies -- is this a joke?? -- there is barely 1/3 cup of dry mix and to get 12 cookies you'd have to make them each about the size of a cough drop.  I bought several refill packs of mixes so that we'd be able to whip up a bunch of goodies over a weekend but after the initial cookies didn't cook until they'd been put back in the oven for double time, and given how difficult it was to find a tiny spoon to scoop little teeny cookie dough drops onto the cookie sheet, the kids all lost interest.  The only reason I gave this two stars is because the cookies did have flavor.  My rating is more generous than Hasbro was is this remake of what was once a great childhood memory.
My girls loved this. They actually received a similar one years ago when they were only 2 and 4, and we gave it away when moved since it would be several years before they could use it (based on suggested age restrictions). So I was excited to be able to receive one now that they're old enough to use and appreciate it.Personally, I like the updated, unisex design although my daughters could really care less how it looks.It's easy to use, easy to set up, and easy to clean.The oven only comes with one mix - for cookies, a tray, and a spatula/pusher tool, but you know that when you purchase it. Could it have come with more mixes? Sure. Absolutely. But the reality is that it does not. Having said that, if you Google &#34;easy bake oven recipes&#34; you'll get lots of hits, including a website dedicated to homemade recipes for the machine. Your other option is to purchase the recipes from the store, but they're not cost effective at all.Besides the expensive mixes, the other issue is that the tray you use is so tiny I don't feel like a single child (let alone two) will get enough treats from your recipes to consider it even a snack amount.But both the girls love it, they like baking with their friends, and the toy isn't much of a hassle to use, which is why I give it 4 stars.
"I always wanted an easy bake oven as a child. So having the opportunity to try this particular model was fun and exciting for me and my children.My children 7 and 5 both love to play pretend, especially kitchen and resturant games. Its been pretend food until now, but this ""toy"" gives them a chance to make real food.This model includes the oven of course, a baking pan, pan tool, a chocolate chip cookie mix and instructions. I love the color its perfect for an child and has the look of modern appliances.I'm not sure why I was thinking it would run on batteries but it doesn't you just plug it in so that's great. You also want to make sure you have somewhere to store it. I don't let the kids keep it in their rooms for obvious reasons. Its about the size of one of those gorge forman grills. I have cupboard space but that may be a problem for others.Yes the size of the baking pan is small and it doesn't make a ton of whatever your making. However I know if I make a dozen regular size cookies they will get eaten by the kids and possibly by me as well. I don't like my kids to eat a ton of junk so I think the servings are perfect.The box shows kids that could possibly be teenagers. That's to old for this toy, a preteen or teenager should know how to use a stove and oven at that age even if its under supervision.Its a perfect toy for kids around my children's age, and you can look up recipes online for the easy bake oven so you don't have to spend a fortune on refills.kids today watch to much tv or want to play video games and stare at tablets. Slow your child down and bake with them, you can even read a book together while you wait for your yummy treats! Such a great toy, and a perfect addition to the kitchen."
"I really wanted the kids to love this, but something is different from the ones that they made when I was a kid (the old fashioned real light bulb ones). The food mixes are very expensive, the cheapest I could find was $2.39 each.The food doesn't taste that good, our picky eater refused to even taste it. The cookies and cakes are so small that they are hard to decorate and overall, while this has alot of potential and that ""wow"" factor, in reality it does not live up to the hype"
My wife and I got our daughter an Easy Bake Oven a few years ago. It was a standard model, no 'special edition' or anything like that, and included the oven, two utensils for cutting/scooping, two pans, two warming cups (for melting toppings), a 'pan pusher' (for inserting/removing pans), and three mixes. My wife and I were never crazy about it, as it always seemed to take a long time to cook and the the mixes weren't particularly good. Our daughter loved it...We decided to get one for our younger daughter, so we got the Easy Bake Ultimate oven. Although it looks a lot nicer, calling this the 'Ultimate' oven is a stretch, if not outright false advertising. For starters, it has almost no accessories... it comes with a baking pan, tool to insert/remove the pan, and one mix. It's debatable whether these extra accessories were 'necessary', however my daughter loved using them and they're selling them over on eBay, so apparently people still want them. It also STILL does not include it's own timer... just a picture of a clock. How hard would it be to add a simple timer to this thing? My wife ended up buying a digital stand-alone timer for $4.Strangely, a purple version of this oven is available with extra mixes, a second pan, and paper cupcake wraps... for the same price...The new feature for this model is the lack of a light bulb for heating (this model uses it's own heat source), however we bought a 4-pack of bulbs when we got our first oven and still have three left, so for us this feature is a minor convenience at best. Second, the oven now accommodates larger pans, which is the one decent feature this model has over our previous oven.Overall, it works fine, my kids love it, but from a parents standpoint the mixes are just 'ok', the bake time is long, and this model in particular is FAR from an Ultimate edition.
"I just finished baking the second of two mixes that came with this product with my 5 1/2 year-old daughter.  To make 12 half-bite, frosted cupcakes took 20 minutes of ""preheating,"" 20 minutes of baking, and 10 minutes of cooling plus another 5ish minutes of mixing and direction reading.  If I am going to spend nearly an hour of baking, I want more than 6 bites of output.  That said, my daughter thought the cupcakes, especially, with the frosting and sprinkles were wonderful fun to make, and her older sister certainly helped eat the cupcakes.As a tool to teach direction following, the oven is fine.  I miss being able to see the food cooking as was possible in the original version, and the non-timer is purely decoration rather that having a useful function.  I received this oven as part of the Vine program, and I am sure if I had paid for it that I would have been disappointed.  It will probably be moving to the storage room, as it is quite large and there is no way it will fit anywhere in my kitchen cupboards.As an adult, I can't recommend this toy at the price being charged."
The Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven is a wonderful way to introduce cooking to kids! The only problems with the oven has not changed since 1963- these two problems being the 20 minutes it takes to warm up the oven and the cost of the mixes. I can't help with the 20 minute wait time (my own electric oven takes almost that long!), but I can help with the cost of the mixes. In 1963 when the first Easy-Bake oven came out, my cousins got one for Christmas. My Aunt, who hated messes in the kitchen, found it easier to teach the children to mix a batch of cookie dough from scratch, roll up meatball size balls of dough, double wrap them in plastic and then baggies and into the freezer. She would then take out one ball of dough the night before they would use it and put it in the refrigerator. Several times a week, my cousins came home from school, finding the little dough ball thawed out and just waiting for them in the refrigerator to put it in the Easy-Bake oven after the 20 minute warm up. They did this for years- from one child to the next, that little oven got it's money's worth baking tiny bite sized cookies and cakes for everyone.This new Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven is designed like the original 1963 model- where the child must slide the cookies or cake into the oven with a long pan tool, and then remove it with the long tool when it's done, avoiding any contact with the heating element inside. (The only difference in 1963- is that they used a light bulb instead of a heating element.) Over the years Hasbro changed the oven's design, making it open in the front, causing burn issues for children, so now they've come back to the original and safer design, where little hands cannot get inside near the heating element. It's great they made this Ultimate oven safe again. This limited edition color of black was actually a request from a little girl who thought a neutral color would be nice for both girls and boys to have, and Hasbro agreed and made this black oven. This Easy-Bake oven comes with the pan tool which has a spatula on one end and a push tool on the other, a tiny baking pan and one cookie mix. All you do to bake the enclosed cookies, is pre-heat the oven for 20 minutes, spray cooking oil on the pan, make the dough, roll it into a ball (and it is the size of a meatball, just like in 1963), from the meatball size dough ball you make 12 tiny balls, put them on the tiny baking pan, press each ball flatter, using the push tool- into the oven, bake 9 minutes, cool in the cooling chamber 5 minutes and enjoy!With today's Ultimate oven, some of the original cake pans are no longer made, but you can buy a cup cake pan for $7.00 or you can buy a special checker cake pan ring for $23.00 that sits on the tiny baking pan that comes with this unit and bake a checker cake. The cupcakes and cakes are so tiny compared to the original 1963 cakes, but the kids love the teensy cupcakes and adore the teensy checker cake (this cake is really unique with it's checkerboard design using different mixes!), so I have to say that even though the prices are high on these pans, you can save a fortune on your mixes, so yes, these are worth buying. Now for the mixes we have used:We have used our own cookie mixes made from scratch, rolling them into meatball size balls and double wrap each ball and into baggies and the freezer. The night before I just move one ball from the freezer into the refrigerator and the next day it's thawed and ready to bake in the oven. The cookie doughs that freeze best are: chocolate chip, peanut butter, sugar cookies and shortbreads. If you buy the cupcake pan, try brownies- the brownie mixes freeze perfectly and are so delicious when frosted with a can of frosting. Those cans of frosting stay perfect in the refrigerator for weeks! Again just freeze the mixed brownie mix in meatball size amounts- only triple wrap and into baggies. The cake and brownie mixes do better triple wrapped in the freezer. And make sure when you wrap the cookie mixes or brownie mixes for the freezer, that they are wrapped tightly- leaving no air for icey water damage. These cookie and brownie mixes stay good in the freezer, wrapped well for a couple of months!For cake mixes, we mix a cake mix either from scratch or from a box, pour into a couple of those plastic ice cube trays with individual cubes and let them set up in the freezer. We then remove the little squares of frozen cake mix and individually triple wrap them and into baggies and into the freezer. When your kids want to bake a cake or cupcakes, you can take the cube of cake batter out of the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes or a little longer. That's it, the batter is now ready to bake, while the oven is heating up. You spend one day of making a large batter of cake mix or a large amount of cookie dough or brownie mix and with the extra time of wrapping these small portions and freezing them, you are good for a couple of months for your children to enjoy baking in their Easy-Bake oven. The cost is a few cents for every baking session, instead of $5.00 for one mix! We also found that those Betty Crocker inexpensive bags of mixes for only .79 to $1.99 make for less mess and smaller amounts to freeze! Betty Crocker also now has gluten free cookie mixes! And we found Mrs. Fields has her fantastic cookie mixes in smaller boxes for cheap prices as well! The kids loved these and also found a boxed confetti cake mix and a banana cake mix that they love to make so much, we can't keep enough of it in the freezer! A favorite for the checker cake is using chocolate cake with banana cake. One day of mixing and freezing will give you months of happy little bakers with only a couple dollars spent! Thank goodness cake mixes freeze well, as our kids have already dropped hints that they want to make whoopie pies with the Easy-Bake Ultimate Whoopie Pie Kit!
The Easy-Bake Ultimate Oven takes the concept from the past and gives it a modern update. This silver and black model curved oven will be popular with both boys and girls.It no longer bakes using a light bulb; just plug it in and it's ready to go.Young bakers use the included baking mixes to prepare delicious, bite-sized treats such as cookies or muffins. You can purchase refill packs or using the Easy-Bake Treats mobile app, download other recipes.The oven comes with all of the tools (baking pan, pan tool) you need to get started, and mix for chocolate chip cookies.No assembly is required. The manufacturer recommends this for children ages 8 and older, although I think a younger child could use it with adult supervision. This is a great way to safely teach young children about baking.
