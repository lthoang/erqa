I ordered this reading system to test it with my 5-year-old niece who had started Pre-K this year.When I took the box over to her house; however, I was unable to install the system on the pen. This is the biggest fault of the product - the books do no come preinstalled on the reading pen device. If you have an old computer, be aware that you might not be able to get the Reading System to work.I had to take the pen back and install two software to get the books onto the pen. Once I did that, I had the niece play with the Reading System. It's amazing! It's educational and fun. And she really liked pointing to the words and hearing the system read them to her. In a way, this toy is more practical as a babysitter than a TV - the child learns to read and hears sound at the same time! It's definitely a one-person-toy though, as the child needs to hold the pen and point it to specific words.This product is also a beginner's kit. It contains the Reading System and a sample book - each two-page book spread is from a different book. I know that in order to please my niece I have to now purchase some of these full books.The toy is durable - it fell to the floor several times out of little hands  but was fine. It's a bit heavy for a small child, but is hefty enough for a 5-year-old.Overall, I'd recommend this product for its innovation and fun way to get the children to read, but would caution against purchasing it for anyone who isn't computer savvy and/or doesn't ave the latest computer device at home.

Reviews:
After seeing numerous commercials about Leap Frog products--and the Toy Story characters on the front of the activity book (my daughter's current obsession)--I was excited to receive this product.  I was unaware of the set-up procedures which require Internet access, but the directions were clear so that was not a problem.But I was disappointed that the system did not come with an actual storybook (all sold separately).  Instead, all we received was a very thin sampler paperback with a handful of activities and two-page excerpts from some of the books sold separately.  My daughter is only two, so she mostly just jabs the wand at various pictures to hear the noises, but I was pleased when she picked up the wand and book on her own as she hadn't seemed interested when I first tried to go through the book with her.  If the wand came with at least one complete storybook, I think this would be a much better value.
I ordered this reading system to test it with my 5-year-old niece who had started Pre-K this year.When I took the box over to her house; however, I was unable to install the system on the pen. This is the biggest fault of the product - the books do no come preinstalled on the reading pen device. If you have an old computer, be aware that you might not be able to get the Reading System to work.I had to take the pen back and install two software to get the books onto the pen. Once I did that, I had the niece play with the Reading System. It's amazing! It's educational and fun. And she really liked pointing to the words and hearing the system read them to her. In a way, this toy is more practical as a babysitter than a TV - the child learns to read and hears sound at the same time! It's definitely a one-person-toy though, as the child needs to hold the pen and point it to specific words.This product is also a beginner's kit. It contains the Reading System and a sample book - each two-page book spread is from a different book. I know that in order to please my niece I have to now purchase some of these full books.The toy is durable - it fell to the floor several times out of little hands  but was fine. It's a bit heavy for a small child, but is hefty enough for a 5-year-old.Overall, I'd recommend this product for its innovation and fun way to get the children to read, but would caution against purchasing it for anyone who isn't computer savvy and/or doesn't ave the latest computer device at home.
This product is very well made.  It's design and simplicity make it a great tool for the little ones to gain confidence learning to read on their own.  Strangely enough, the smaller we are the larger the item the better, and this learning tool is very well sized and makes it fun for them to interact with.
My family has used an older Leapfrog Tag system for almost two years. We have also given Tag systems as presents. They hold our children's attention and are educational and fun. Children enjoy completing the activities and claiming their prizes. While the recommended age range is 4 to 8, I would put it at ages 3 to 7.The system's utility depends on the books. We have about a dozen or so titles including two picture card sets and the alphabet board. Our youngest is becoming adept at sounding out three letter words, so I selected this product for her to have her own Tag. Each child should really have his/her own Tag. With our children, the older one reads very well and could do all the games and complete the rewards. It made the younger child feel left behind. With separate pens, the younger child can experience the excitement of completing games and rewards.The larger memory is handy. I no longer need to juggle books and activities. The color scheme is OK--darker than the older Tag, but similar in general. Different colors are available but it appears only on the LeapFrog website for now. As far as ergonomics, this new style is perhaps slightly easier to handle but any differences are minor. The original design worked well, so no sense changing anything dramatically. We generally use slow self-discharge rechargeable batteries with these systems.
We haven't had much luck with educational toys -- since all they seem to teach our son is that learning isn't fun.  It's just the opposite with the Leapfrog Tag.  He loves to run the pen over the words, hear the sounds, and play the games -- all by himself.  He is enthralled with the Spiderman and Scooby-Doo books (which I bought separately).  What is he learning?  Frankly, I don't much care.  Five year olds deserve to have toys that they like that don't teach them a darn thing.  But I do think he's growing to understand what words look like since he moves the pen to each new word confidently, and that's one of the first steps in being a confident reader.
I loved this so much that I bought a second reader for my second child, now I'll probably have to get a third because my third child is almost old enough to use it.  My eldest loves it the most, she's five and she can't get enough of the fact that it reads to her.  She doesn't follow the story, she likes to click randomly and then repeat the word as if she was reading it.  But that's great because it will help her learn to read!  My middle child (3) doesn't quite understand it, but she plays along because her big sister does it.  I got a great sale on books and now I've got so many that I can't keep all of them in the reader's memory.  The only drawback, in fact, is the memory.  A 2 GB USB stick is $3 online now, couldn't they have put at least 1 GB in this without changing the production cost?  In fact, wouldn't 1 GB of memory cost less than 32 MB?  Regardless, the reader should hold their complete library and all new books that they conceivably might release during the life of the reader because memory is so cheap!  That one technical detail aside, I definately recommend this to everyone with a 3 year or older child!!
"My friend visited with her 5 year old and he had this set. My 3.5 yo daughter totally fell in love with it, she does not need the Jr. system, and those books seem a bit ""young"" for her anyway. She had no problem following the games and logic of the Tag system. I was very happy to find I could use the normal TAG to read TAG Jr. Books. I have an 18mo and got her a few of the harder paged books as I don't want her to rip the expensive books when playing with her sister.My friends pen was missing the back battery cover, so while the batteries are hard to wedge in, they stay in very well even if your back cover is missing. By the way its attached you would not think it would fall off, I did not ask how she lost hers.We got the purple one, and 2 books and one Jr. color book. My daughter is so happy, she just loves this. I would love some more reading books and spelling books for the kids! We got ours at Barnes and Noble, it was oddly enough not in the kid section, but in a separate little stand about 30 feet away, they did not have any Dr. Seuss books, hopefully target will so we can get green eggs and ham.We got the Tangled, Fancy Nancy and Curious George (jr.) books. We love them! My daughter is really enjoying the ""I spy"" game which was in the booklet the tag came with.GOOD STUFF!!! I use a macbook pro, and had previously installed the Leak Frog system for the scout/violet puppies and everything was slow but worked just fine."
This tag reader is very quick and easy to use, and my daughter loves it. She finally got interested in it when she became more interested in ABCs. I think the sampler book is helpful so you can find out what type of books your child will want to use with the reader. We use this with the Tag Junior books right now. They are easy to upload into the reader with the online tool, and the pen can hold at least 6-10 books at a time. I like that this pen works with regular tag and tag junior because it remains useful as your child grows. It also has auto shutoff which is great.
"disclaimer: I am reviewing a unit I received for free through the Vine program.Summary: Interesting idea, decent hardware, can be fun. BUT, sneaky way to suck you in to ongoing purchases of more books.The device (like a fat ballpoint pen) works well, straight out of the box (it's preloaded with the data for the sample book), downloads new content from the PC/web application OK, though the PC application is indeed clunky.Buying this unit (Leapfrog TAG Reading System) is like buying a DVD player, or an MP3 player. You are just buying the base platform with no content! (except for a short sample).The content comes in short books that are all sold separately and all cost $14 US each.The content seems unfortunately to be all based on Disney etc. (Spongebob, Spiderman, ...) other commercial characters. The good thing is that your kid is probably familiar with the characters. The bad thing of course is that it's just more corporate control over your kid's imagination...We bought one content book, the Spongebob Squarepants one. $14 US retail. It's a fairly short story, just a few pages long, mostly pictures. You can click with the TAG to read the whole story, or read specific words. There are hotspots you can click on the pictures to get characters to say things or make noises. And there are games you can play that make you click on one word, then another matching/derived word etc.There IS something good about having this out in the ""real world"" with no ""screens"" involved, no PC's, laptops, not even iPods, just this little TAG pen and the content book (once you download the data for that book, through your PC).So you can sit with your kid, with this TAG pen and this physical book, and they're clicking on stuff in the book, and it's making sound etc., and there are some good things that can be learned.But much of the content is not all that great. well, depends if your kid can already recognize a lot of words or not. and the design of the book content plus TAG hotspots is not always that great, some of it is very confusing to the (5-year old) kid because of the poor design."
"The tag system is a fun way to supplement your child's reading skills. Start with inserting batteries and you are on your way. Of course, you have to use the designated Tag books (cost starting around $8 for each one). That is the only downside. If you are willing to buy a few, the kids will have fun.The Tag Reader comes with a book that is a sampler of the different kinds of books available. I particularly like the ""I Spy"" and the geographical ones. You can also get popular media-related books like ""Toy Story 3"" and ""The Princess and the Frog"", as well as many, many more.Usage: You can press an icon that will read the story for your child, or the child can touch indiviual words as he moves the pen along. You can also change the function at the bottom of the pages, so the child can learn indiviual phonetical sounds as well.The pen is comfortable to hold. The age range is young, but my six-year-old has fun with it as well as my 16 month-old. I have not done this yet, but you can connect online and download additional things at their website.It's a fun tool if you have the means to buy the books. I personally wouldn't use it to teach my child to read, but it makes a great supplement."
"I was a little skeptical about this product at first.  I have seen the Tag Junior used by kids and while it is a neat technology, it left me wanting.But the Tag is much better than the Tag Junior.  It allows a child to do so much more.  The child can have whole paragraphs read to them or they can tap word by word and be told what words are on the page.  There are books that are more focused on teaching and others on entertaining but most have a mix of both.The initial set up was a little hard and took awhile but we do have an older and slower computer.The ""book"" that it comes with is really just an advertisement for other Tag products.  I did not realize that the Tag Pen could be used for other things than just reading until I flipped through it though.  They have a neat map, some educational animal flashcards (in association with National Geographic) and even some books that help with writing.The only reason I did not give this product five stars is because of cost.  Sure buying the initial pen will not break the bank, it is all of the extra books and accessories (which are super cool) that might."
The TAG reading system is a pen that can read the words in the TAG books. The pen comes with one sampler book then additional books must be purchased. A Leapfrog connection software must be downloaded first and then each book purchased must have the audio downloaded for it. I mention this because if you are still on dial-up, then you probably won't be able to use this for additional books. The connection software takes 4 hours to download alone. If you are on high speed then the download part will probably not be a issue for you.The product itself is really nice. You just rub the pen tip over the words in the book and the pen reads the word for your child. My 5 year loved this. Kids love anything techy so it makes learning to read fun and gets them interested in books. A total of 10 books can be loaded onto your pen out of about 40 available. Great for car trips, keeps the kids occupied while they are learning at the same time.
"I obtained the TAG Junior Learning System when I received a copy of theHuman Body Discovery Packfrom the Vine program.  When I received the system it came with a simple ""activity sampler book"" as an introduction to the system.  Essentially a child can work independently, but also can learn the basics of reading with some assistance.  There are an assortment of skills that children can learn via this system from reading comprehension basics to math and science, something that the Human Body Discovery Pack offers.WHAT'S INCLUDED:*  TAG reader*  ""Let's Play Tag!"" sampler book*  USB Cable*  TAG reader standOne of the things you may wish to add to your order would be theLeapFrog Storage Caseto keep your TAG reader and your storybooks in one place.  There are numerous skills that can be learned, depending on the books one selects.  Below I've simply listed some of the skills this popular system teaches.LEARNING SKILLS:*  Reading Comprehension*  Vocabulary/Languages*  Reading Basics/Spelling*  Critical Thinking/Memory*  Math/Science*  Nature/Society/LifeChildren can learn map skills, short vowels, long vowels, sight words, word sounds, they can learn about world culture, problem solving, deductive reasoning, the importance of social skills, rhyming, colors, subtraction ... you name it, basic educational skills can be found in abundance in a format that is exciting.  You can even purchase packs such as the popularLeapFrog Tag Learn to Read Phonics Book Series Short VowelsorLeapFrog Tag Junior Get Ready to Read(this takes a different tag).  This type of series that is especially useful if your are a homeschooler.Mind you, children can even develop or work on such things as fine motor skills as they work through a book.  For example, in order to progress from left to right in a story, the child must learn to aim the TAG reader carefully as he or she learns to ""read.""  The library of books comes in the form of storybooks, early readers, game books, interactive maps, and the Learn to Read & Write series.  Any of the following can be found on Amazon.  It's simply a fun, exiting system that I'd highly recommend to anyone who's child is highly motivated and interest in learning to read.LIST OF AVAILABLE BOOKS, CARTRIDGES, GAMES, & APPS.:*  United States of America Map*  Disney Beauty and the Beast*  Olivia*  Learn to Read, Book Sets 1, 2, 3*  Disney Cinderella:  The Heart that Believes*  Solar System Adventure Pack*  World Maps*  Chuggington:  Wilson and the Paint Wagon*  Learn to Write and Draw*  Disney Pixar Finding Nemo:  Lost and Found*  Disney Pixar Cars 2:  Project Undercover*  Game Book:  Penguins Puzzle Time*  Disney Rapunzel*  Disney Princess:  Adventures Under the Sea*  Disney Pixar Toy Story 3:  Together Again*  Pixar Pals Puzzle Time*  Disney Fairies:  Tinker Bell's True Talent*  Ni Hao, Kai-lan:  Kai-lan's Super Sleepover*  Scooby-Doo!

"I ordered this for my son even though the item said it was pink because the green wasn't an option.  This is not pink.  It is purple.  There is nothing pink about it.  So, that worked out well for me.On to the rest of the review...While my son seems to enjoy the TAG Reader, I truly don't think it will do a thing to help him learn to read.  The functionality is pretty much the same as on the old Leap Pads.  You point to text and it reads it or you point to little icons to play games.  It is nice that you don't have to haul around a bulky Leap Pad and there isn't any of that ""touch the green go circle"" garbage, but it seems like LeapFrog just remade a 10 year old item.  But, it does seem to entertain my son and that, after all, is what I got it for so I am completely happy with it."
My five year old daughter loves this toy. It is very easy to use. You do have to download the books on to the pen. It can hold up to ten books. We have the eye spy book and it is very fun. Since Christmas she has played with these several time. I am hoping that I can find some othe fun books for her to play with.
This device works surprisingly well.  You just point it at some text and the pen reads it aloud.  It's freaky cool technology, really.  My question is what's the purpose?  I guess it's to give early readers a hint as to what the text says?  Or perhaps for non-readers to enjoy a reading experience without adult supervision?  It's a very neat solution to a problem we haven't encountered yet.The software installs easily on your computer and doesn't require any real computer expertise.  If you feel this product would benefit your child, I'd certainly recommend it.
I got the original 16MB version of Tag and overall I'm rather disappointed. The Tag itself is an interesting piece of technology: it embeds an optical scanner and the special Tag books are printed with patterned backgrounds developed by a Swedish company called Anoto.  The books are interesting, but they are very thin (in size and content) and rather expensive.  So in order to take advantage of Tag, you must buy the additional titles, which can set you back a lot of money very quickly, as each sells for $14 or so -- say you buy 6 books, which will probably keep your kid occupied for a couple weeks, and you're out $84 before tax and shipping.The worst part of the Tag is the software which you must download from LeapFrog's website. The software, called LeapFrog connect, is poorly written and often has trouble connecting to my Tag, even though I have a new computer with tons of memory and a quad-core Intel processor and the fastest and most reliable USB ports and driver I've ever used. (I have 10 active-duty PCs at home and I support my family friends' computers.)  It's quite frustrating to use.I don't think I would recommend Tag to most families.  Like printers, the additional purchases are necessary and expensive, and the educational value is limited.  It's just not a good investment for your kids, unless you have more three or more who can share one in which case maybe it's worth considering.
"We've been looking at a few of these reader ""pens"" for a while, and thankfully had the chance to try out the Tag Reader before we made a purchase. I've compared the alternatives and although it's the most expensive, Tag seems to be the best quality. You get what you pay for, right? The Tag requires that you download the audio for each book or game you purchase. Some people don't like this, but I for one love not having to keep track of little cartridges. We've had those types of products (Fisher Price's Power Touch and LeapFrog's earlier Leappads) and yes, even if there is a special slot to keep the cartridges, they will still get lost! You can store the audio for 10 books and/or games on the Tag. In a perfect world, it would be able to store every book in their library. I'm sure they could squeeze much more than 32mb into the readers.But I'm nitpicking. Despite the lack of storage, the Tag works flawlessly. It is very responsive and accurate, and unlike other books for these readers, the pages aren't super thick and hard to turn. To the untrained eye, they just look like regular books. They are hardcover with lovely, smooth pages. Just a light touch is enough to get a response. There are lots of opportunity for clicking around each page to discover something new. Some of the pages have games, which are sometimes gimmicky but still educational. All of the pages have a variety of ways to read the book. You can choose to have the page read to you in it's entirety, or you can slowly move the pen over each word and it will read them that way. You can switch the mode and scroll across each word to have it sounded out as well. My 5-year-old was immediately engaged and plays with his Tag every day. He is just starting to read and this has fueled his interest in learning without him even realizing it.Downloading the audio is very simple. If you have other LeapFrog electronics, you probably already have LeapFrog connect installed. If not, plugging the reader into your computer will guide you. Easy stuff. You can download the audio for as many books as you like as they are stored on your hard drive. When you want to put the audio for books onto the reader, its as simple as checking off the ones you want and clicking the sync button. It will let you know when it's done (it is very quick) and voila. Ready to play. The USB cable is a standard micro connector so if you lose it, you're not out of luck. You probably even have another one lying around. If not, they're sold everywhere. I get irritated with companies who invent their own little plugs just to make you dependent on them for replacements! When you want to switch out the audio for new books, you just plug it in, it will load the software automatically (much like an iPod or iPhone) and you can again choose which ones you want and you're done. Even the computer illiterate can handle this.We only have two books and the US map right now, but we are definitely going to pick up more. My only gripe other than the limited storage is the hefty price of the books. It's a bit steep, but if you keep an eye on local ads or are signed up with the LeapFrog newsletter, you'll find them on sale once in a while. This is why the Tag gets 4 stars instead of 5. Overall though, a great tool to have when your little ones are ready to start learning to read. :)"
"My 3 1/2 year-old daughter is interested in learning how to read, and she would be content if I just sat and read books to her all day long. I, on the other hand, occasionally need to do things like shower, cook, or answer the phone. So she now happily sits and ""reads"" with her Tag pen.I was happy to find that the pen tip is sensitive enough that it's not hard at all for her to use and press on the right things, as long as she remembers to keep the book down flat. There's a lot on each page to activate-- sounds, words, and games. The size of this Tag pen works fine for her, and after some initial guidance, she is able to use it by herself. She doesn't yet have the patience or coordination to have the pen read the words one at a time, but she likes having it read a page at a time to her, then she explores the various sounds around the page and plays the games.Two small complaints about the design: one is that my daughter fairly frequently accidentally shuts it off by bumping into the ""off"" switch, and the other is that the ""hinge"" to open to plug in a USB cable is cheaply made, so the little door doesn't stay closed properly once you've opened it a few times.I know that some reviewers like the sample book that's enclosed, but I didn't-- because it really meant that the ""system"" was unusable right out of the box, because there was no book for my daughter to read. She read the two pages of Toy Story and wanted to know what happened next... she was not happy that the story abruptly stopped and then there were random pages from other books. So of course, I then had to go right out and buy the Toy Story book (nice going, LeapFrog). The books are very expensive, which is why I'm taking off a star from this system. It can become a very expensive habit! Of course kids will want several books, which means that this system will wind up costing triple-digits. While I think it's a very good toy, it is still a toy, and my daughter isn't going to keep reading and rereading the same books over and over, so it feels like a lot of money to me for what it is."
I was excited to get this for my first child, but at the age of 3, he doesn't yet have the attention span for it--plus, honestly, he's spoiled by the iPad so this isn't very exciting to him. Also, when I selected it from Vine, I hadn't realized you would have to download software and upload each purchased book. And maybe MY attention span is lacking as well, because I couldn't even figure out how to use it without the instructions (never a good sign to me). I'll keep trying it with my son in case his interest changes, but in the meantime, I'm glad I didn't spend money on it.
"I was reluctant to get this for my two boys, 3 and 4 1/2, after reading several less than stellar reviews.  I decided to bite the bullet and try it out after watching several youtube videos reviewing it.  I have to say that my kids and I love it!  The initial set up was kind of annoying, but as long as you have a good internet connection, the downloading of books and software isn't that big of a deal.  Once downloaded, my kids took off.  Even my 3 year old enjoys playing with it.  He doesn't ""read"" as much as push the games that are on nearly every page, but my 4 year old reads and plays the games.The only negative complaint I have about this product is the amount of memory storage.  I think it can hold 10 books, which is pretty good, but the product line has A TON of books and games.  I know eventually I will have to take things off to accommodate for more books.As far as battery life, I can't say just yet.  My kids have had it almost a week and are still going strong, but time will tell.  I monitor their use, so I am always aware of when they stop playing so that I can remind them to turn it off.  They are now remembering to turn it off as soon as they are done, and I am sure this helps the battery life.If you don't like downloading software or you have little or no internet connection, don't get this product.  If you aren't scared of a little bit of software and have a strong internet connection, your children will most likely enjoy this fun, educational toy."
This is a very nice way for little ones to learn how to read at a young age. This is a lot easier than the method I used when I taught myself how to read at the age of 4 by sounding out each letter in every word. The kids I had using this really enjoyed it very much and were reading the book on their own in no time. It's cute and engaging and I like that it has subjects that really appeal to kids instead of just generic stories. My only complaint is how expensive it is for the books to use this with. Otherwise it's great.
My 4 yo likes this Tag pen.  You should plan on getting some books when you get the pen because the included introduction book is really just a demo book with limited content.  At first my boy just poked around with the pen to hear different sounds but later started working on the educational stuff and seems to enjoy the immediate feeling of success when he gets stuff right.  The books are definitely overpriced at around $10+ each.  Sort of the shaving razor selling strategy.  You can get the pen (razor) cheap but, if you want to use it you need to pay a lot for the books (blades).  Even though the kids want the movie/TV themed books I think the educational value is better in the leap character ones.  They are also cheaper.  If your kid really gets in to this thing plan on spending an easy $100 for all the books they are going to want.
"My kids are really enjoying letters and words right now, and the TAG is a great way for them to explore those things.  There is the fun ""game"" factor, in that they can do matching things, and the I Spy book is a lot of fun for them.  We bought the actual book after checking out the demo in the book that is included.  That included book has a page each of various other books, so you can get a taster of the different functions of the TAG.The color is not at all pink.  I would say it's a purple that skews toward magenta.  That's fine.  But it isn't pink.The setup is not particularly easy.  My husband is a bigtime techie and it took him quite some time to get it set up properly.  The item comes with a USB cable to hook to the computer, but he had trouble getting the programs to sync correctly, as it for some reason refused to recognize the program he already had installed.  It worked just fine, but he had to uninstall and reinstall it to get the TAG to recognize it.  In the end he got it set up.This version holds 10 books, which is good enough.  There aren't all that many books made, so 10 will keep my kids busy probably until they are ready to read real books all on their own.Overall, we like the TAG and recommend it for preschoolers."
"Short version:The good: The pen is amazing, a real marvel of teaching technology.  The kids like it.The bad:  It's the most techno-savvy leapfrog product yet.  The pen needs to be connected to the computer a lot as your child learns.  Not only do you have to ""download"" the books onto the pen, but there is a feedback loop where the child earns rewards.  Most of the ""rewards"" require printer paper and ink.  I wish you could turn off the pen's requests to be plugged back into the computer, but you can't.Should you buy it:If you are used to performing regular ""maintenance"" with your ipod, and you don't mind that, then definitely buy it.If you don't like maintainin computers (firmware upgrades, syncing, troubleshooting, etc) then consider very carefully before buying.Don't get this as a gift for a person who either doesn't have a computer, or has a relic of a computer that they never use.Long version:I have owned a lot of leapfrog toys.  This is the first one I've used which is very similar to owning an ipod.Upon receiving this product, the pen comes with a demo book.  The demo book works out of the box, of course.  The technology itself is cool, there is a little camera underneath the pen point and it can ""see"" where you are on the page.  Touching the pen to the page makes the pen announce whatever is in that location.  You can switch ""modes"" by touching in the corner of the book.  For example, you can switch to ""play a game"" or you can ""read"".The demo book is fine for maybe a couple hours play, but it doesn't have enough play value for you to be satisfied with the demo book alone.  You're going to have to buy more books, which you expect if you have some experience with these leapfrog devices.So I bought several books to test this out with.  They included:LeapFrog Tag Activity Storybook I SPY Imagine That!,LeapFrog Tag Learn to Read Phonics Book Series Short Vowels, andLeapFrog Tag Learn to Read Phonics Book Series Long Vowels, Silent E and Y.  I waited to post my review until those items arrived.It was only after I received these books that I realized what it was like to use this product.  Here is my journey, in steps:STEP 1: I had to install Leapfrog software on my computer.  And each time you buy a book you have use your computer to ""install"" that book on the pen.  You can't go to a store and pick up a Leapfrog book and use it right away.  You either have to download the audio ahead of time (more on that in a minute) or come home and download it after you buy the book.  This IS NOT a cartridge system, like many previous leapfrog products.STEP 2: I had to set up a leapfrog,com ACCOUNT with a username and password.  I didn't appreciate the need to set up an account.  I am receiving occasional rare email solicitations from Leapfrog now, even though I indicated that I didn't want any emails.STEP 3: I had to set up each CHILD in the account.  You do this to track their progress.  I actually don't care about that very much, and I would have appreciated an opt-out on that feature.  So each child has a little account of their own.STEP 4: After I installed the software I plugged the pen into my computer with a USB cable.STEP 5: Then I had to update the software on the pen. (Thats ""firmware"" to us geeks).  Thats right, Leapfrog felt the need to change the software that makes the pen work between the time the pen was made and the time you bought it.  So bringing the pen ""up to date"" is your responsibility.STEP 6: Then I had to find the books I bought (one at a time, even though they aren't sold separately) for download from leapfrog's website.  You can download every book they have, even if you don't own the paper version of the book.  You could download the audio for a book, and then go to the store and buy the paper version, and then use the paper book immediately.  This was kind of nice if you are planning ahead.I hope you see what i'm saying - to use any book you need to have (1) a paper book and (2) a digital download for that same paper book which you got on your computer.  If you only have one or the other, you can't use that book.STEP 7: Next I had to use the computer program to move the books I wanted to use onto the pen.  This is called ""synchronizing"".  Fortunately, all 12 fit on the pen at one time.  You'd have to buy a lot of books before you filled up the pen (maybe 20?).STEP 8: I had to hit a button telling it to Sync.STEP 9: Then I unplugged the unit to let my child play with it.STEP 10:  (the unexpected step!) The toy instructs my child that she has won a reward!  And to plug it back into the computer to claim the reward!  The reward is a color bookmark for me to print out on my printer!  In 1 book (the I spy) she earned all four rewards in an hour.  Each time she stopped what she was doing and came to me to plug it in, view the reward, and print it out.  The first time, the software said I didn't own the book (which was funny because I had downloaded it using the same software) but after restarting it, restarting the pen, and resyncing the pen to the software it finally agreed that I did, in fact, own the book and could redeem the reward.  Personally, I didn't like step 10 very much, I was done at step 9, but modern technology is demanding.Will you (as a parent) like this experience?1) Obviously, if you one of the millions of people who are used to having your iphone, ipod, or whatver, you are used to all of this.  You get to do it all again when you buy this device.2) If you are one of the millions of people to whom this sounds like a pain in the [...] and makes you want to call your son in law, then, maybe, just maybe, this product is not for you.As for the product:The product is really quite good.  Its amazing what it can do.  And the kids really love to use it.  It will help them to learn to read, spell, and some other things too.  I'm very pleased with the product overall.It has a headphone jack, but no headphones are included.  My kids prefer over-the-ear headphones because those little earbuds just keep falling out.  We use these:Sennheiser  HD 202 Dynamic Supra-Aural HeadphonesThe demo book that comes with it is just ok.  Being optomistic, its worth 2 hour of fun.  Its got a huge variety of stuff.  Its almost too random an assortment, but it does show you what the pen can do.  They had to include something.  But the demo book is not very ""deep"".  You absolutely will have to buy more books.  The books range from $10-$20 each.  They can be used without the pen in a pinch.  I think the books are a ""fair"" value.The instructions were ""clear enough"".  They are good considering how much more software is involved.  I felt comfortable with the instructions and had no problems getting it set up.  I'm complaining about how much ""setting up"" there was, but, it wasn't ""hard"".Overall, to enjoy this product you are looking at a total expense of around $100 between the reader and a reasonable assortment of books.  And its really cool and really fun once you look past the other details."
"I got this TAG Reading System through the Amazon Vine program to review.  I was very excited to get it because my son (who is 3.5 years old) was showing interest in this and we were trying to decide whether or not to invest in it.  It is a great learning tool and lots of fun for him.Let's start with the only complaint I have with this reading system.  That is that this doesn't actually comes with any TAG books.  It comes with a sampler book that includes a page or two from a variety of different books.  My son found this frustrating and so did I.  We immediately had to go out and buy some books to use with it.  So, you were warned.  Make sure to order a couple books when you buy this.Now on to all of the wonderful things.  The books include games and a number of different reading modes.  You can touch the words to hear them read, you can touch a purple star to have the whole book read to you, and you can touch the pictures to hear about them. This is wonderful because it kind of grows with your child.  At 3.5 years old my son is a bit young for some of the games; but he loves listening to the story (like a newer version of those old tape books) and loves touching the pictures.This also has a lot of other neat features.  You can hook it up to the computer to see what games your child has played and how they are doing.  It helps you see what areas they need help with.  They also have awards that your child can get; these can be printed out and are kind of fun.  You win bonus games and stuff as you finish game levels in the book.  So outside of just being a reading tool there is a lot of other stuff to do with this.On other thing to mention is that you need to download the audio files to the TAG Reader when you get a new book.  This is something we didn't know right off.  My son was very disappointed that he couldn't play with it right out of the box.  But, well, once you get the software set up it only takes a couple minutes to transfer the audio files to the TAG.So far the TAG has been very sturdy and resilient and the battery lasts a long time.  This thing has been walked on and dropped numerous times and is still working great.Overall a definite winner.  My son plays with it all of the time, loves it, and seems to be learning from it.  He loves that he can ""read"" books to himself and doesn't always have to depend on mom and dad to do it for him.  I highly recommend this, especially for preschoolers."
I'm one of those moms that doesn't have a tv in her house.  No, not primarily for my kids.  But because DH and I would do nothing but drool all over it every night and be brain dead.  As it is, I find that I spend far too much time staring at another screen--the computer screen.  My iPhone would be a close second.  And I can already see how this is influencing my daughter's preferences in spending her time.  She begs for my smartphone too.  I struggle with how much I should use it.  Since she has autism, (though this is relevant for all kids), there were many times that the phone saved me while I was doing necessary errands--going to the grocery with her, sitting at the DMV, waiting for a very late doctor's appointment, etc.  Sometimes I convince myself that it's educational b/c I have math or handwriting apps, or that I've seen her fine motor skills improve (something her occupational therapist can attest to).  However, sometimes it's a glorified electronic babysitter.  And, you know, sometimes that's ok too.Well, I kinda feel the same way about the TAG leapfrog reading system.  It's likely a step above television and the laptop.  I'm not sure that it's better than a smartphone.  Research has shown that kids need real interaction in order to learn.  I'm not entirely convinced that the reading pen does that for them.  I'll admit though, that I have a daughter who is hyperlexic (overly obsessed with letters and words) and that reading came naturally to her despite my not encouraging it (other than regularly reading to her).  Perhaps for a kid who is really interested in reading, but has some developmental gap in putting the phonics together or just making that last connection to full-blown reading, or even for the child who is reading but has a hard time with difficult words, this pen would be amazing.  But I just found that for my own daughter, she got much more pleasure out of interactive reading or, if she was reading on her own, she made much more progress when she was challenged by the words (and had to get up and ask me about what they were) rather than having some device just giving her all the answers.  Then again, the pen can function as a glorified electronic babysitter, and sometimes, that's ok too.  I guess I would recommend the product....in moderation.
I bought my LeapFrog Tag 'Pen' years ago when my first child was showing interest in perusing books on her own. She loved to sit in the back seat of the car on trips, using her pen to read a story or find new things in her books to explore. When she got older, we bought her the packets of animal fact cards to use with the pen and she loved that, too.Now my youngest is starting to read and discovered the LeapFrog Tag. He is in love with it much like his sister was. He reads the books, touches the illustrations to reveal sounds and more facts. He loves the cards and just recently, we purchased the space kit with the board and stickers and such. That was a big hit with BOTH of them, even though my daughter is 9 now.I don't mind the downloading of book information, the software is very easy to use even on my Mac. We have the carrying case that keeps it all in one small space and well organized.
The shelf life of Tag reader is a short (2 to 3 years) but our six year old does still use it from time to time.  I state this because the 40 that you for the reader and the 10 to 12 dollars per book adds up quickly. The six year  old prefers small chapter books now. Thankfully we will be able continue to use the reader with our younger child.I do like that leapfrog has increased the storage of the tag reader; however, the up to 10 books is still not enough for us. Yes it is a big improvement over the 4 book version because we were connecting the reader to computer more often to swtich out the books.As far as making it easier for smaller hands to hold that leapfrog claims.  While the new reader is a little smaller there is not enough diffference at the point of the tag reader for it to be any easier for smaller hands.Educational and Entertainment is where the tag reader excels.  The reader is a good compliment to a good phonics program.  Definitely not a replacement The books do contain a few bigger words that your kids will not see in their sight word training, so the tag reader gets the child through those words without the frustration that comes with learning to read.The reward part may be the best thing to the kid because they get excited when the complete the book and receive a reward once you connect the reader to the computer.I would definitely recommend the tag reader to friends and family.I gave it four stars because the storage is still not enough and the smaller hands claim is overblown.
I first purchased the TAG Reading System about 2 years ago for my then 5 and a half year old son.  He absolutely LOVED it.  We purchased just about every book available for the TAG reading system.  His favorites were the Dinosaur one and the Spongebob one.  It was really easy to register the reader, download the books and then use it.  Please note:  A computer is needed in order to download the books onto the TAG reader via a USB connection.  This newer version TAG reader holds about 10 books.  The older one only held about 5, if I remember correctly.  All of the books we downloaded, along with the TAG reader, fit nicely in the TAG carrying case (which is NOT included with this set).  I personally think I waited a little late to buy it for my first son, so with my second son, we started him at around 3.  It helped that his big brother showed him how to use it.) Again, it is easy enough for a 3 year old to use.  You/your child can easily switch between read word by word mode or whole story mode.  Some of the other pen readers only read the whole page.  You cannot click on one word and it tell you JUST that word.  A really great tool for learning to read!  It is also a perfect toy for those long road trips.  Highly recommend!
The LeapFrog TAG Reading System is a great toy and much more. Every parent with children between the ages of 3-6 should consider to introduce their children to reading. It is very simple to use and a child can learn to use very quickly. It is a great learning tool and set-up is very easy. This is something I wish I had when I started to learn to read.
This fun little device is a great way to get your kids more involved in building their reading and vocabulary skills and participate in other reading activities based on some of their favorite movies and tv shows.The small hand-held `pen' emits words or sounds or reads when placed at various places on the pages of the book - it could be reading a story, learning sounds, or finding items in an `I Spy' game or solving small puzzles.  The sound is great - clear and easy to understand.  The books are nice and colorful and not too big - the books and pen are very portable which is great.It would have been nice if they had included an actual entire book with the pen, rather than just a `sampler' book, but c'est la vie.  There are a nice variety of books to choose from when ordering, a great selection for both boys and girls (and maybe even a few adults - I rather enjoy playing the I Spy games with my daughter).I like that you can connect the pen to the computer to keep track of your childs activity and collect little rewards for them.  On the flip side I don't like  that you have to connect to the computer to download something for every book that you purchase - and the pen will only hold downloads for up to 10 books.  This can be a pain, but we'll work around it and keep 10 books in the pen for a while until she gets tired of them, and then rotate them for some new ones.Overall I definitely recommend this as a great way to boost your child's interest in reading and learning - it's really great as an `on-the-go' activity to keep them busy in the car or waiting at the doctor's office or something like that.
"Like the Wii controller, the TAG pen has an infrared camera built into its tip.  However, it uses it for a very different purpose.  By recognizing dots printed on TAG books, it knows just where you've pushed the pen down.  I should note here that it's not really a pen, but a large stylus that detects when it is pressed on something.  This is primarily used for words.  Pressing a word can cause the pen to say the word, or, if put on a different setting, to say the letter or the sound of the letter.  This means that kids can ""read"" without knowing how, and pick up on common words and sounds over time.  Images can also be pressed (a frog ribbits, etc.).  It is a lot of fun!The pen itself is bulky, but I imagine this is to prevent it from being a choking hazard.  I expect it to be durable, as Leapfrog products generally are.  Before using a book, you need to download the program for that book to the pen, which can be done with a PC or Mac.  These are not just audio files.  The pen can actually do some basic processing to allow games.  For example, a game might ask a child to find a certain object or word.  This is really slick and feels strangely futuristic for a child's toy.If you have experience with Leapfrog, you know that these sorts of things can be huge money sinks over time.  It is almost scary to purchase.  I know that I will probably spend quite a bit on books now!  Regardless, this is a really cool gadget that is actually educational, so I think it is money well spend compared to other toys.  I would also say that it is far better than the questionable videogame systems they have, which are durable, but feature technology that is worse than I had in videogames as a child and often low quality software."
My 5-year old daughter and my 3-year old son love the Leap Frog Tag Reading System.  As a mom, I often buy educational toys only to have my children toss them aside because they are not fun - but this is not at all the case with the Tag.  My children play with this toy for hours and they learn so much.  In the sample book that comes in the package there is an activity in which children have to identify specific countries in Africa - to my suprise, after about an hour, my children were naming countries in Africa and having FUN doing it!  Tag is also helping them to read.  On each page of the Tag books there is an icon that you can touch the pen to that reads the page for you - or, you can also touch the tag to the individual words and it will read it as well.  This is a great toy for around the house, in the car, pretty much anywhere - we even bring it on walks and it keeps the kids entertained so they don't complain.  Definately purchase this toy if you are interested - you will be glad that you did!
We are a family very fond of Leapfrog products.  This reader is great because it helps build a positive and fun reading experience for young and new readers.  This is something they can do independently and helps to build their confidence in reading.  There a plenty of games that are linked to the books which my child thought was super fun.  The battery life is pretty good so far.  The Leapster we have sucks batteries like crazy!  The books available are a little pricey but there are lots of variety to choose from.
All children love being read to and that is very important for their development of language skills and to encourage them to want to read.  As they begin to learn to read, they are limited in their books for a while due to their vocabulary being small.This system allows them to read along, at their own pace and when they want, with more complicated and more interesting books.  It is fabulous and allows them to book shop long before they can read above the Bob Books range, since LeapFrog has quite a large assortment of books to choose from.There is a bit of computer time involved with downloading audio and updating accounts.  But, having done Leappads, we are used to that.  I can see a lot more shopping for books for these in my future.
I received this item free through the Amazon Vine Program for my child and did not find it appealing.  Granted, I did not spend much time with it, but it appeared to read only highlighted words in the text.  Perhaps my child is too young to find this enjoyable, but we decided my reading to her was far more enjoyable and interactive.
"Never having used a Leapfrog with the kids, I was excited to try this out! The educational value of it, with the help with reading and the games/activities embedded into the pages is exceptional. It makes reading fun, which is incredibly important in those active kids that don't want to sit still OR the kids that are really into technology and think that books are boring. Leapfrog is a great introduction to reading and for that, the educational level gets a definite 5 for me!The ease of setup was surprising as well. The software installation was a piece of cake and we were able to use the system just a few minutes after starting. Definitely a plus for a ""slow-learner"" when it comes to technology like me!Though we haven't used it long enough for me to state that the Leapfrog system does indeed help with learning, it has held the attention of my nephew for over 30 minutes at a time and he repeatedly tells us that he ""loves to read!"" He's working on it for sure and I know that the Leapfrog and its techno aspects were a huge help.I do wish there was some sort of protective case or sleeve for the product, but so far it's survived being dropped and tossed around, so that speaks highly of durability. I also really wish that some actual books came with the system, rather than just a sampling. For the price, at least one book should be included."
I've had similar items like this before that never really held up to the promise.  I always had problems with those but this item has been flawless so far.  It works great and it's very easy to use.  It's a piece of cake to get started and once you get started you don't want to quit.  I'm really impressed with how easily it reads the words.  The speakers are nice too, not robotic.  I found the spelling and the sounding out of words to be great features of this item.  I think the variety of books that are available are great.  Games, activities, maps & storybooks.  A great mix.  I would highly recommend this great learning tool.
"I think this is a great learning toy for young children who are learning their alphabet, learning to spell, learning to read, etc.  It would also be great to take on road trips as some of the books play games, and it is a nice compact form of learning and entertainment.  The TAG pen itself has the ability to attach headphones, so it would be perfect for a plane ride as well!The pen is pretty easy to get going - you need an internet connection in order to download the content from the internet (if you don't have a cd with the content on it), then you just download the ""LeapFrog Connect"" software from LeapFrog.  Go to the parent tab, select the content you want on the pen, connect the pen via the usb connector and tell it to sync.  It was so easy to get going!  The program allows you to download any of the books to your child's TAG pen, and it also helps you to monitor how your child is doing by giving you progress reports.The basic LeapFrog TAG Reading System (this kit) comes with the TAG pen (this one is 32MB, which holds information for about 10 books), a normal usb connector (I think it is the same that will connect many media items like cameras, etc), and a short book/booklet (not hardback, not a complete story) that shows you what the pen can do and will entertain you and your child for quite a while.  The book looks like it has excerpts from many different books.  It demonstrates how the TAG pen can read the pages aloud, spell words, make letter sounds, say the letters, play games, give facts, help your child interact with the pictures on the page, etc.  I was really amazed at how many of the characters/items on the pages had content attached to them.  It was actually fun to try to find something that wouldn't make a noise or talk!I let my 3 1/2 year old son play with the TAG pen and booklet to see what he would do.  He loved it, learned a few new words, and laughed at some of the characters and the sounds they made.  He was really fascinated by the spelling/letter sounds feature and I think it really helped with his letter recognition.  I plan to get him some of the phonics books and a few fun books (what boy doesn't like Scooby Doo or Pirates??) for his upcoming birthday.PLEASE NOTE: You will need 2 AAA batteries.  AND  If you want to start with a complete book/story, make sure you pick up a book with the TAG system.  I was kind of disappointed that it didn't come with a complete story, so I ran down to a local store and purchased one so we could go through a real book."
My four year old was thrilled to get the TAG Reading System. It is a lot of fun for her. It took just a minute to set up using the computer and it was ready to go. It comes with a sample booklet that has single pages from several different stories such as Toy Story, Tinkerbell and Spiderman. When the pen touches a word, it will read the word. The pages also have games and activities to play aside from just the story. In its function, it reminds of the Little Touch Leappad we got about six years ago. Like the Little Touch though, you need to buy the books separately to work with the TAG Reading System, so it can get pricey if you want several stories. It makes me wonder if local libraries offer them for check out.As for teaching my child to read, I do not see how a pen that says the word for my daughter will help her learn to read at this age, but I suppose it will help her to recognize what is a word and what is not. As she gets older and reads some on her own, I think this will be a good learning tool if she needs help figuring out what a word is after trying on her own. If she does start to use it in such a manner, it will free me up to prepare dinner or throw in a load of laundry. I'm always looking for help in that respect. Overall, this is a fun and entertaining toy that does not take up much space. I'm glad to have it and I hope it will be educational for my child.
