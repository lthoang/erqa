Top review:
Apples to Apples, The Game of Hilarious Comparisons, is a card game that is fun to play with family or friends. It is recommended for 4 to 10 players and for ages 12 - adult.It is fast-paced and a game can be played in about  hour, depending on the pace of the players. As with many games, the more players, the more fun the game is because of the varied responses from players.The game itself consists of green cards which have the characteristics of a noun listed and the red cards which have a name of a noun listed. The red cards are dealt to each player and the judge (which rotates between players) picks a green card from the stack with a characteristic on it. Each player chooses a red card that matches the characteristic on the green card the closest and plays that card. The responses can vary wildly because you may or may not have a card that has anything to do with the green card. The card comparisons chosen by players can be hilarious. The judge chooses a card that he/she thinks matches the best. The green card is awarded to the player that played the winning card. The game is played until someone has enough green cards to win.The game is a real blast, great for get-togethers, family game night or just a rainy day inside. It is a good game for players of all types because it is basically a card game and does not require players to perform actions or tasks like many other games which shy or more reserved players do not feel comfortable doing.This game is designed for older players but there is a Junior Edition for players ages 9 and up.Highly recommend. Get yourself a box and have some fun, comparing Apples to Apples.

Questions:
where is it made?
Directions makes no sense The directions to this game makes no sense. Can anyone explain better? #3 says that after every player submits their card, the judge is suppose to mix the cards so no one knows who played which card. Then the judge read each card out loud and picks the card he/she thinks best describes the green card. The judge is suppose to award the player of the selected card with the green card. So how does the judge know which player picked which card if the cards were mixed?
Can you play with just 4 people?
Can't this be played with 2-3 players? I was looking for a family game, but our family is only 3 and sometimes only 2 of us have time to play.
does this game come in metal container?
How many people do you need to play?
what age group?
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
"This is an easy to play, easy to follow, party game for adults mainly (possibly older teens, but they probably won't want to be that open) that helps rekindle what I consider a dying trend. That trend is social interaction, chat, laughs, and open ended fun for small or large groups in a party setting. Not much really in the educational rating, but it's refreshing to find something that gets everyone involved, instead of simply sitting around watching a movie. I'm actually more a fan of the DVD based games like ""Shout about Movies"" which don't use cards like this, but still it's a winner. Depending on the crowd you have assembled (and the level of interaction) the game can be innocent fun or even downright bawdy in the interpretational aspects of gameplay. A small price to pay for something that gets people in a social setting doing what we were supposed to do (before TV and game consoles) talk, play and have fun. Enjoy!"
My family and I have enjoyed this game a few times in the past couple of weeks since we received it.  It was simple to learn and we were even able to include our 5 year old.  It is nice to have a game that the entire family can play and enjoy.  We were all laughing and having a great time especially after the first couple of times playing.There have been enough reviews explaining how the game works so I won't repeat that here.  I'd just like to say that I'm glad we got this game and I know it will be one that we turn to time and time again.  Like I said, it's easy to learn and if we have someone new joining us for game night, we don't have to spend a lot of time explaining it.  And, unlike a game like Monopoly, it doesn't take that long to play one game and nobody feels left out.  We just had fun playing and it didn't matter who won or lost.
This is a very stimulating game, interesting because it's rules are not what many would expect. And it is great to keep the kids' minds working and away from the tv.
"This is a great party game for a large, diverse group!  It's easy to get people involved - even people who normally avoid party games - because:*  The gameplay is very simple.  A quick description is enough to get everyone going.*  It's not intimidating - nobody ever looks ""dumb"" for not having the ""right"" answer, since there is no one right answer.*  It's fun!  People are laughing and enjoying themselves, which brings the nonplayers over to see what's going on.  It can get loud and silly.*  It's short - 30 minutes or so, so a new round occurs fairly frequently.*  It's easy to add another player (or swap players) mid-stream.This game is not designed for kids, but they can play with some modifications.  My 6 year old likes to partner up with an adult, who will explain the cultural references that he might not know yet.  It wouldn't be my first choice game for a group of primarily kids, but if there is a kid or two at an adult party they can be included."
"If you are looking for a game that is quick to set up and fun for adults and kids, this is it!Everyone takes turns being the ""judge"" and the judge picks a card which is the ""topic"" of that round. Say he or she picks the word ""shocking"" everyone looks through their hand of cards that they have been dealt and looks for the card that best describes the topic. Some cards have a word, some a phrase and some the name of a famous person.Everyone hands their card to the judge and the judge shuffles the cards then decides which one is the best. Some judges pick the funniest, or craziest or best one that defines the topic. Since each judge is different, you never know which card will win.I highly recommend this game."
"I understand that I am swimming against the tide here.  In the interest of full disclosure, I would rather play a game ofTroyes Board GameorMerkatorbefore pretty much any party game, but I also enjoy quality party games such asDixit,Balderdash, or evenCrappy Birthday.  Those party games at least encourage some level of creative thinking and strategy, and Dixit and Balderdash have elegant scoring mechanics which encourage a certain level of strategy.Apples to Apples has none of this.  The random card selection forces the players into prefabricated ""hilarious"" answers, and even taking the approach of playing one non sequitur answer after another can get rather tedious.  The totally arbitrary way in which the judge selects the winning card hardly helps.  It becomes impossible to formulate any coherent strategy.  Having people plead their case before the judge guarantees that the game either becomes a popularity contest or a situation where the loudest person in the room gets his/her way.There are better games out there, folks.  I have listed a few of them for your benefit.  Check them out.  It's a shame that a game as dull and uninspired as Apples to Apples has enjoyed the success that it has."
We've had a blast with this game. It's so easy to learn. You have seven word cards in your hand from the first deck, and you have to pick one that is best described by the card that is turned over from the second deck.  First, we played with my seven year old son and the neighborhood kids, and even though they didn't understand some of the words, they'd crack up when they'd see the other boys' choices.  We mixed the cards being played, then handed them to my husband, the judge, so he wouldn't know who's card was whose.  Next, we played it when we had some friends over for drinks.  This time, instead of the judge not knowing who the cards belonged to, we actually tried to talk our choice up so he would choose our card.  This quickly turned into a lot of silliness as we made our cases, and I think we ended up playing for over an hour before the kids came out and took over again.
Apples to Apples, The Game of Hilarious Comparisons, is a card game that is fun to play with family or friends. It is recommended for 4 to 10 players and for ages 12 - adult.It is fast-paced and a game can be played in about  hour, depending on the pace of the players. As with many games, the more players, the more fun the game is because of the varied responses from players.The game itself consists of green cards which have the characteristics of a noun listed and the red cards which have a name of a noun listed. The red cards are dealt to each player and the judge (which rotates between players) picks a green card from the stack with a characteristic on it. Each player chooses a red card that matches the characteristic on the green card the closest and plays that card. The responses can vary wildly because you may or may not have a card that has anything to do with the green card. The card comparisons chosen by players can be hilarious. The judge chooses a card that he/she thinks matches the best. The green card is awarded to the player that played the winning card. The game is played until someone has enough green cards to win.The game is a real blast, great for get-togethers, family game night or just a rainy day inside. It is a good game for players of all types because it is basically a card game and does not require players to perform actions or tasks like many other games which shy or more reserved players do not feel comfortable doing.This game is designed for older players but there is a Junior Edition for players ages 9 and up.Highly recommend. Get yourself a box and have some fun, comparing Apples to Apples.
Everytime we play this game we have a good time. Apples to Apples is a game of silly comparisons. It is similiarly played like Whonu. (our family prefers Whonu, so that's why this is only a four star)The judge flips the green card and you have a little mitful of red apple cards. You have to determine which red apple card is the most similiar to the green apple card. Which card fits best. The judge decides. SO the judge can pick you because your card is the funniest, or the closest or the strangest. You have to read your judges and that my friends is how good relationships can be made.This game really is a lot of fun, the junior version is just as wonderful as the adult version.
"We played this game when we had some friends and buddies come over.I can tell you that we all had a blast from the 13 year old to the 35 year old!It is a hilarious game of comparative and challenging rounds to see who can get the most green apples first.Each round you switch off being the judge, you draw a green apple card that has a category/description on it such as ""funny"" ""depressing"" or ""hilarious"" and other players (you are dealt 7 red apple cards) have to pick the best red one that they think best describes the green card that the judge pulled. Then the judge will read them aloud and choose who they will give the green apple card to.This is a great game to get to know people just a bit better and have a ball at the same time.If you buy this game you WILL NOT be disappointed!"
This is the only game people seemed to want to play at our house this year!  We have others but this one seems to be the one that gets used.  It is also the easiest to learn to play.  You can't argue with results.This game is good because ANYONE can play it.  You don't have to have special knowledge.  I think that is the appeal.  You don't have to be the smartest one in the room.  Young and old can play together.
This is a good family fun game.  Allows for fun and insight and uniqueness for each person.  I really enjoyed playing as a group for an afterdinner party.  Good game, not the best I have played, but not the worst either.  Good clean fun.
If you have 4-10 people available to you who are willing to play this game, it is perfect. This game is hilarious, and, if taken seriously, could potentially be a vocabulary enhancer. More than anything though, it is entertaining and intriguing.The game's only downfall is that it requires the participation of many people. That is why it is an excellent party game, not a two-player classic like monopoly or checkers. You need a lot of players to make gameplay worthwhile.Overall, it is EXCELLENT and I would encourage anybody to buy it.
This game is a good one for family members to get together to play while waiting for Thanksgiving dinner to cook! It inspires good conversation, laughter, fun, and is a great way to bring a group together to bond over the holidays. There's not a whole lot I can say about the game that has not already been said, as I see some wonderful reviews here that are in great depth. But I would just say this is one to keep handy for when the relatives come (or friends of course), for gatherings where you have a good size group to play for a while. I didn't quite enjoy this game as much as Scattergories, but it's still quite fun in it's own right. I find that with games like this, a larger group is always best (probably 5+ people). Aside from the holidays, I typically do not entertain that large of a group, hence the suggestions for playing it at those times. So, grab some hot cocoa, gather around the fireplace, and compare Apples to Apples!
We decided to try this game out after the kids went to bed for Halloween this year. Needless to say, it was a fun time by all!Pros:1. Quick Fun, not much learning curve.2. Quick Thinking game, so keeps you on your toes.3. Fun Fun Fun, you will get many a laugh out of it.4. Everyone gets involved, which is good!Cons:1. Needs at least 4 to play, preferably 5-62. Thats it, get this game!
"What's nice about this game is that you can start playing it very quickly. A lot of games tame set up and break down time but this one is pretty quick. Plus the games don't have to last very long. My daughters love showing how clever they are by matching word matches and they love when its their turn to be ""judge.""Highly recommended for parents with young kids say between 10-15. A nice addition to family gaming night."
This game is a real fun to play and is a treat for the whole family.Little mind stimulation never hurts when you are having fun also.You have to be careful to keep the cards away from the younger kids below the age of 8, as they want a piece of it too.
"...and it wasn't even my set. I had the pleasure of playing Apples to Apples at a friend's home where it was the post-Thanksgiving dinner entertainment (oddly enough, I was planning to bring my copy with the intention of proposing a game so that I could finally review it, but I forgot to bring it). And I must say, I was pleasantly surprised at just how much fun this was (despite my lousy cards).I'm sure that everyone and their mother has cited the rules for play in their reviews, so rather than contribute to the redundancy, I'll try to focus on why this game is fun. For one thing, the learning curve isn't at all steep--a definite plus if ""liquid cheer"" plays a part in your festivities in general. And while some savvy is required to distinguish your comparisons from those of the other players, actual skill is not; getting good nouns that'll work with the adjectives really IS the luck of the draw (I remember silently cursing when I drew ""Joan of Arc"" immediately AFTER ""hot"" had been played).The real fun, though, is due to the fact that the probability of holding cards that really dovetail with the adjectives thrown down is pretty slim, hence some creativity is called into play. And trust me, it can get hilarious. One particularly funny moment occurred when a Russian friend's card had been chosen for the point and she responded by confessing that she wasn't sure of the meaning of the word on her card. Okay...I guess you had to be there, but still, it was fun.I noticed that the game recommends a minimum age of 12, which seems about right to me. Unlike SET, my favorite card game, the Party Box isn't something that you'd want to play with young children because I can't imagine that most of them would get it (I noticed that there's a separate edition for kids). Once, they're older, however, this would make a great family game.Being something of a cynic, I had no idea that games like this were being manufactured--smart, fun, reasonably priced, and not played on a monitor. I wholeheartedly recommend Apples to Apples for non-racy adult party fun--let's show support for toy manufacturers who produce games such as this. I'm actually considering buying at least one of the add-ons, but I think there's plenty of fun to be had with this basic Party Box in the meantime."
I have always heard such great things about this game, so I couldn't wait to try it out.  Needless to say, we absolutely love it.The thing I want to add to the other glowing reviews is that though it says 12 and up, my 6 year old loves this game.  Simple adaptations make it easy for her to play and don't compromise the game too much.It actually has allowed us an excuse to sneak some vocabulary in, as she is always asking us what different words mean and half the fun is listening to her (often off the wall explanations) for why she chose certain things.Great game, we love it!
This game is great for larger groups of people. It's not much fun unless you have at least four people. The less you know each other the more fun it is. It a good way to break the ice at parties. You can really learn a lot about the way other people think, associate and relate concepts.It is also just as fun with family and friends. If you know each other really well it gives you a totally different game feel. You have more fun enforcing the rules and playing on each others calls.Great game that continues to bring fun to parties. Loses it's novelty with the same group of people after about 3 or 4 times you play it.
if you are looking for a great family night this is the game for you. There is no winning or loose, everyone will have a blasts in this game
If you have quite a few people and a lot of time, this would be a good game to play. There are no losers. Pretty funny stuff.But we are just too busy and also cannot scrape enough players to play this much. Oh well.
"In 2007 Mattel acquired the rights to Out Of The Box Corporation's  award winning Apples To Apples franchise.  Mattel's Apples To Apples Party Box Edition truly is a PARTY IN A BOX!  This game is great to play at parties with good friends or acqaintances.  Be aware that you will know more about your game partners and opponents after playing this game!  All you have to do is just open the box and deal the cards! Select the card from your hand that you think is best described by a card played by the judge. If the judge picks your card, you win that round. As you go around the table, everyone gets their chance to be the judge. Each round is filled with crazy and totally outrageous comparisons from a wide range of people, places, things and events in each other's lives.  Adults and kids 7 and up can play this game.Mattel also makes a cute wooden Apple Crate Version - http://www.amazon.com/Mattel-Apples-Party-Crate-Game/dp/B001DXF9ZO/ref=sr_1_20?ie=UTF8&s;=toys-and-games&qid;=1227198453&sr;=1-20a travel version of Apples To Apples  http://www.amazon.com/Apples-Travel-Go-Game/dp/B0014484FO/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&s;=toys-and-games&qid;=1227198453&sr;=1-19and a card expansion pack http://www.amazon.com/Mattel-Apples-Party-Box-Expansion/dp/B00123TIQ6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&s;=toys-and-games&qid;=1227198672&sr;=1-4Along with the Apples To Apples franchise, Mattel makes an Apples To Apples 7 Plus Kids Edition http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Apples-Kids-Plus-Comparisons/dp/B00112EJEY/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s;=toys-and-games&qid;=1227198672&sr;=1-3and also an Apples To Apples Junior Edition for kids 9 years and up.  http://www.amazon.com/Apples-Junior-Game-Crazy-Comparisons/dp/B00112CHD4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s;=toys-and-games&qid;=1227198672&sr;=1-2I think the two items above would ""a-peel"" to the younger generation.All in all a great party game that never gets old or boring!Happy Playing!"
"I'm a major fan of board games, and I was curious about Apples to Apples the first time I heard about it. After playing it a friend's house, I just had to add Apples to Apples to my collection.The game begins with each player being dealt a hand of cards with nouns on them, like ""plastic,"" ""Michael Jackson"" and ""underwear."" In each round one of the adjective cards, like ""scary"" or ""organic,"" is turned over on the table. Each player chooses which card in his or her hand best fits the adjective and passes it to the player who is the judge for that round. The judge chooses which noun card best fits the adjective, and the player who submitted that noun card gets to keep the adjective card. The player with the most adjective cards at the end wins.The main downside in Apples to Apples is that judging is subjective, so this might not be a good game for those who like games to be ""fair."" The upside to this is it doesn't matter who wins or loses--it's just so much fun to see the crazy connections people make! For example, ""scary"" could get the cards ""Michael Jackson"" or ""underpants."" No answer is right or wrong. Only the judge for that round can decide which is best.The other downside to Apples to Apples is that this is definitely a party game, which means you should have five to eight people to play. Less than that, and it isn't quite as much fun. With more than ten, I think it might be best to work in pairs, with each pair submitting two cards and working together to make a decision when it's their turn to judge. Otherwise, there's a good chance several individual players could win two adjective cards, and it could take forever before one player gets three cards, which is what happened when I played at a friend's house.All in all, I would say Apples to Apples is my fourth favorite party game--after Taboo, Hilarium and Outburst, but right before Shout About Movies, Pictionary and Cranium."
Perfect family games for all ages.  Even our preschoolers love to play. (We read their cards to them.)  A great word game you can play anywhere.  We often play the games at mealtimes.  Each game lasts about 20 minutes--perfect for the attention span of a busy family.
This is a great game.  It's not real cerebral, but it's funny so adults enjoy it and fun so older kids like it.  Three generations of my family play it and hilarity ensues.  No special talents are needed, so it's great for parties or family gatherings, or just for small groups of friends.  This game was recommended to me and I was not disappointed.
My kids got this game last year for Christmas and I just want to add that this is a perfect party game when you have family over. We all cracked up laughing while playing this game. Each person holds cards in their hands and the lead person puts a card down. Everyone else is supposed to have something in common with what the lead person's card says that has been laid on the table. The only thing is, sometimes the cards you hold have nothing to do with what the lead card says, so it's totally opposite, and crazy. It's funny what each person can come up with. Each person takes turns being the lead card holder. This game has been a family favorite ever since. This game came highly recommended by my sister's kids, when my own children got it for Christmas last year, that just made them so happy. We highly recommend you play this, it'll become your family's favorite game too.
"Upon opening the box, I looked for the game ""board"" without success. It was then that I discovered how simple the game setup is. There are just two types of cards--no buzzer, no dice, no spinners, no hour glass timers--just cards. What I thought was funny, was as my friends and family sat down to play Apples to Apples, almost everyone had the same reaction--where was the ""stuff"". That is when it occurs to you that this isn't a normal game--which left it up the air as the question lingered--would it still be fun without all the stuff.The answer is yes. The beauty to this is that it *IS* simple and quick to get started and yet the lack of other items allows them to include a great deal more cards which provides much longer ""fresh"" game play. This really is the game plus an expansion pack or two bundled together, which makes it a good value. The fact that it is VERY fun makes it a GREAT VALUE. We have played the game way past the normal stopping point every single time because it is simply so much fun that no one wants to stop playing.I am not going to explain the game play because I think that has already been covered well, but this game is without a doubt worth picking up. One of the friends I played with already purchased her own copy because she fell in love with it. I expect the next week will include a lot of Apples to Apples fun as my family comes together for the holidays. So if you are looking for something different to play with a group of people, you have found it!"
