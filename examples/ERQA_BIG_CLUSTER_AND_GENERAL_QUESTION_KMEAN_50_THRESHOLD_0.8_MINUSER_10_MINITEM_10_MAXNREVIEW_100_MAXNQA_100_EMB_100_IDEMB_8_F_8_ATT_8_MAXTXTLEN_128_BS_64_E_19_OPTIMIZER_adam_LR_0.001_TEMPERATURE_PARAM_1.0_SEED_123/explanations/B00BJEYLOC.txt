"This is one of those toys that can provide HOURS of entertainment AND education. You're working those brain cells to build these railways! There's a booklet included with lots of different railways to build. It gives you step by step instructions by picture. You DO have to pay close attention to what color block you place where, and where the holes line up, and how many blocks you use. It all has to line up just right. That said, I wouldn't call this a difficult toy at all. It *will* exercise the mind, though.I like using it with my 5 year old. It's helping him to follow directions. Of course, I still have to help a great deal. It's also helping him with counting, which he struggles with. It's helping my 2 year old learn his colors. Plus, we're ALL learning patience! ;) These railways fall down pretty easily, since it's basically stacking blocks on top of each other. Honestly, for most 2-3 year olds, I think this thing probably isn't the best idea just yet. For older children, it's wonderful. It has potential to grow with them for *years* to come. This is fun for adults, too! I've had a blast with it.My ONLY complaint with this thing is the fact that the marbles have nothing to catch them as the come out of the final holes/blocks. They just roll away. We have a 7 month old that crawls everywhere and puts everything in his mouth. We're always careful, but playing with this thing, we have to be extraordinarily careful, especially due to the free rolling marble issue. So far, we haven't came up with a ""catching place"" for those last marbles, but I'm sure we will in time. We just can't use all the marbles at one time, and keep a close count on what we do use.The extra caution we have to use is WELL worth it, though!!This is the kind of toy you just can't go wrong with! (Unless you have children that might choke on those marbles...use your best judgment at that point). Highly recommended from us!"

Questions:
Does this have to be put together in one of the suggested configurations, or can a child just randomly create different patterns?
Would this be compatible with the "old school" style wooden marble runs that are simple blocks with holes and straight tracks?
How many spiral funnels come with this set? It's not clear from the description if it's one or three.
does it come with marbles?
Thinking about buying this for my son who is turning 8.  He he too old for this toy?
Can you buy different Hape Quadrilla sets & combine into a mega set?
Do the pieces "lock" together (like plastic marble runs)?
i would like to know how many pieces these has and if came with marrbles  thanks
I am having trouble using the large red piece. it doesn't move back and forth. Has anyone had success building runs including this?
What kind of batteries does it use?  Would this be good on an airplane? Or better to get the travel version?  what is size of this toy?  can you charge the ipad while it's in the case?  What is the difference between InnoTab 2 and InnoTab 2"s"  What is "Frustration Free Packaging"?  Do Baby Stella outfits fit these dolls?  How tall is it?  Can you turn the sound off?  do you have to have a i pad ?  Is there black chalk?  are the wheels plastic?  Do hot wheels cars work on this track?  how big is it?  Does this work with the ipad mini?  For what ages?  Can I order more balloons on Amazon to come with the game? How? Thanks!  does it come with any cargo cars or just Thomas engine?  are there any cargo cars you can buy separately that Thomas can pull?  does it use touch screen? 
Reviews:
"Wow did my kids love this toy! It's something of a kit, with a bunch of wooden pieces that be combined in any different way that you can think of, to make a nearly endless series of courses for the marbles to roll along. It comes with a booklet, which includes a series of step-by-step diagrams on building a number of intricate and fun ""marble railways.""Assembling the predesigned courses is a bit of a challenge, as the pieces in the pictures are quite small, and sometimes I actually picked the wrong one...resulting in some ""troubleshooting and critical thinking exercises."" Also, if someone designs a new course, they cannot really record it except with a camera - lettered or numbered pieces might have helped.But, once the railway is complete and working, the kids had a blast, rolling the marbles through it, and even working in teams to keep feeding the marbles through for a constant flow! Also, I must say that not a man walked past that didn't play with it for at least a little while. :-)So far, this toy is a big hit, and they can't wait until school is over, so they can get back to it!*****How much fun is this toy? 5 stars, definitely!How would you rate this toy's educational value? 5 stars - building, following directions, troubleshooting.How durable is this toy? 5 stars - even though the completed course is easy to push over (as we found out!), the tough little wooden pieces should be able to stand up to a lot of abuse.*****(Review of Quadrilla Vertigo from Hape)"
I love quality products, and this toy definitely fits the bill.  I have been looking at Quadrilla for a while now, mostly when I see it set up in stores and my kids play with it.  Mostly there they don't want you moving around what they have set up, though, so I wasn't sure if my kids were going to really understand how to follow the directions and set up their own.  My oldest is a pro at Legos, though, so I had a hunch he'd be up for it.When it arrived they couldn't wait to try it.  Couldn't even get it 5 feet from the front door and they were already setting it up.  They tried multiple runs, and liked them all.  They got a little annoyed when the marbles rolled around so much on our wood floors, going under furniture, but then they discovered they could put Tupperware lids at the bottom of the run and it would catch and hold their marbles. Problem solved!An absolute must for families wanting a relatively quiet toy, for kids really into making things structurally sound, and so beautifully made that this will be saved for my grandkids someday (along with the wooden train sets, Legos and Magnatiles).
"This is one of those toys that can provide HOURS of entertainment AND education. You're working those brain cells to build these railways! There's a booklet included with lots of different railways to build. It gives you step by step instructions by picture.

I love wooden toys because with three rough boys nothing plastic makes it more than a few days around here. However, wooden toys stand the test of time and aggressive play, ha! These are no exception. We have had similar models to these before and the boys love to build all types of marble creations with them. This one has been a great addition to our other sets. Like the others it is sturdy, colorful, and has different swirls and pieces that keep the boys building for hours. It's imagination & invention in one great product. It's like legos & wooden blocks, but adding elevation and marbles!
The Quadrilla marble runs are all really well made products.  They're all made out of wood which is a throwback to an earlier era.  I really enjoy that and knowing that my son is using something that is substantial.  There are enough pieces in this set to make multiple shapes and marble runs.  It's really a fun set and I expect it to be around in my house for a long, long time.That being said, right out of the box, my 5 year old got the hang of this pretty quickly.  He's got the Quadrilla starter set so he already had the idea of making towers and getting the ramps to line up.  It was pretty amazing to turn around and see what he'd make when I wasn't looking.That being said, my son is 5.  He really couldn't put much together when he was 4 or younger.  He didn't have the coordination or dexterity like he does know.  And I know that he's going to grow into this set even further.One other point that should be brought up with this set... Carpet.  Don't even bother trying to set this up on carpet.  It needs hard wood or tile.  Carpet won't give the set enough of a base for stability.This is an expensive set but should last and last and last.
"Our family has really enjoyed this ""marble railway.""As others have noted, it's a well built set as the solid wood railway pieces are nice and durable. The spiral railway pieces probably can't take a ton of weight, but they have no trouble handling the rough and tumble of normal play.The included plans and step-by-step instructions are varied and fun. If you can follow moderately complicated Lego plans, you'll be able to follow these. For kids that are too young to build the designs by themselves, they can work with you and help you find the needed pieces and such.We've discovered that it's helpful to test the railway as we build. Tower pieces often need to be adjusted, ramps need to be shifted, etc. I think letting our kids figure out what needs to be tweaked is one of the best learning aspects of this toy.It should be noted that the railways aren't terribly sturdy. We've found that we need to build on solid floors (not carpet), and we need to keep our 15-month-old away from our building efforts!"
This will be a fairly short review because there's really not a whole lot to say about this other than &#34;buy it.&#34; While the price may be something of a hurdle, it's well worth it. The construction is top notch, with everything cut from quality wood and finished nicely. THe various ways in which the set can be assmbled are also quite fun, with an instruction manual that provides 4-5 starting configurations, and others limited only to your imagination. The instructions themselves leave a bit to be desired, but if you pay attention, they're generally self-explanatory (in a few, the diagram proves to be incorrect, but it's usually fairly obvious what you need to do to make a correction). Once constructed, watching the marbles complete the course is an absolute blast. The set comes with 25-30 marbles, so you can get some pretty impressive marble &#34;trains&#34; going. The choices to have this marble go this way and that marble go that only add to the fun.The only real cons are that, once assembled, the set isn't exactly sturdy (a kid bumping one edge with a leg will knock the whole thing over), and it's really desgined more for hard floors than carpet (which only adds to the instability). You can certainly build structures on carpet that will work, but it'll require an extra bit of care to do so.All in all, I can't recommend this enough. The educational opportunies are extremely high, and it's a complete blast to play with. The cons, while important to know, are ultimately minor in the face of one of the coolest sets I've seen in years.PS No batteries required. That's hard to beat in the 21st century. ;)
Okay, this thing is way too much fun.  I wish I had gotten one of these a long time ago.  Everyone &#8211; kids and adults have had a good time playing with this.  And it&#8217;s so configurable I think it has real staying power.  Probably my main challenge is that the marbles are too small to have around my toddlers, so I&#8217;ve regulated this to a room where all the &#8220;older kid&#8221; toys go.  When my younger children get a little older they are going to have a blast with this.  My older kids (6 and 7) needed a little help getting started but now they can reconfigure it with ease.  It encourages a lot of natural thinking about physics and geometry.  It&#8217;s also been a great vehicle for cooperative family play.It&#8217;s really well made.  Nothing feels cheap about this at all.  This set comes with everything you will need, but I can already see that adding one more set might be a good idea.  I would much rather spend money on this than a video game.  This is just a great toy: every family should have one.
The quality of this set is spectacular. Each piece is perfectly crafted, expertly colored and completely functional. The colors serve as a guide to building with the included set up plans which makes it really easy for kids to pick the parts they need next.My 3 year old and I built this together. It took a long time but we had fun picking out the pieces and fitting them together. The most delightful finish was dropping the marbles onto the run. He loved it and spent a lot of time dropping them on and watching which way they traveled down the tracks.We built this on carpet and it was very sturdy. I liked building it on carpet because it meant the marble stopped when they came out of the run. On other flooring they would have rolled right away.An older child could create their own run. I think creative, curious kids could find this an entertaining toy for a decade.As an investment toy, I think this is a good place to put your money. The set is durable, customizable and endlessly entertaining. Bravo Hape!
My 8-year-old daughter gives this marble run a 3-star rating.  I would probably give it 3.5.  She enjoyed putting it together, but she had a few complaints.  On the plus side, it has a lot of colorful and attractive wooden parts.  The booklet has instructions for seven different tracks to build.  It comes with about 50 marbles, which the kids loved to use.On the negative side, my 4-year old son did not seem that interested in building with this set.  It falls apart too easily.  Even though the pieces are solid and well-crafted wooden pieces, they only rest on top of each other instead of fastening together.  Even gently bumping against it can cause it to partially collapse.  My kids still prefer our old plastic marble run (Marbleworks by Discovery Toys), which is sturdier and easier to construct.Overall, this is a beautiful and challenging toy that should provide many hours of family enjoyment, but kids may get more enjoyment out of a different style of marble run.
This toy is composed of sturdy wooden pieces, that you use to construct tracks for marbles, which are also included.  Pictures show how to construct the runs.  It is enough of a challenge to keep kids busy for long periods of time, as they make different patterns. It's really hard sometimes to find toys that don't need batteries or other additional purchases, so that is a big plus.  Although this toy is recommended for children as young as four, I would very strongly recommend that you are sure they or other children in the household are mature enough to not put them in their mouths.
My initial response to this toy is extremely positive.  My son LOVED this just from the box.  He seriously studied the box and declared that because there was a picture of four marbles together, you could put four marbles at a time on it!  (You can put more.)It's very solidly constructed out of wood, with lots of different colors.  Everything is sized properly for little hands to hold, but it's not very forgiving if you put a piece down at anything other than the exactly correct angle.  There are lots of bright colors as well.Most of the wooden pieces are constructed in multiple ways, so they can be used as a horizontal pass through, or as a slide.  There are a lot of lessons about mechanics going on here.  Some of the best pieces are designed so they don't function the same way each time!  Drop a ball in from the top, the marble first goes out to the left, but the next time it goes out to the right.  In addition to being visually interesting, that captures the kids' attention.There is also a pivoting piece that is awesome because it creates a flood of marbles, and again, there is a practical physics lesson there.The instructions have no words, just pictures, so it's possible for non readers to assemble (as well as saving the manufacturer from having to do translations).  It's a bit tough to distinguish the green from the aquamarine, but they're pretty much the same piece, as I eventually realized, so it's just cosmetic. The cool thing is that once you get the hang of it, you can construct your own.On the other hand, this is tough for households with little children, even if they're not the ones actually playing with the toy, because there are a lot of small pieces.  Marbles are horrific choking hazards.  Also, it's real easy for a little one to knock over something my older one has spent the last hour building.  Marbles are constantly going all over the place (because they fall off *and* because they have no marble catcher as part of the design).  I think I might try and use this with aLay-n-Go Lite, Green/Blueor similar to keep everything together.
This toy is way to cool. My kids have a plastic marble track with three simple swirls and that's it. They like it enough but we all love this one.This track is made of quality parts and they are non toxic.  The best part (no batteries) so you can play and play and play. If your thinking about giving this as a gift then you don't have to worry about buying anything in addition. The set also comes with a bag of 50 marbles so that's great.MY children who are 5 and 7 have no problem building this track on their own with no help. The runs are smooth and work great.The amount of pieces allows for almost endless possibilities.We bought a plastic tub to put everything in when the kids are done with it. The track once fully built can be pretty good sized so if you decide to set it up and leave it stationary you want to make sure its in a good sized room.Recommend ages are 4 to 15 so I can see this being around and being used for a very long time to come. Great product well worth the asking price, and sure to be a hit for the holidays.
Why is it that I can't wait for a blizzard this winter to bring this wonderful building set out again?  Okay, that's a lie. I can't put it away !  I absolutely LOVE the Quadrilla Mable Railway!  It's fun for the little ones, but let me tell you, I had teens building with it and sending marbles down the rails!  I am seriously considering buying another set for me add on fun!  I cannot think of one negative thing to say about this toy. It will make a wonderful family gift! Sit by the fire and enjoy some family time!
"My son, who adores puzzles, models and anything that has to do with construction, has long wanted one of these marble runs, so I was thrilled to be able to get this one via Amazon Vine. And, to be honest, now that we've got it, I'm even more excited, and would gladly have paid for it out of pocket.This is a high quality, HUGE set--my six-year-old built a run almost as tall as him--that really works well for a variety of ages (younger kids can do it with their parents). I'm expecting it will provide hours of educational and entertaining play time. There are ample pieces: straight runs, drops, funnels; all designed with smooth, high quality wood that feels smooth and sturdy in your hand. They fit together naturally and setting up a quick run to get the feel of it took only a few minutes from opening to sending a marble down the chute.After that, my son struck out on his own, first building one of the more elaborate example runs, and then just using his own imagination, building away for the better part of a weekend afternoon, always excited to have me come and inspect his final designs and watch his ""test runs.""I really feel like this is an heirloom quality toy with play potential limited only to a child's imagination. An enthusiastic five-stars from both mom and son!"
"This marble run is fantastic.  It looks great, works well, assembles easily, has both instructions/plans and opportunities for creative play, and is sturdy when completed.  My engineering-loving son, who has honestly not really loved marble runs up to now (although I've kept trying: this is the fourth one we've tried with him), loves this one.  The difference is that for him, the fun is not in being creative but following directions and making one like the picture.  This run comes with a booklet with instructions for 7 different designs, and there are more instructions on the manufacturer's website. (Although they are not sorted by the exact Quadrilla set, so you may find yourself looking at instructions that call for pieces from a different Quadrilla).Each model builds up quickly; perhaps 25 minutes or so for my experienced 7 year old, and it works so well that it's really fun to play with when it's constructed.  Since the pieces dovetail together and are not just placed on top of each other (as they are in the Tedco, Haba, or Magic Cabin sets), the entire structure is not easy to knock over and doesn't have to be treated with extreme care like a house of cards.  However, they are not ""snapped"" into place, either, like the Learning Journey sets, which is freeing because they can be quickly placed on top of each other.  The spiral loops are just as cool as they look in the picture, and we had lots of fun watching dozens of marbles on this run at one time.I was surprised to note that there are some plastic components to this run; mostly interior pieces that are unseen, or small tracking pieces attached to the larger run pieces.  Also, I'm not sure yet how easy this will be to create independent, creative structures: my son tells me that will be ""very hard"" but I think when he gets the hang of building all seven included models he will be more able to branch out with the materials with his own design.I'm very, very happy with this product!"
