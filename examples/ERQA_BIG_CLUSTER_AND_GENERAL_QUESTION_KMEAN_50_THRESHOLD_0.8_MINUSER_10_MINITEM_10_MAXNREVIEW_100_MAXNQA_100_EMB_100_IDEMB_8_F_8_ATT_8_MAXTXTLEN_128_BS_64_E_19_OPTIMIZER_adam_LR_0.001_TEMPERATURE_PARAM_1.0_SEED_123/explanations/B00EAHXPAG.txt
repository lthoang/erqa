can a 6 year old fire it
Top review:
The Nerf N-Strike Elite Mega Magnus Blaster has the power of a much larger weapon built into an oversized handgun. My children think it is the coolest-looking Nerf blaster to date for its semi-exposed barrel and outlandish size.The Nerf N-Strike Elite Mega Magnus achieves long ranges with significant power, making this an insanely powerful toy handgun. This is balanced by the small clip of only three Mega bullets.The fact that this is not the most accurate seems to be a bigger problem considering how fast these darts fly and how hard they hit.Whether up-close or dozens of feet away, shots from the Nerf N-Strike Elite Mega Magnus Blaster deliver a powerful sting. This-combined with its lack of accuracy-makes for a potentially hazardous (yet fun!) blaster.Use with caution.

Reviews:
Everything but the size of this Nerf gun reminds me of a shotgun design. It holds only 3 rounds. But you get a lot of power from each of those 3 rounds. You'll need to chamber a new round after each shot, just like a shotgun too. You get all the power and action of a Nerf shotgun, but in a hand-cannon size.This is a good back up gun. If you're going up against someone with a battery operated Nerf AR that has a clip of 30 rounds, you'll find yourself a little low on firepower. But this is a good gun to have as a backup in case of a foam dart jam in your main gun. It will buy you time to clear the action and still be able to pop off a few high flying rounds at the same time. I'd suggest picking up some extra darts for use with this blaster, in case the darts are damaged. Since damaged darts tend to get jammed in the guns while playing.
This shoots very far. That is part of the fun of this gun. It shoots much further than most nerf guns.It is very easy to use and very intuitive.it is easy to load and easy to cock and easy to shoot. Like most nerf guns though, it is not accurate beyond a short distance.However, the one draw back on this gun is it seems to jam easier than many other nerf guns we own, and with two boys you can imagine we own quite a few nerf guns.The good news is there is this little handy orange dot on the side of the nerf gun by the trigger, you push on it and it unjams the bullet. It seems to work for us with very little problems.Because it shoots so far you have to imagine there is some power behind the shot. Part of the reason the darts shoot so far is they are very light. However, as several of us can attest to after being hit, if you are hit up close by one of these darts it can sting quite a bit. You would absolutely not want to be hit in the face with one of these at close quarters.Buy extra darts.
I got this for my son for his 7th birthday. Of course they were a hit! You can't go wrong with Nerf guns! The only complaint I have is that it didn't come with more darts. Other then that, it's amazing! Shoots far. Easy to use.
The larger darts and power in this thing live up to its claims.  I was actually able to shoot about 95 feet or so - but that was pointing the gun at nearly a 45-degree angle.  Don't expect to really hit a target straight on from 85 feet; 20-30 feet for hitting actual targets is more reasonable.  As usual, the darts will waver in direction even at short distances many times.  Over long distances, this tends to even out, but sometimes at short distances it means that first hook will cause you to miss your target.On the downside, while this comes with 3 darts, there's no place on the gun to store them - that's kind of a bummer that there's not even a couple holes for that.  The gun is easy to cock, though.  It seemed best to me to cock it before loading the dart.The darts do whistle for a short while.  If you're shooting long distance, and have an arc on the trajectory, then you hear the whistle going up and then again just before impact (kind of like a bomb), which is pretty cool.  The darts also pack some punch, so be careful shooting at under 5-10 feet as they can hurt more than standard Elite darts.
Nerf guns are for outdoors only in our house. When the weather is warm they get a ton of use by our kids and the neighbors kids. They take a huge pounding and get thrown, tosses, kicked, and shoved in an outdoor bin at clean up every night. I've seen them get abused in all sorts of ways and they are still in good working order. Made to last is a gig deal here s I do not like buying stuff over and over. The only downside is that the gun should come with at least 20 bullets. They only included a few. I wish the bluets were cheaper too.
First off, my kids have a wide variety of Nerf Guns and other nerf-shooting products.  However, I really liked the Elite Mega Magnus Blaster as the darts are larger than the typical 1/2&#34; - 3/4&#34; darts that are used in nearly every other gun.  Easier to find on the ground, softer when they hit you because of the larger tip, and they fly farther because of the greater overall weight of the dart.The gun is top-loaded, which takes some getting used to - since none of the other guns we own are top load, we had to do alot of experimenting - but my 6, 9, and 13 yr old kids all had no problem with this mechanism once we had it figured out.  They gun is also VERY well built and solid which was nice - no seam/lap/fuse joints sticking out around the edges.  All my kids also had no problem firing the gun as the trigger is soft and easy to pull.Overall another very good addition to our &#34;Nerf Warfare Closet&#34;!!!
Gun has a good build to it and what seemes to be a fairly simple mechanism. Simply pull back to load, which also locks back the spring. It ships with three of the big darts. I have the sniper rifle with mega darts so I was familiar with the concept.Range is very good. Product page says 85 feet and I think that is doable with a little bit of arc. 30 feet or so is easy on a flat shot straight ahead. Put a bit of arc on it and they really start to take off. Accuracy goes pretty quick though if arced. Consistant shot power seems decent though. Only draw back is that although the gun holds 3 darts it comes with just 3 darts, it would have been nice to see it ship with 6. In little hands these things are going to be on roofs, etc....pretty darn quick. Even for me only a fortunate bounce off a tree branch kept one of my first 5 shots out of a neighbors heavily fenced yard as they go far.Good build, distance as claimed, nice nerf gun. Stock up on darts though.
This Nerf gun uses missiles/bullets that are significantly improved over what's been prevalent the last few years.  The blaster comes with three missiles that are loaded through the top into a vertical chamber.  The user thus pushes all three--one at a time--into the slot and then closes the pump.  The missiles are chunkier than what I'd previous experienced in the Nerf line (about two to three times thicker) and, while I didn't expect anything different because of that, I was surprised at the rate at which the first shot blasted out.  Way more forceful than the typical Nerf gun.  Kids should probably wear eye protection when battling it out with these.  Good stuff.
We (my kids) have been using this Nerf Mega Magnus for about one month and they give it a thumbs up.  This Nerf Blaster is an addition to their already large collection of 10+ other models.  But, this is the first &#34;Mega&#34; version they've had - aka, bigger darts.After fiddling with this myself vs the normal size blaster I will have to say I prefer the Mega better.  The bigger darts seems to fly farther and of course the whistling sound they make in the air is awesome.  For this particular Magnus - I find it easy to use but no clip limits the effectiveness in a dart tag war (can't reload quick enough).  Other Mega models may have a clip and that would be a nice option.At $11 I think this is a great value, only other knock I give it is that it only comes with 3 darts (so be prepared to buy more).  Overall, 4 stars in consideration of price/value.
ok - we have some 25 nerf guns in this house with boys who love their nerf warsthis gun is one of the latest favs that they all seem to try to get to firstthe pros are it is lightweight and the bullets are so easy to find when they are outsideit shoots much farther than many of their other ones that we havethe cons have to cock it every single time in order to shoot it only holds threethis is not one that you can use in stealth mode for others will easily hear your location before you shootit is a bit awkward to load it and am afraid will not be long before the bullets are damagedit is crazy how far when we have been outside that this one will firewe have had bullets landing on the very top roof of the houseand sometimes they have sailed over the house to the other side and land in the backyard
The Nerf N-Strike Elite Mega Magnus Blaster has the power of a much larger weapon built into an oversized handgun. My children think it is the coolest-looking Nerf blaster to date for its semi-exposed barrel and outlandish size.The Nerf N-Strike Elite Mega Magnus achieves long ranges with significant power, making this an insanely powerful toy handgun. This is balanced by the small clip of only three Mega bullets.The fact that this is not the most accurate seems to be a bigger problem considering how fast these darts fly and how hard they hit.Whether up-close or dozens of feet away, shots from the Nerf N-Strike Elite Mega Magnus Blaster deliver a powerful sting. This-combined with its lack of accuracy-makes for a potentially hazardous (yet fun!) blaster.Use with caution.
While this Nerf gun looks cool and the darts DO fly pretty far, it needs to be said that the gun isn't particularly easy to load. With enough practice demonstrations, my six-year-old (nearly seven) managed to load the gun, but never without difficulty. It definitely takes some strength to top-load the darts, and little kids just don't have the strength to do it. Also, because this gun only fires one dart at a time and then takes a while to re-load, it probably isn't going to be the gun that little boys are going to reach for, first. The guns with ammo clips may not fire as far as this one, but all of the time spent re-loading is going to get old pretty quickly when your son's buddies are pelting him with darts from their clip-fed dart guns. There's nothing particularly wrong with this gun, but there are better options out there if you are looking for a Nerf dart gun for your boys (or girls, though that would be a wonder).
This is a big gun in the hand but is fairly easy to load, cock and blast.  The darts really have great range I have watched them go over 100 ft all the way across the yard on occasion.  They make a magnificent high pitched whistle (usually) when they aren't stopped halfway through flight.  The top loading is fun and darts are durable and hold up well to repeated shooting.  I wish the gun game with more darts they shoot so far that they are easy to lose in trees etc.  Also be careful shooting other people with this one it really stings if you are too close.
First thing's first: this gun goes far. Really, really far. Way further than I thought it would, especially since it is SO easy to load and shoot! There's no pumping required, just cock it back to open up the internal clip, put the oversized nerf dart in, push the slide forward to load it and fire! Hit someone up close and let me tell you - you feel it!!The only big problems we have with this is that it can jam fairly easily. Because the clip is internal you sort of have to give a little bit of effort to get the dart in, and that seems to make it easier to jam the gun. The good news is that once you jam it, it's fairly easy to unjam.Our family did wish that there was an option to have an external clip so that we could have more than 3 darts loaded at a time, but this is definitely a fun addition to the Nerf N-strike family!
The kids love this one because it has the bigger darts. It actually doesn't shoot as precisely, but it also doesn't hit as hard. The look is awesome and is great for the Nerf collector.
Both kids and adults enjoyed playing with the Nerf N-Strike Elite Mega Magnus Blaster. It makes a nice loud chu-chunk noise when loading an arrow into the chamber and it does shoot pretty far. We weren't quite able to hit 85 feet but the arrows do fly a good distance. My only complaint and the reason I knocked a star off is that the Mega Blaster can rip the arrows if they aren't perfectly centered when loading. You'll definitely want to purchase the add-on pack of darts to go with this item as some will suffer the unfortunate fate of being mangled while loading. If I had to guess I would wager that it's because the foam wall isn't any thicker than it is in a normal Nerf dart, but because these darts have a larger circumference they don't have as much structure and are more susceptible to ripping and tearing. However, with that said it's totally a fun toy and both kids and adults were able to quickly and easily figure out how to use it without a problem and with little to no instruction.
Being an experienced Nerf gun enthusiast, my 9-year old is the expert in the family when it comes to these toys (he already has over a dozen so most of the review is from his words).  First, he enjoys the larger darts; bigger is better. They are fun and easier to locate once fired.  Although they are larger, they do not hurt more than the smaller darts (trust me I know).It took him a couple of tries to realize that you can load all three of the darts into the chamber at the same time (he's not much into reading instructions).  Most of his guns that fire multiple rounds have a detachable magazine, but he quickly realized the appeal of not having to load a detached magazine.At first, he did not like this gun at all, but that was due to the fact that he believed he could only shoot one round and then need to reload.  Once he figured out the chamber he really like the gun.  As far as the video for this toy, don't believe it.  You can't shoot a bucket of water of a truck hood unless the bucket is already teetering on the edge.
