"This is such a pretty baby and she looks just like my niece with blond hair and blue eyes.  Not surprisingly, she loves this doll.  The doll can be named by your little girl and comes in cute clothes--blue dress, pink shoes and matching pink bows in her hair.  She really does walk by herself, which is very intriguing to a young girl.  She also says lots of phrases to her ""Mommy"".  It needs four, double A batteries and I guess we'll see if this doll drains the batteries quickly...that I don't know about yet.The only reason why I didn't give this doll five stars is because it is so hard.  There is not a soft spot on it!  Usually, it's nice to have soft dolls, but if it is soft, then it wouldn't be able to walk.  Being that it isn't soft, it won't be snuggled with, but it will be easier to clean."

Reviews:
We have the Baby Wanna Walk doll with blonde hair and blue eyes. My four year old daughter was ecstatic to receive her, showering the doll with hugs and kisses. This was short lived (very short).The doll is made of hard plastic, making her somewhat heavy and there is nothing cuddly about her which hinders the 'nurturing mommy' aspect. She does have adorable pigtails, but the hair threading is sparse and very fine. She does have some sort of sensors in her hands, knowing when you let go of her hands, which is an interesting feature. Another pro is that she really does walk very well on carpet. At times she acts as if she will fall, amazingly she does regain her balance which also is quite remarkable. However, even with those pros listed, that is all the doll seems to do, is walk and teeter about. I am disappointed, she really does need more features. Even my daughter agrees. She played with the doll every day for only a few days, now it is just another abandoned toy in the toy box.
"I got this for review, expecting it to be mostly for my 16-month old daughter, but that it would probably be a while before she would enjoy it, and I thought my 8-year old might be entertained by it from time to time. They both like it. Little girls like playing mommy, so it's a big plus that the doll calls its holder ""mommy."" The fact that she can walk, and responds to touch (even to the point of giggling when she is ""tickled""), are nice touches, as well. And she has a cute look. The gripes? Well, my 8-year old says her hair is difficult to work with, that to let it out of its holders then put it back up is harder than it should be. My wife points out that her walking, which is the big selling feature and the most central functionality, is not as steady as it could be. I personally think that, for the purchase price, there could be some accessories thrown in, such as extra sets of clothes . . . so there are some imperfections, but overall I'd say this is a very fun, cute toy and I am impressed that both my daughters, who are ages over six years apart, enjoy the doll. I recommend this, with just those few quibbles I mentioned."
"My two daughters immediately loved this doll! My five year old especially took a shine to this baby and would not be parted from her.Baby Wanna Walk not only walks, but she also has sensors in her hands so she can tell when you are helping her walk along or let go of her hands.She also talks. She calls the person holding her hand ""Mommy"" and says things like ""I love you, Mommy"" and ""Don't let go, Mommy!"" She also can hum a little tune as she walks along. Yes, talking toys can get annoying for parents, so be aware that this is a noisy toy.If you push her tummy once, she walks and talks. If you push her tummy twice, she thinks you are tickling her and giggles.There is an on and off switch to save on battery life. The toy takes four AA batteries, which are included and already installed. So you can go right from box to play in under a minute.The feet the doll walks on are wide, making her very stable. She can walk in the kitchen or even outdoors on the driveway or deck. She has not fallen over once.We have a dog, and my dog was not bothered by this toy in the least.This toy is very popular with my kindergarten daughter, and would make a great gift. I am very happy with it."
"Many little girls love to play with dolls and this one really sets up a situation where the child can interact with the toy in a truly more ""pretend"" baby scenario.The doll speaks and actually can walk on her own. It almost seems as if it is communicating with the child -- very appealing for toddlers who are walking themselves and even older to maybe preteens. Little girls seem to love to play ""mommy"" and when the doll can ""talk"" it makes it seem more real to them. The doll is made of plastic, has a cute and colorful outfit, and actually does walk unsupported on linoleum and short carpet. I didn't try it on other surfaces, but I was impressed that it didn't need to be held onto and could stand on its own and move. No stair climbing though :)!The doll has about 40 phrases and says them randomly though sometimes it seems almost like it knew which one to say! The ""talking"" can be initiated by the press of a button on the doll's chest but also when she is walking she talks spontaneously.The doll comes with batteries (4 - AA) so you won't have any tears if this is a birthday or holiday gift! I believe it would be more appreciated by little girls older than 3 and by any who love playing pretend with dolls.If this is important to you, note that doll is also available in other than this blonde model:Baby Wanna Walk, BrunetteandBaby Wanna Walk, African American."
"While it is understandable that the doll must be a hard plastic material, I was a little disappointed in the difference between the textured, matte plastic of the doll's face and the shiny, unrefined plastic of the rest. I suppose it is possible that the matte plastic could eventually rub down to the shiny plastic after much (MUCH!) use ... maybe that is why it is not used on the remainder of the doll. Still I would think that the matte plastic would provide better grip for youngsters playing with Baby Wanna Walk. Consistency in material/texture would be most welcome here.Ditto for the doll's ensemble. The pinafore is an extremely stiff material. Now, at first I thought that softer material could get caught in the hip joints, but then I noticed that the shorts are soft. Therefore, the stiff dress must have been a conscience aesthetic choice. Odd. And, as you can note, the colors are a little gauche. Again, more delicate colors may have been a better choice. (Especially considering the overall ""toughness"" of this doll).Additionally, the packaging could use a little improvement. There is a cardboard insert by the doll's face that reads, ""She knows when you're helping!"" In my case, this cardboard had rubbed on her face repeatedly (I am assuming during shipping) and left chartreuse paint on her face. When I visited another toy store this weekend, I noticed the same problem with several of the dolls. Maybe a redesign is in order here ...  especially for this price.The doll does walk and looks adorable doing so ... no doubt. However, I did have a startling moment when one male child (a toddler) was enjoying the doll and it referred to him as ""Mommy."" He looked perplexed and then left the doll to his female playmates. How unfortunate. I thought we left ""gendered"" toys back in the 1960's. Being all inclusive would be as simple as not including the word ""Mommy."" What a pity.All and all, the doll does deliver on its promise. However, nothing about it is ""huggable"" or welcoming (even the hair is a bit stiff). You won't be tucking your child in with Baby Wanna Walk but it does have the potential to be fun (for short periods of time)!"
"Let me start by saying this was a big hit with our family!Everyone was charmed by this super-cute ""Baby Wanna Walk"" doll. It really walks, and it does a great job at it. We love how she teeters and then rights herself to walk some more. She even asks for help! These robot dolls certainly get more sophisticated every year.While playing with it, it says all sorts of phrases with a vocal chip that sounds crystal clear. The doll is also well-made and sturdy, which is more than I can say for some other ""hot"" holiday items of past Christmases.One note: just as you would suspect, this doll (robot) isn't really cuddly, so don't expect your child to sleep with it or anything.We love it, and we think you will to. Enjoy!"
"This doll talks in better/clearer English than ANY baby learning to walk. Real babies are just learning to babble Mama/Dada, but this doll can count and put together 4 word sentences! This doll meets my high standard for voice clarity. I expect it will challenge my granddaughter to talk more. They should add a switch to change the phrases to mention Daddy for boys.Some phrases this doll says are:""1, 2, 3 - Go.""""I did it!""""Hold my hands please!""""I love you, Mommy""""Up, please.""""Let's try again.""""Ready, set, go!""""I'm a big girl!""""Help me walk, Mommy.""And many more...""Baby wanna walk"" is thankfully the only phrase with improper English. The doll can walk several inches before falling over. It tries to mimic a baby with bad balance by leaning to one side and almost falling. When it does fall over, the doll senses it isn't upright and asks to stand up again.As with other electronic toys, it kept my early toddler granddaughter very entertained for a while before she wanted to play with the box in which it came. I've never quite understood the fascination with boxes, but it is very consistent no matter what the toy is - nothing against this doll in the least. As she continues to mature, she will enjoy it much more I'm sure.  Even though rather specialized, this is amazing robotics technology for the price.  I am a retired engineer and I just marvel how they did it."
Our five year old cousin has a vivid imagination, is very bright and boisterous. She shouted happily the moment she saw this doll and figured out how to use it with no instruction at all.She immediately began included the cute doll in her games, walking it across the floor. When I asked what she named the doll, she wouldn't tell me, so I made up silly names and she giggled. it was a fun game that capped off a very happy moment.
"This new Hasbro Baby Doll is a winner, and is sure to be enjoyed by the little girls in any family.  It comes in a large sturdy clear plastic container. Babbie Alive walks by herself, offers 40 plus phrases and sounds, and knows when you're helping her.  It may be a little pricey, but you get what you pay for.  We'll be giving one to our little grand daughter, and I know she will really enjoy playing with her ""new friend"" for a long time."
My doll-loving four-year-old daughter found her Baby Wanna Walk doll very disappointing. It simply wasn't fun to play with. As a doll, it was too stiff and heavy for her to work it into her general doll playing. And the walk feature just didn't work very well. It took adult assistance for a four-year-old to get it to walk and it usually fell down pretty quickly, even on our smooth wood floors. I read the other reviews describing the doll walking all the way across rooms on all kinds of surfaces; our experience has been different. Perhaps there was something wrong with our doll. Regardless, even if it did walk well, I don't think this would have been a favorite for my daughter; it is just too rigid and heavy for her to play dolls with. The doll still makes the occasional appearance as she plays.
The doll is cute and well made. But because there is hard plastic and because kids under 2 years old are not really social yet it is better to buy it for older girls.So 20 months old boy not interested in that toy, and I decided to get it because soon he will have a daughter. For now he prefers stuffed animals and cars;) However friends' 3 year old daughter loves to play with it when she visits. She calls the doll her own daughter, wants to change diaper, overal older girl is really interactive with it.
"My 3 year-old granddaughter just adores this doll! The dolls voice sounds like a real toddler not like a computer generated voice. It really does walk on its own, or sometimes it asks for help from its little ""mommy"". This doll stays at my house, of course, and whenever my granddaughter comes over it's the first thing she races for...her walking baby! It keeps her occupied for quite some time, which is an awesome thing right there as usually small kids have such short attention spans. It is expensive but it is well made and falls down a lot but stays intact. Sometimes my husband and I play with it (when no one is around of course!)just because we get such a kick out of it and it's so cute. If you can afford it, it's well worth buying!"
This is the cutest baby doll I have seen in a long time. My great grandaughter is 3 and her baby brother is learning to walk so I knew she would love this and it was a huge hit. She came over and I took it out and let her play with it and she said she was going to go home and help her brother walk becquse she was able to help her doll walk. I love the little sayings this doll has also. She said her baby was talking to her :)
"This is such a pretty baby and she looks just like my niece with blond hair and blue eyes.  Not surprisingly, she loves this doll.  The doll can be named by your little girl and comes in cute clothes--blue dress, pink shoes and matching pink bows in her hair.  She really does walk by herself, which is very intriguing to a young girl.  She also says lots of phrases to her ""Mommy"".  It needs four, double A batteries and I guess we'll see if this doll drains the batteries quickly...that I don't know about yet.The only reason why I didn't give this doll five stars is because it is so hard.  There is not a soft spot on it!  Usually, it's nice to have soft dolls, but if it is soft, then it wouldn't be able to walk.  Being that it isn't soft, it won't be snuggled with, but it will be easier to clean."
"My daughter is 6 years old and loves helping her baby to walk. Some sort of sensory device in it. It knows when you are supporting it and holding it's hands and it knows when it has fallen. It will ask for assistance and have you hold it's hands, and it won't start walking till you hold it's hands. It will also ask to walk by it's self and when it falls, it says ""Uh Oh"" and will ask for help being picked up. It is very verbal and is clear on what it wants to do. Also when it almost tips over, it will say ""woah"". It does a fair job at walking on the carpet, but it is intentionally unsteady since it is ""learning"" to walk."
My eight year old daughter is too old to play with this toy - or so I thought. We gifted it to my cousin's daughter, who just turned 5. She loves any sort of doll and was so excited to get this one she was ripping it out of the package! The doll works beautifully, and we loved that it came with batteries so that it could work right out of the box (although I did bring backups - ya know - just to make sure my cousin was annoyed for hours and hours on end!).What shocked me the most, though, was that my eight year old daughter got down on the floor and played with her young cousin! They both played with this doll for at least 45 minutes before they finally went onto other toys. My cousin reports that she is still working beautifully, even though she fell off the couch once or twice. I don't have much experience with the other Baby Alive dolls, but if they're anything like this one, they're definitely worth the money.
"I would think that the soft and simple ""huggable and snuggable"" dolls will always be most beloved... but this doll should provide some fun for little ones too. It provides interactive voice messages along with the walking activity.The doll is appealing to little ones in appearance and they quickly pretend with the baby as they assist it with walking. A fun supplement to beloved stuffed animals and more snuggable friends. :)4 AA batteries provided, recommended for 3+"
My daughter (almost 2 1/2 years old) absolutely loves her Baby Wanna Walk doll.  There are sensors in the doll, so it reacts appropriately when it falls down, or if her hands are held.  The doll says around 40 different phrases, in a clear distinct voice.  In the 2 weeks that my daughter has been playing with the doll, she has expanded her own vocabulary by learning many of the phrases that the doll says.  The doll is also helping her learn to follow directions better, since it asks her for help, and then reacts if she does so.The doll is able to walk on our carpeting, but does better on the tile floors.  It has a hard body, so it is not a doll to cuddle with.  My daughter has dropped/thrown the doll several times without damage, so it seems to be durable.  I think this doll is really meant for a slightly older child, but my toddler is having lots of fun with it.
I'm so happy I got this toy through the Vine Program. It was the perfect birthday gift for my 2 year old niece. She loves playing with Baby Wanna Walk and is fascinated by it. The doll reminds me of Baby Walk Away, a 1970s doll I had when I was growing up. Like that vintage toy, the doll is made of hard plastic and mimics the movements of a child learning to walk. The main difference is that Baby Wanna Walk is eeriely realistic due to computerized technology.Whenever my niece held onto the doll's hands, the Baby immediately called her Mommy and said other cute phrases. Her voice is amazingly clear. She also stops walking and gurgles and laughs when you press her tummy. The sensors allow the doll to keep her balance even when walking on slightly uneven surfaces, like the edge of a rug. We have hardwood floors and throw rugs and she was able to keep her balance on both with no problems.My main quibble is that this not the kind of toy meant for a child to cuddle with. It is a motion-activated toy that also eats up quite a number of batteries. But so far my little Lisa is having a lot of fun with her new playmate!
"This doll is awesome!  My 9 and 6 year old girls haven't stopped playing with it since it came off the UPS truck!  We have the original Baby Alive, so this one makes a great update.  The voice is clear and loud, and my daughters love that it calls them ""mommy""!  It's very sturdy, and walks great even on the carpet and tile floor.  My daughters have walked this doll all over our house- lots of phrases, so they never know which one is coming. It is for my 2 year old niece, and she is absolutely enthralled with it.  Highly recommend!"
