"LeapFrog Read with me, Scout, was an instant hit with my granddaughter.  The first words she uttered when she opened the package were, ""Grandma, it's just what I wanted!"".  She carried Scout with her everywhere and for a time, Scout even replaced her teddy bear.  She loves to listen to Scout and to follow along in her books.  She can now read the books on her own without Scout, but she still likes to listen to Scout read.The only problem is that she is now bored with the books.  There are 5 books, and they are color and number coded to buttons on Scout's collar.  You press the button marked 1 and read book 1, and so on.  Because the books are tied directly to those numbered buttons, I can't see that there is any way that more books can be added.  That's too bad because she's learned so much from these 5 books and additional books would be great.Pros:  Simple to use, easy to follow along with, has actually taught my granddaughter to read the simple texts.Cons:  What you see is what you get.  No ability to upgrade that I can see, so eventually the child becomes bored with the books and Scout becomes just a plaything."

I got this little dog for my granddaughter to play with when I babysit her a couple of times a week.  My granddaughter loves to have people to read to her but it is not always feasible to drop everything to read to her so this seemed like a good alternative.  The dog comes with five little books that he can read to you by pushing a button on his color that corresponds to the number on the book.  These are nice as you can read them to her when you do have the time for cuddly time.  The dog has several places that if you touch him he will interact with you but be careful where you touch him while he is reading a story because he will interrupt the story to say something else.  He has a sleep mode that you can have him play music or read you a story.  He isn't very cuddly because of the electronics.  My granddaughter loves him and will play with him for a long time and carry him around which is a bit difficult as he is alittle heavy.  I think he is worth the price and she is learning her numbers and colors and having fun.
"I love every LeapFrog product I've tried for my daughter so far!I'm trying to read to her often and expose her to lots of books so that hopefully she will enjoy reading the older she gets.This Scout toy is a great idea.  He is super cute and very soft and she loves to cuddle him.  There is a night time setting that plays lullabies so she can snuggle as she goes to sleep.  The story mode is great for during the day - you just pick a book and push the corresponding number on Scouts collar.  Scout coaches your child to turn pages as he reads the story and if they get distracted he encourages them to get back to reading the book.  The stories are great, very educational.  Scout is very perky and makes it fun.There are sensors on Scouts head, face, and back and he responds when your child pets him or kisses him.I love toys that have multiple purposes and this one fits the bill - it is a cuddly plush toy, it plays music, and it's also an educational ""learn to read"" toy too.  Highly recommended!"
The plush dog itself is really cuddly and cute. The learning experience is great, too.The books that come with Scout, the dog, are simple and easy to understand, and quite adequate for the upper portion of the advertised age group (24 months - 5 years). I really doubt that a 2-year old baby, given that it is not the next Einstein, would manage to learn anything here, except how to cuddle a plush dog. But for 4-5 year old children, this works just fine.Operation of the dog is intuitive and can be managed quite well by the child after a short introduction. The dog reads the books and asks questions about it, and it also has a sleep mode, where it plays lullaby tunes that shut off automatically after 8 minutes or so. The dog seems to be built very durable, and the books are on heavy card board paper.
For me, this is one of the best LeapFrog products I have come across. Especially in the 2-4 year old range when you are introducing your child to reading. A bridge to the other LeapFrog products for older kids.First I was very impressed with Scout, the dog. Just as a plush it is very cuddly and cute and well constructed. But of course this is all about how Scout interacts and helps with reading.You get 4 cardboard colorful books each with a different color strip. There are 5 colored numbers on Scout's collar. Push the number and find the book and Scout starts reading and prompting for the next page. Also Scout asks questions. This has been shown to v
Our two year old twins love Scout.  He is a great size and they carry him around everywhere.  This really is a neat concept where Scout has several books and you pat him on the head to activate things like page turns etc.  Once we showed our kids how to do this they got the hang of it immediately.
"My three year old daughter was very happy with Read With Me Scout.  Scout comes with five color coded books.  When you press a button on his collar, Scout will say something like, ""Pick up the RED book and pat my head when you are ready"".  He then reads the book and comments on it, asks the child to pat his head to turn the page, etc;The books are short and easy. What I liked best about Scout is that my three year old was able to pick up what to do pretty quickly. I did the book selection and head patting a couple times to show her, then she got the picture and was able to do it on her own.  Very nice!  I would say that is not always the case with similar toys, especially for younger children. (Mine just turned 3 in the past month.)The ""do it myself"" factor was really nice. She's carried Scout and the books around quite a bit this week, showing everybody what a big kid she is now.I don't think this is expandable like some other leapfrog products. I could be wrong, but I think you're limited to the dog and these five books.  But at this price its probably still a good gift for a little one who will grow out of this soon enough and start asking you for an ipad or something."
"Having played with Scout and shared his ""abilities"" with a child, I can report the following:Pros:-Delightfully over-sized!-Extraordinary attention to detail! His ""fur"" is a sort of incredibly soft microfiber (?) while his ears are a different but equally as soft fabric. The adorable embroidery is just ""icing on the cupcake.""-Huggable!-Excellent array of reading material.-Easy to use. (Even for a little one!)Con:-Voice is affected and shrill. It becomes unbearable to my ears after about three minutes. Unfortunately, the same tween actor performs the voice of Violet also ... so, there's no escaping it if you elect to use these products. The overacting is so brutal that I had to move to another room at one point. Nonetheless, I think that children are accustom to this sort of stilted voice-work from lower-budget morning-cartoons; therefore, I doubt that they care.Obviously, Scout does not take the place of one-on-one reading time with a child (nor does any other device). Nonetheless, as long as you can tolerate the saccharine voice-work, Scout can be a great supplementary learning device."
"I realize that for many children this is a great toy, but for my 3 year old son it just didn't do the trick, I will attempt to explain why.My son is used to thee primary types of indoor entertainment, TV (too much unfortunately, my fault), stories (read by us, or a device like scout) and playing with toys/drawing etc..  Of these his choices rank as follows.1) Watch TV while playing with toys with Mommy or Daddy2) Watch TV3) Playing with toys with Mommy or Daddy4) read a book with Mommy or Daddy5) Play toys by himself6) ""Read"" an interactive book on the iPad (or have the iPad read him the book)7) ""Read"" a book by himself (look at the pictures)8) Color/paintSo when my son does choose to have a book read to him electronically, he chooses an iPad app, probably because he likes pressing the buttons and interacting directly with the book rather than simply patting the dog.  Additionally, the stories that the toy came with, while educational, don't really hold his attention.  On the iPad there are many more options, that will both attract and hold his interest more successfully.The toy is durable, and for many seems to work really well, but my son just isn't that interested in it and frankly I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.  I think my son said it best, ""I don't want scout to read the story, I want daddy to read it.""This is a fine toy, but it fills a niche filled by tablets and a niche that otherwise doesn't really need to be filled.  But, as always you know your own children best, so if they love reading and love stuffed animals or dogs (and don't have real ones) this may be a great toy for your child.  Also it is a lot cheaper than a tablet if  you don't already have one."
Scout is Big, is soft to hug and is so cute and educational, I like it has a volume button so you have the option to not have a loud toy and it can be turn off too. The colors are rich and vibrant, Scout voice is sweet and the interactive spots are easy to understand. Like all Leapfrog toys this one is a good quality toy.
"I have a number of LeapFrog toys for my 2.5 year old. I have really liked most of them. This is the first one I've found that I dislike.From my child's perspective, it's a big hit. Scout is soft - huggable, interacts with him (positive feedback when he pats his head, rubs his body, or cheek). The interactive spots are clearly marked and easy for young kids to see. He's been holding tight to Scout since we got him and I think it's a toy that is likely to endure in the affection phase. ""Let me go get my doggy, Scout!"" He can manipulate the button on the collar that navigates between night time (where actions are limited) to ""Story time"" where all the trigger spots are active. There are 5 books that come with the product, and 5 buttons on his collar. The directions are easy. ""You pressed button 1! Let's look for the red book. It has ____ on the cover."" So he's been able to locate the books just fine, even though the numbering on the book is small and in the right hand corner.From a parent perspective, Scout is too easily triggered. My son is sitting on the floor with Scout, reading a book, and barely touches him. Scout stops reading and says his interaction (like ""Ooh, that tickles!"") It's also not interactive in the way many LeapFrog products are where you can program them with your child's name and customize it. The ""Read with Me"" function leaves a lot to be desired. My son is doing very limited sight reading, and I don't think these books will help with that. First, the easy triggering means there are a LOT of story interruptions. There is a significant pause before Scout starts reading again after he says, ""Let's get back to the story!"" Because the on/off/night-time/story-time switch is easy to find, placing Scout in ""night time"" mode so he doesn't get stopped hasn't been a successful tactic - my kid just pushes the switch to ""Story time"". I also don't think these books really help kids learn to read. The stories are simple and Scout does ask interactive questions, but I don't think it's a highly educational toy.On a positive note, the buttons on Scout's collar that correspond to the story are the same color as the book, so even if your kids don't have number recognition yet, they could figure it out. I also like the number of lullabies that are included in the night-time version. My child is not a champion sleeper so it's unlikely he'll ever have anything electronic in his bed (otherwise he'd NEVER sleep), but it makes for some nice wind-down time before bed.In summary, my kid loves this toy. From my perspective, it falls short of the item description and goal. I'm certain he'd give it 5 stars. I would give it 2."
This was out of the box and set up to work within 15 minutes of its arrival on my porch.  14 of the minutes were spent trying to get it out of its packaging while an anxious little 4 year old girl was holding on to my apron strings.  Actually she was yanking on them but I hate to tell tales on her.The children do get all excited when they see ANYthing LeapFrog comes out of one of the smiley boxes.  They love LeapFrog.Once she had the dog and the 5 included books, she was all over it.  She figured out all of the possibilities very quickly and then SHE showed ME the things the dog could do.  Then she showed her 5 year old brother how Scout works.  I know he really appreciated it.Like all things LeapFrog, Scout combines learning and fun.  He reads the books to the children while they read along and stops to ask questions about the story. He engages children in reading rather than just reading the story.  This is research based.  Children need to be actively engaged in order for learning to take place.For me, the limitation is that he has 5 stories.
"Scout has become the friend to Eli, a four year old boy, who I worried would be aging out of Scout's intended audience age. After all, Scout only comes with five short books and he also sings, but there isn't too much else to his functionality--besides well constructed, durable cuteness. Eli loved that one of the characters in the books is also an Eli (a purple cat) and he enjoyed rereading the books with Scout over and over.A few qualms: There is no expansion of Scout's library. Five books and that's it. They are fine books with educational concepts, but those are not emphasized by Scout. There's no ""Hey, these words rhyme!"" Or ""the word 'orange' is written in orange."" Pretty much Scout reads and will bark or make a sound to accent the book action (a horn noise) when he prompts for his cheek to be patted. Any extra learning possibilities with the books will need to be handled by the adults in the room. There is more scope, but Scout doesn't provide that especially since he will read the books without the books present, too. He doesn't sense them but is only prompted to them by the collar input.Our Scout may be defective, but patting his head only had about a 50% success rate for page turning which often lead to harder patting which would then press his neck down on the collar number buttons and then start a new book over. This didn't frustrate Eli too much although the adults in the room were not amused. Eli would just go scrambling for the next book as if a game were being played.Overall, during the first four days of play, Scout was returned to over and over again despite the enticement of many other toys in the room so he was a hit.Scout is very soft and huggable despite his electronic innards so that is a boon to making him just a highly functional stuffed animal, too, which let's face it, most kids love."
Out of the box this toy was hot. My 3 year old was obsessed with it and played with it constantly for 2 days. He literally has not touched it since. Very surprising considering how much he liked it at first.I think the issue is that once you have read the books a few times, and pushed all the buttons, there really doesn't seem to be anything left to do.The nighttime setting is nice because it will read the book through without stopping for activities or to wait for the child to push a button. It also mellows down the dog and doesn't keep prompting the child to push buttons. They daytime setting is much more interactive, almost confusingly so, my son would get frustrated because the dog kept making him push a button to continue reading the story.There is no way to expand the program in the dog and no way to personalize it. Overall this was an alright toy, that maybe my son will like again someday. It isn't our favorite of the leapfrog line though.
My time with Scout provided the first experience I've had with the LeapFrog line of educational toys.  I was impressed at the quality of construction and clarity of sound, as well as the thought that went into the design.Like every new toy that my 29-month old daughter receives, Scout was quickly promoted to the short list of toys without which she couldn't possibly go to bed.  Thankfully, there is a bedtime mode that can be activated from the switch on his collar, in which some of his buttons are disabled, and the music is changed to a bedtime theme.The books that come with are appropriately paced for young children learning to read (two lines of text per page spread), and Scout's reading voice is appropriately paced to help them learn without being painfully slow.Unfortunately for us, the five books that are included (and beyond which Scout probably can't be expanded) failed to capture my daughter's interest for long -- they are board books without many pages, and it didn't take long for familiarity with them to breed disinterest.  Now Scout is just an occasionally-played-with stuffed animal, whose corresponding books don't get a lot of reading.If the system could be expanded to include more books, I think this would have captured my daughter's heart more (and certainly been a great way to let her get more reading practice during some of her solo play time).  Nevertheless, it's still a great toy, and one I would recommend.
I can't believe how great this toy is!  My 2 year old loves it.  It is everything LeapFrog has promised it would be, and my son won't stop playing with this gem!
"The stuffed dog is adorable and well made. The books are just OK, nothing special.Although my 4 year old son loves the dog, he just isn't interested in the ""read to me"" feature. He pushes the buttons and enjoys interacting with the dog, but when he wants to read a book, he brings one to me or his mom, reads it to himself, or uses his iPod.I really think this could be a great learning toy for the right child, it just wasn't a big hit in our house."
"Reviewing this for my 3yr old he's a huge fan.  The dog is a bit big for him but it goes where he goes and the books come along about half the time too.  He's figured out how to work all the buttons for stories and ""talking"" and can turn Scout to Sleep Mode when it's nap time all on his own.From a parent stand point I'm at a firm ""meh""...  the animal is soft and cuddly, batteries last forever.  It's limited to five books and that's it, so nothing more to buy, but kinda limited.  Good news is that you don't have to have the books for the toy to work.  There is a volume switch.  The dog's buttons are a bit sensitive for my liking but it doesn't phase my 3yr old.Again my 3yr old loves it and it's been around for about two weeks now and still getting a good bit of play time, or at least I want this around while I play with something else time."
"We're pretty big fans of Leapfrog toys at our house. This one is another high quality pick. However, it's been less of a hit with us than many of their other products, making it ""good"" but not a favorite.First, here's what I like: it's an appropriately slow-paced toy for the age group, much like an one-on-one storytelling experience. There's some real active engagement that allows children to interact and be involved rather than passive entertainment. The matching books with the buttons on Scout is a smart way to let young children pick which story they want (or can find at the moment!) As with other Leapfrog toys, it's well designed and seems developmentally appropriate. Reading to your kids is one of the best things you can do for them. While this doesn't replace it, it's a great alternative when you can't read (like if you're driving) and lets them start interacting with books more independently.My son hasLeapFrog My Pal Scoutand has loved it, though his recently stopped talking after a couple of years of use and a few rounds of being dropped down the stairs. So he was thrilled to see the appealing friend in another cuddly format. Even baby brother lights up to hear this puppy read them stories.The reasons it's not a knock-it-out-of-the-park hit with us? While my son's near the middle of the age range (wasn't four yet when he received it) the limited number of stories and simplicity of them mean they haven't held his attention span for too many readings. It's probably a good gift for someone nearer the age of two. While the Sleepy Time mode (where Scout simply tells the stories without questions) is a smart option, we found it was still too stimulating for bedtime and kept him awake. (Original My Pal Scout worked well for bedtime when he was younger.) The library is limited to the five board books that come with Scout. That's not bad, just means it doesn't have the long-run expandability that some other Leapfrog reading toys have. Finally, the design does mean keeping up with five board books. For a child as young as two, this means they'll need a good amount of guidance to have the books accessible to use, but not have them be separated from Scout and lost among other regular books.However, none of the above caveats are real complaints. This is a good toy, and I'd say a great pick if you're looking for a gift for someone turning two. It just may not beat out some other five star options, including many Leapfrog picks."
"The bright green puppy will appeal to the youngest of toddlers for its vibrant primary color.  Scout waits for the child to follow directions to proceed through the stories.  Simple commands like ""Pat my back"" direct the listener through the reading.  Recommended age is 2-5 and I suggest this for the younger end of the age range.  Toddlers advanced in language skills will be ready for this pup even before the recommended age of 2 (with adult supervision)."
I have to say I agree with all the other reviewers.  I love how soft and cuddly this is.  It's not like most talking toys which feel soft until you squeeze them and feel hard plastic on the inside.  The talking box on the inside is barely noticable.Most of what I am going to say is reflected in most other reviews, so I will just re-iterate the fact that it is a great learning toy, and the only thing I don't like about it is the annoying voice.  But my kids love it!
"I have always loved LeapFrog toys for my kids.  My teenagers had Leapfrog toys when they were small and now my three babies do.  I have never been disappointed by LeapFrog and this is no exception.  Read with me Scout is available in green and violet; I received the green toy to review.Scout is so cute.  He comes with five color coded books, which he ""reads"" to your child.  My two year old twins are just beginning to identify colors, so this toy has really helped them to learn the basics. (Scout asks the child to fine certain colors of books, etc)  My twins usually play independently, but lately they have been sitting together so Scout can ""read"" to both of them.  It has been dragged around the house and in the van on several trips, and he looks none the worse for it.  I'm not sure how long they will remain this interested (since there is only five books) but for the past month this toy has seen a lot of play time at out house.As for the concern that some reviewers have that Scout will replace parent/child reading time, I think that is ridiculous.  Obviously the toy is not going to replace one on one time with parents, and I really hope that most consumers realize that.  Scout is designed to be a fun toy, not a parental substitute."
Scout is adorable - I've never seen one of these before and he is the perfect size and softness to appear to little ones everywhere and adults for that matter as well. Probably even more important though is that it's easy to operate and encourages a love of books and reading. The questions and auto responses will help little ones develop a larger and stronger vocabulary and they have fun at the same time.One minor complaint is that Scout is easily activated: it actually scared our mail lady by activating when she drove over a bump in our road. The same is true while reading one of the books: a little motion will cause the book to stop and an expression to be activated -- it then takes a little while for the book to begin. It'll probably be something that will annoy adult readers , but not little ones.Overall - I think this is worthy of 4/5 star rating
I have one incredibly happy five-year-old.  It seems that Scout now has a permanent place - attached to her side.  He's big, cuddly, and cute.  He asks for kisses and pats, can sing, and tells a pretty good story.  Scout comes with five, very cute books.  They are perfect for beginning readers, containing both basic sight words and a few more challenging words.  Scout reads them in a cute, sing-songy way that sticks with you.  After a few times having Scout read the books, my daughter picked them up and began to read them to Scout.Scout also has a bedtime mode (wonderful for a tired mom!) in which he tells stories and sings songs.  I do find the bedtime mode just a little loud, but it doesn't bother my daughter who snuggles Scout until she falls asleep.I found myself wishing Scout came with a few more stories, but when I mentioned that to my daughter, she informed me that Scouts stories were perfect and that five was just enough!A very cute toy and I love the fact that it definitely encourages my daughter to read!
"There's a lot to like about LeapFrog's ""Read with Me, Scout"", but you'll quickly discover that Scout is no replacement for reading a book with your little one in your lap.  This is true for parents AND (more importantly) the kiddos.Scout's got a lot of tech crammed into him, much more than your average squeezable, interactive plush toy.  Set up is a snap (we had Scout unboxed with the help of a scissors in less than 3 minutes).  You begin by pressing a color coded button on Scout's collar that corresponds to the cover the chosen book.  He's got a pleasant (but somewhat on the loud side) voice that sings songs, giggles when hugged, asks your child questions that relate to the story being read (e.g.: ""Do you feel happy or sad?  When you feel grumpy, what helps you feel better?""), and of course reads one of five stories.  You can pat Scout on the head to move along with the story or follow one of his other instructions (e.g.: ""Pat my cheek to hear my elephant sound!"").The interactive portions are above average in their creativity compared to other similar products on the market.  Nonetheless, you'll still get what you pay for.  This isn't a supercomputer that has infinite variability and/or artificial intelligence.  After one time through each book, the rapport starts to sound very repetitive.  Kids pick up on this nearly as quickly as the adults who wish Scout was in another room.  The replay value is therefore limited, which you'll soon discover after you've burned through the five short board books.The first time we played with Scout, play time lasted just over 15 minutes before my 4-year-old moved on to the bubble wrap he came packed in.  (Honestly, it held his attention almost as long.)  Play time has diminished since to the point where Scout is a nearly forgotten afterthought in our home.It's easy for me to say, since I received Scout courtesy of the Vine program, but I cannot recommend this highly enough:  Take the money you're thinking about spending on Scout, supplement your child's library with quality picture books, and enjoy some precious reading time... together."
I must say that Scout is one of those toys that really get the young one's attention; he's so cute and cuddly yet works really well as a reading aid for young children.  Scout is like a little Nanny, he keeps them entertained in the day and helps to put them to bed at night.The Nice Features List1) Cuddly and cute and actually bigger than one would expect.2) Interactive with the children, it reads books and the kids set the pace by patting him when they want a page changed.  They can also play other games involving Rhymes and patterns, colors and events. Scout accepts touch input to signify the choices the young one is making.3) Sleep mode for getting the young ones to bed:  Scout will read a story for several minutes then power himself down.  This is very cool for nights when you're very busy but is of course no substitute for reading to your child whenever you can.4) Large repertoire of material, the books are about 5 and the question list seems pretty long, certainly long enough that I did not hear a repeat over the first 2 days.The not so great List:1)  Ughhh the packaging.... Arghhhh... If you're getting this for a Christmas gift I highly recommend you get it out of its armored shell before wrapping it.  My child went bonkers waiting the 15 minutes it took me to get Scout free of his prison.2) The voice could be better but it's pretty much like all the other Leapfrog toys, it's a little grating for the parents but the kids don't seem to mind.3)  Scouts a bit impatient, he does not wait a too long for a response from a question, it's long enough for most kids but could be a problem for very young kids.Overall I am very happy with Scout, he's well worth the price and younger kids will have lots of fun with him.
"The ""LeapFrog Read with Me, Scout"" looks very similar to the ""LeapFrog My Pal Scout"" but has some books with it that Scout can read.  We have both the Leapfrog book that Scout narrates about things ""on the farm"" (which is entirely made of plastic) and the ""My Pal Scout"" and this version of Scout really is a mixture of the ideas both offered.There are a number of buttons on this Scout that will make Scout do different things.  There are numbers on his collar that correspond with the books that Scout reads.  Once a number is selected, Scout sticks to reading that book.  There are also buttons on his back and head so you can pet Scout.  I like how Scout gets back to reading the story even if he was interrupted.  And your child has to interact with Scout for him to continue reading (so it isn't just one long recording of the whole book).Younger kids could pay with this toy without problems, but probably not understand enough of the commands needed to interact with it so that Scout can read the whole book."
"LeapFrog Read with me, Scout, was an instant hit with my granddaughter.  The first words she uttered when she opened the package were, ""Grandma, it's just what I wanted!"".  She carried Scout with her everywhere and for a time, Scout even replaced her teddy bear.  She loves to listen to Scout and to follow along in her books.  She can now read the books on her own without Scout, but she still likes to listen to Scout read.The only problem is that she is now bored with the books.  There are 5 books, and they are color and number coded to buttons on Scout's collar.  You press the button marked 1 and read book 1, and so on.  Because the books are tied directly to those numbered buttons, I can't see that there is any way that more books can be added.  That's too bad because she's learned so much from these 5 books and additional books would be great.Pros:  Simple to use, easy to follow along with, has actually taught my granddaughter to read the simple texts.Cons:  What you see is what you get.  No ability to upgrade that I can see, so eventually the child becomes bored with the books and Scout becomes just a plaything."
"This is a really neat toy.  Leapfrog's mascot Scout will read one of the five included books to your child.  Although my children love this toy, they prefer just to play with it and hug it, rather than have it read to them.  The few times my son has tried to have it read, he is too impatient and turns the pages long before Scout is through with them.  I think this toy would work best with children who are really good listeners and patient enough to follow along with Scout.  However, it does have the feature for Scout to just tell the story without the book, and this is really nice for the more impatient kids.  My 23 month old daughter is also too impatient (or young) to follow along with Scout but she loves to give him hugs, inspiring Scout to say ""You're nice. I like you!"" repeatedly.  Overall, I like this toy and think it is a really original idea.  If you have children who have the patience to follow along with Scout, you will get the full use out of this toy.  Otherwise it makes a good storyteller and cute toy for your kids."
Scout is really cute. The main thing I noticed (as a sewer) is the quality construction. The construction is great--accents are embroidered on, not stickers/transfers. Labels on Scout are obvious (to adults) as to what they refer to, and the ones on his collar are both number- and color-coded.From a little one's perspective (on the low end of the age range): The best thing about Scout is that he's happy and hug-able. And when you push the star on top of his head, sometimes he pants and barks. This is something to really laugh about! But what do all these books have to do with Scout?From my perspective: The books are simple and sturdy board books. There's not much to them, but Scout will ask questions about the books (when not in nighttime mode) to help make them more interactive. Unfortunately, though, this is another LeapFrog item that interrupts itself. I have the LeapFrog Learning Table and it does the same thing. Kids at the lower end of the age range don't really get cause and effect, which means there will be a lot of interrupting going on. I wish that they would start adding an option to override this feature on their toys for really little ones. Unfortunately, my nephew, who I allow to play with the toy, loves to push the book-coded buttons on Scout's collar. This just ends up with Scout saying that he's going to read a story. Over and over again. For some reason, those buttons are more enticing than the pressure-point buttons on Scout. Because cause and effect isn't obvious for kids on the lower end of the age range, I see this as a toy that he'll eventually grow into. Some day, he'll realize Scout wants to read books with him when he's visiting. Parents of younger kids might opt to keep Scout turned off until kids understand speech and are able to concentrate on the books. For adults who don't like repeating/interrupting, the toy maybe should get a 3-4, but I have to go by a kid's rating, and, in that regard, it's a winner.Here's a quick tip upon Scout's arrival: Open up the Velcro in Scout's belly. There's a switch inside that has two options for volume (high and low). It's very loud at first, and is a lot more pleasant at the lower volume. The nighttime mode also offers a quieter volume.
On the plus side, my almost six-year old lit up like a light bulb when I showed him Scout.  Just loved him.  I think he wants a dog.  Badly.  Batteries are included, and that's always nice.  Scout did elicit some participation from my boy which is kind of cool.  He responded to the questions Scout was asking.On the downside...the biggest issue is that the questions Scout asks really gives little to no time for the child to answer.  My kid is on the top end of the age scale and he was actively working to answer Scout's questions when Scout was ready to move on.  Rather rude I think for a toy designed for social interaction.  It seems like Scout gives you 5 seconds and that's it.  Strangely, Scout seems to respond affirmatively regardless of the child's response.  This seemed very confusing.  I can't imagine what kids will think.  Especially if the kid comes up with the wrong answer and Scout tells him he's right.Minor nits - the instruction manual really didn't have instructions.  The back of the box explains functions and the volume selector switch on the battery pack.  Given the box is one of those you really don't keep, parents may want to keep the box as reference.  Even better would be to include the information in the leaflet provided.Also, the item itself is limited to the five short books.  Better would be the ability to either get more books or provide longer books.I think my my son were writing this review he'd probably give more than three stars given his response.
This stuffed Scout is a nice big size and really good quality. The collar makes it easy to figure out which button goes with which book.  Scout also talks to you when you press one paw and sings with music when you press the other. Even without all the talking he is just plain cute.
This is our first Leap Frog product and as far as we can explore it now, we like it. This review of the toy is fairly limited as my child is a tad young for it and the only way he is able to play with it is limited to hugging and patting. And he likes it!:) The toy is made of a very soft and pleasant material. Once we can actually utilize the interactive features, I will update this review. My question for now is, will thee be more books available for this toy, can it be upgraded at some point, or this is it?
