"This product claims to be educational because it helps with fine motor skills and cause and effect. Isn't playing always educational? A child is using his/her brain, so therefore, it is educational no matter what you are playing.Basically, it's just fun. My 6 year old thinks it's cool because it has General Zod and Superman in it. His favorite part is the gun that shoots little things across the room. He didn't really care about Superman's outfit. The toy basically has two arm-like features that Gen. Zod and Superman can connect to. You press the button and then they fly towards each other to fight. On top of the play set is a place where you can put Superman's outfit inside a room with a door. If you move the lever, the door pops open displaying superman's outfit. On the other side of the playset is a gun that shoots arrow like weapons. This can come off the play set. A lot of the pieces are removable, like the gun, the outfits, the play figures. This is fun for the child because they don't have to keep it within the set. Not so fun for mom when he starts whining ""What happened to General Zod?"" But for play purposes, it does the job.The toy is also really sturdy. The one thing I did not like, however, was that sometimes superman and Gen Zod didn't really stay inside the arm like things to fight. Sometimes when I pressed the button to make them fly toward each other, Superman would fall off. That's minor, but overall the toy is a lot of fun for my son and that's what matters."

Reviews:
My almost 5 year old nephew LOVED the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset!  Awesome toy! It is great for his age group.  Some instructions, or a more detailed picture on the back of the box, would have been helpful.  There were a couple of features that were confusing for him.  Overall, though, a great superhero toy for an almost 5 year old.
My 5 yo loves the imaginext series. This set a a bit smaller than the other play sets, but is still fun. It comes with two characters--superman and a villain. The playset is not too sturdy and if not careful, will topple over without much effort. There is a turntable that causes a door to open when activated. Several projectile missiles are provided. NIce edition to the other imaginext sets ie the batcave. This will probably be more fun for the 7 and younger super hero fan.
After getting both versions of the Batcave from this company, this is my first Superman purchase. The playset is incredibly limited compared to the Batcaves. Even taken as its own toy, it's limited in what a kid could do with it. You can put both Zod and Superman in clips and then have them fly at each other in aerial battle with the push of a lever. A small spaceship is on the side that opens when you turn the dial. Also there is a reveal for Superman's chest emblem and cape. A small gun shoots plastic missiles as well. It may seem like a lot, but a three year old child gets bored with it rather quickly. It's a cool display piece and initially gives the child some stuff to explore, but it's very limited in replay value. It is durable though and looks like it will hold up pretty well. Also, I don't know if it's just my set or not, but Zod didn't come with the robe he is pictured here with. He is just in the plain black jumpsuit with his symbol on it.If you are a collector, you might like this. If your child is a Superman fan, they'll probably enjoy it for a little while. If you have other pieces in the collection (especially other figures) it might be a fun place for a galactic showdown. As a standalone piece, however, it might not hold their interest too long.
The Imaginext Superman Playset is a quite a bit smaller than I'm used to seeing from them (Our Family Room is filled with large Imaginext Pirate Ships, Batcaves, and Castles, as well as Dinosaurs by the dozen...), but it does pack a lot of features into it's compressed size.First off, our package arrived with no instructions whatsoever, and we still haven't figured out just what you're supposed to do with the weird little exo-skeleton thingy. We put it on Zod's back, but who know if that's where it's supposed to go....? There's also an assortment of swords and little Kryptonian shards that can fit into various spots in The Fortress of Solitude. There's a little jail/cage thing, a weird compartment that holds Superman's cape, and, best of all, little waist harnesses that enable Superman and Zod to fly around and fight. Neat feature!Overall, this is a small set, but it has enough interesting features to make it worthwhile, if the price is right.
"We have several Imaginext sets in our house. As with the other sets, the smaller ones have less to do and the larger ones have more to do. This is one of the smaller ones and there really isn't too much interactivity. Superman's cape is stored in a chamber that opens when the red disc is turned. There is also to connectors for Zod and Superman and when the lever is pulled they fly at each other or ""fight."" What you don't notice from the images is that the back has a door for a jail ro another room, and there is a computer room hidden in the bottom of the back as well. There are also to swords and missiles for the launcher. I do like to the new style of launcher which has a rounded bottom instead of the perfect fit bottom that is in other units. The ball allows for more motion on the launcher.This also has a set of cuffs for Zod. In the picture they are yellow, but they are red in the set we got. Not that big of a deal. The red gives more of a red kryptonite feel.Finally, this has a superman crystal that reminds me of the crystals in the original superman movie and the Fortress of Solitude. Speaking of which, I am not sure why this isn't just called the Fortress of Solitude.I like how it has two figures, especially Zod who you can't find in a figure pack.Anyway, my five year old is having a blast with this set. Any Superman or imaginext fan will like it. My only complaint is the limit in the interactivity. It is nice and small and lightweight for travel too."
This Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman playset is smaller that I thought it would be.  My son is a little older (7) and has not played with it as much as he has his batcave and some other Imaginext Sets.  It's a great addition if you have other super hero playsets, which is what my son has done.  I am not sure it would be too much fun on its own.  It is durable and colorful.  Well suited for 4-7 years old.
We have a huge collection of Imaginext toys so when there was an opportunity to add this to my son's collection I jumped.  I should have noticed from the pictures that it was pretty small.  I would say it is maybe 12 inches wide by 12 inches tall, as an estimate.  There is not a whole lot to do with this set like there is on some of the other sets we have (the old batcave, the jungle, pirate ship) so my son lost interest pretty quickly.  It is well-made but overall it doesn't provide value.
"OK, so Fisher-Price isn't the same as it was when YOU were a kid.Newsflash!Neither are today's kids.I understand that people are sceptical of tie-ins with movies, but that at least is familiar to all of us. That has always been around.I think the biggest complaint for the Imaginext line for me, which I DO have, myself, is the quality for the price. The plastic is not as high quality as it should be.However, I disagree on a different point with a number of the other reviewers here.I am talking about the ""boredom factor"" mentioned. It seems to plague many of the parents or reviewers.I have one question. I do not mean to offend people, just to make them think.Take a 6 year old, for example (not a 3 year old--this toy is recommended for 36 months to age 8!!!-- unless the 36 month old in question is a card carrying member of MENSA), and try opening this WITH him or her ... and playing with it TOGETHER!It is kind of similar to learning to read a book, when you learn to play. You need guidance. Ages 4-6 (which I figure are the most appropriate for the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset) are still encompassing fairly young children.Reading to a child in that age range makes books something which will then be loved far more than if a child just looks at books by him or her self.It is the same thing with a toy like this. Don't expect a toy to be a babysitter.Play with your child when you offer your child the toy.There is lots to do with it! We like it very much.I hope you understand that I am not dissing everyone who called it boring.I am just providing a different perspective. Thanks for reading!Mom of five sons here! :)jean"
"I gave this to my 5 year old son.  He absolutely LOVED it, for the first 2 or 3 weeks.  He was playing with it every day, taking it apart and putting it back together, bringing his other ""guys"" (dollar store army men and so forth) into it for the first few weeks.Maybe it's just his age (he just turned 6) but he's not quite so interested in it anymore.  It could also be that it's summer break and he's spending more time outside.  If he starts playing with it again as it gets cooler outside I'll update but for now it seems to have lost his interest.  The set is sitting on top of the toy box waiting to play I'll see if he gets back into playing with it soon..."
My boys love anything dealing with superheroes, so they were really excited to get this playset.  They played for thirty minutes solid with this, and they picked it up again for a few minutes the next day.  The problem with this is that it just doesn't do much.  It also is one of the smaller Imaginext playsets, why it is on around $20.  There are a few moving parts and rocket launchers, but overall, this fell a little flat.  I think with added Imaginext pieces, such as vehicles and additional people, this would probably be more fun.  Because the price is reasonable at $20, I still think this is a good, solid toy for any superhero fan.
I got this for my 3 going on 4 year old.  He *loves* superhero toys and this one is no exception...eyes lit up and he's been playing with it almost non-stop for a couple of days now.It's not quite like the Superman of my youth, as it's more of a tie in to the Man of Steel movie than the comics, or so it seems.  Superman's cape is removable and can be stored in what looks to be a Super Closet.  All sorts of fun battles can be had between Superman and Zod, including the use of small props (which will undoubtedly be lost at some point) and little missiles that shoot out of a cannon mounted on the set (which will also undoubtedly be lost).I think kids older than 4 would probably get bored with this set fairly quickly, but for kids at that early range...it's a winner!
"My nephews, ages 2 and 7, were not very taken by this toy.  It doesn't do too much, it's small, and they don't really know who Superman is.  Not to mention, this toy is up against all manners of battery-operated gizmos and ipads that just draw them in so much more easily.  They did play with it a little- there's a ""jail"" area, a gun that shoots a missle that is easily lost.  There's a section where you can put Superman and Zod in this harness thing and have them fly at each other.  That section is kind of weak because the grip is really weak and the guy goes flying off it really easily.  It's smaller than you'd think - maybe a foot tall.  But for the price, it's OK.  I mean it comes with two guys and it does shoot a missle (which is easily lost).  But, again, my kids don't know who Superman is so they just didn't care.  I mean when you're up against Angry Birds and Pokemon - Superman just doesn't register.  My little 8-month old niece liked chewing on Superman, though!"
This is probably my fault. My son has little to no attention span for regular toys now. He only wants to watch tv, play on the iPad, or play basketball. Anything that requires  extra imagination on his part gets tossed to the side. So, although I thought this toy was cool he pays no attention to it.The pieces are rather flimsy. Nothing like the Tonka Toys we played with growing up.
"I have to admit that I'm a huge fan of the Imaginext line of toys from Fisher-Price.  I've been buying Imaginext toys for my son for a few years now, primarily from the Dinosaurs, Sky Racers, and DC Super Friends lines.  What I like about them the most is that while these toys feature popular characters and themes and come with neat features, they leave most of the ""play"" factor up to young childrens' minds.The DC Super Friends Superman Playset is no exception to this rule.  The playset comes with Superman and Zod based on the characters as they appear in the ""Man of Steel"" film.  The set somewhat looks like the Kryptonian expedition wreckage (apparently the Fortress of Solitude) that Superman discovers early in the film.  There is an enclosure for Superman's cape that opens with a twist of one of the figures on a base.  A missile launcher with a missile is included.  Two weapons that can be held in Superman or Zod's hands are also included.  There is a base that you clip both figures into and a lever that can be pushed to make the characters ""battle"" one another.  My son enjoys this features and plays with it repeatedly.  Once a winner is declared, the loser can be locked up in the included chains.  A key is also included that fits into a base in the center of the playset.  Folks who've seen the film will recognize this key.As with most larger Imaginext playsets, this one features plenty of nooks and crannies that can be used to lock up enemies or hide things during adventures.  My son has been playing with this set in his free time almost nonstop.  All of the other toys in the Imaginext line are compatible with this one, and he has used Batman, Green Lantern, Robin, and all of the villains he already has in this set.Recommended to anyone who wants to spur their child's imagination.  This is a fun toy!"
"This set was a big hit with my three year old grandson, and the six year old played with it too.  The main attraction was the ""projectile launcher"" which shoots pretty far but not with too much force.  It also comes with a cape for Superman, swords, handcuffs and my personal favorite, TWO figures so that they can interact with each other.  Many sets include just one, and you immediately have the added expense of adding on. I thought there was enough to do with this set to justify the reasonable cost."
My 4 year old has Toy Story and Batman Imaginext playsets, so I thought he'd enjoy this playset. He does very much. It comes with Superman and Zod figures. The playset is smaller that the others we have, and the compact size makes storing it much easier. Compared to the others, though, it doesn't seem as durable. There's a mechanism on the toy where you can attach the 2 figures, and manipulate a lever that's supposed to make them battle each other (not sure if you can tell what I'm talking about from the picture), but it's very flimsy and doesn't really work right.
"This product claims to be educational because it helps with fine motor skills and cause and effect. Isn't playing always educational? A child is using his/her brain, so therefore, it is educational no matter what you are playing.Basically, it's just fun. My 6 year old thinks it's cool because it has General Zod and Superman in it. His favorite part is the gun that shoots little things across the room. He didn't really care about Superman's outfit. The toy basically has two arm-like features that Gen. Zod and Superman can connect to. You press the button and then they fly towards each other to fight. On top of the play set is a place where you can put Superman's outfit inside a room with a door. If you move the lever, the door pops open displaying superman's outfit. On the other side of the playset is a gun that shoots arrow like weapons. This can come off the play set. A lot of the pieces are removable, like the gun, the outfits, the play figures. This is fun for the child because they don't have to keep it within the set. Not so fun for mom when he starts whining ""What happened to General Zod?"" But for play purposes, it does the job.The toy is also really sturdy. The one thing I did not like, however, was that sometimes superman and Gen Zod didn't really stay inside the arm like things to fight. Sometimes when I pressed the button to make them fly toward each other, Superman would fall off. That's minor, but overall the toy is a lot of fun for my son and that's what matters."
My little guy loves Superman.  He has Superman story-books, Superman t-shirts, Superman pajamas, and even Superman sneakers, but this is his first Superman toy.  When I started taking this playset out of the box, I was immediately dismayed.  My son is only three, and even though the toy is designed for 3-8 year-olds, its features seemed a little too complicated for a younger child.  I was wrong because he figured out most of it before I did, and I was reading the back of the box.It's a decent little toy, but I wasn't really blown away.  Some of the smaller parts, like the little swords and shackles, seem almost superfluous.  There's no place to store the little projectiles that fire from the launcher.  We have theFisher-Price Disney's Jake and The Never Land Pirates - Jake's Musical Pirate Ship Buckywith water cannons, and there are places to insert them in the ship so they don't get lost.  I do realize this is a minor complaint, but it is a small example of how this toy could be better.  However, my son was pleased with his new toy, and it kept him occupied for over an hour this evening, so I'm pleased as well.
My grandsons, 6 and 8 have other Imaginext toys, including the Batcave, so this was a nice addition. The set is durable, and comes with two figures--Superman and General Zod. As others have said, the set is small and doesn't do as much as the others, but... the boys love the figures!  They especially wanted Superman. On its own the set might not have held their interest, but they use the Fortress with their other sets to create a lot of imaginative play, so we gave this 4 stars
"A toy should be a gateway to a child's imagination.  Unfortunately the Superman playset does little to inspire that imagination.  Its small, cheaply-built mold touts a Battle Arena where Superman and General Zod can fight, but in reality the arena is two plastic clips that just make the characters rock back and forth at each other, more like they're on a see-saw.  I find it hard to believe any child would use this wonky mechanic instead of their own two hands.But hey, there's a gun turret on the top of the Fortress of Solitude just like in the... well, nothing.  That has never been part of any Superman mythology.  Well on the up side it comes with swords, because when I think ""Superman"", I think ""sword duel"".  Sigh.Look, in the end my 6yo took Superman and General Zod from this set right to her Legos.  Which is probablythe set I should've gottenin the first place.  The Imaginext set seems well-enough built for a cheap toy, but since I don't forsee it getting much play I don't think quality will be a factor.  Inspiring play?  On that it fails entirely."
There isn't a whole lot to this toy.  I picked it up through Amazon Vine for my daughter, who happens to love super heroes, and while she loves to play with the Superman and Zod action figures, the playset itself doesn't seem to interest her much.  It has a little jail in the back, two props for holding each figure so that they can fly at each other, a missile launcher, and a container for Superman's chest plate and cape.  The container is a neat feature, but my daughter was disappointed that Superman himself couldn't fit in it because it looks like a rocket ship.Because there isn't much space for the figures to stand on this playset, and because there isn't much for them to do other than fly at each other with the props, I wouldn't recommend this toy.
This toy can be safely put away into the next Goodwill giveaway or recycling project. I am inclined towards recycling. It is cheaply made junk. The minute it is out of the box, disappointment hits you. I happened to take it out of the box next to Playmobile set. The difference is staggering. The plastic it is made of looks cheap,the toys do not have detailed features, everything has that poorly made look. Total waste.
I am a huge fan of Imaginext items!  This Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset does do everything it says it does, however, it is a bit smaller than I had expected. It has the same durability as the other sets, just be sure to look at the dimensions and make sure this is right for you.  I was not fond of the lever that you use to have your figures battle it out, but my kids do and that's all that matters, right?  If you are looking for  a smaller playset,  then you would probably be happy with this one. My kids loved the figures the most!
